# <h1>Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges</h1>

## 1. Introduction

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “Modern societies are increasingly dependent on digital technology and infrastructures; for this reason, malicious cyber operations can cause serious harm to individuals, industry and states. Such harm can be physical, digital, economic, societal, political, psychological, reputational, it can affect security, or be a combination of all of these factors. For example, the cost of cybercrime is reported to be between US$799 billion and US$22.5 trillion globally,1 whereas the US government estimated the cost of malicious cyber activities to its economy to be between US$57 billion and US$109 billion in 2016.2 These are dazzling figures, but even small-scale malicious cyber operations can cause serious and long-term harm. For example, tampering with even one voting machine can delegitimize the entire electoral process.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 942)

## 1. Introduction

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “Individuals, industry and states thus have an interest in preventing and supressing malicious cyber operations,3 in mitigating or redressing the harm they cause and, eventually, holding those responsible to account. Attribution is critical in this context because it refers to the process of assigning a particular malicious act to its author: the physical perpetrator, but even more importantly, the mastermind.4 Attribution therefore acts as a catalyst for taking appropriate and effective technical and legal action to prevent and supress such activities and to establish responsibility. Conversely, non-attribution undermines the process of assigning responsibility and frustrates response action.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 942)

## 1. Introduction

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “This article will study the legal methodologies and determinants involved in the process of attributing to states malicious cyber operations falling below the use of force and armed attack thresholds as a prerequisite for engaging their responsibility. The discussion is confined to the law of state responsibility because attribution is one of its constitutive elements and because the function of the law of state responsibility is to maintain international legality by holding states responsible for their wrongful acts.5” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 942)

## 2. The Current State of Attribution of Malicious Cyber Operations to States

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “Attribution in cyberspace has traditionally been presented as a challenge because of anonymization, the falsification of identities, the multi-stage nature of cyber operations, the dynamic landscape of cyber threats, the undifferentiated nature of cyber tools, the human and technical resources required in performing attribution and the lengthy timescales involved. State attribution has been even more challenging for the same reasons but also because of the serious political and legal consequences that attribution or misattribution may trigger. However, the initial rarity of state attributions gradually gave way to ever more frequent attribution claims as a result of improvements in attribution capabilities coupled with the changing attitudes of states towards state attribution.8 Although we are not going to examine all of these attribution claims in this section, we will highlight certain important features they reveal about the attribution process which will provide some of the context to the discussion that follows.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 944)

## 2. The Current State of Attribution of Malicious Cyber Operations to States

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “The first feature relates to the actors involved in attribution, which include governments, civil society9 and the private sector, working separately or in collaboration.10 For example, one of the first and most influential attribution reports by a private company was by Mandiant (now FireEye) which named Unit 61398, a unit within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), as being the host of ‘Advanced Persistent Threat 1’ (APT1), which was linked to acts of cyber espionage. According to the report, ‘[t]he issue of attribution has always been a missing link in publicly understanding the landscape of APT cyber espionage’. The report then noted that ‘it is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China’.11 Since then, there has been a substantial increase in attributions of cyber operations to states by private sector companies. Regarding state-to-state attributions, the first took place in 2014 when the US government publicly attributed the Sony attack to North Korea.12 Since then, there have been many more state-to-state attributions, including coordinated ones, such as when the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan attributed WannaCry to North Korea;13 the UK, USA, Denmark, Australia, Canada and New Zealand attributed NotPetya to Russia;14 or when the UK and allies attributed the activities of APT10 involving theft of intellectual property and sensitive data in Europe, Asia and the USA to the Chinese Ministry of State Security.15 There have also been coordinated state and private sector attributions, such as when US government agencies16 and the private security company Crowdstrike17 attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails during the 2016 Presidential election to Russian state actors.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 945)

## 2. The Current State of Attribution of Malicious Cyber Operations to States

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “Secondly, existing attribution reports show that determinations of attribution are multi-sourced and can differ in the amount of information and evidence they contain. Moreover, their degree of analysis and their assessment methodology is often inconsistent or just unarticulated.18 This has raised questions about their reliability and validity.19” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 945)

## 3. Technical Cyber Attribution

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “Attributing a cyber attack begins with a technical analysis of data that results from the attack. Aseries of actions is required to execute a successful cyber attack. Analysts use this trail of actions and the related data, along with an established body of knowledge based on previous events that includes the methods and tooling of already known malicious actors, to attempt to trace these operations back to their sources. Although there is no standardized model of cyber attack, from existing models25 we can say that the cycle of a malicious cyber attack includes a number of stages: the preparatory stage of target identification, reconnaissance and weaponization; the engagement and presence stage of delivery, exploitation, installation and actions on objective; and the effects and consequences stage. Analysts collect as many data points as possible from each stage in order to associate them with online personas, individuals and organizations. Data points that demonstrate potential relevance and/ or uniqueness to a forensic investigation are considered indicators. Key indicator categories are tradecraft, infrastructure, malware and intent, as shown in Table 1. The US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) made this matrix publicly available to demonstrate the concepts behind their internal framework for attributing malicious cyber activity.26” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 947)

## 3. Technical Cyber Attribution

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “The first indicator category, tradecraft, refers to the collective behaviour frequently used to conduct cyber attacks, which forms a pattern that can be seen across time and location. This is arguably the most important indicator category, because human habits are more difficult to change than technical tools. Examples of tradecraft are payment and financial transactions, email and social media accounts, types of infection and delivery methods (e.g. infected USB drives or compromised websites) or actions on objective (activities inside the target/victim network). However, although an attacker’s tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) can be unique tradecraft indicators, they can diminish in importance once they become public and other actors can mimic them.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 947)

## 3. Technical Cyber Attribution

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “The second indicator category, infrastructure, refers to the physical and/or virtual communication structures used to deliver a cyber capability or maintain command and control (C2) of capabilities. They include, for example, domain names, dynamic DNS services, IP addresses, proxy servers and anonymity services. Attackers can buy, lease, share and compromise servers and networks to build their infrastructure. They frequently establish infrastructure using legitimate online services, from free trials of commercial cloud services to social media accounts. Some cyber-threat actors are reluctant to abandon infrastructure because of habit, cost or time, while others will do so because they can rebuild it within hours. This indicator category is very powerful and is relied upon heavily along with tradecraft in many attribution assessments. Although some attackers routinely change infrastructure between or even within operations to impede detection, skilled analysts actually use this to their advantage by drawing even more nodes and edges in a graph of malicious activity.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 948)

## 4. Attribution in the Law of State Responsibility and Its Determinants

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “Attribution in the law of state responsibility is a normative – not a factual or technical – process whose function is to assign a wrongful act to a state in order to engage its responsibility.35 For this reason, its determinants are moulded by how the state is defined, which in the law of state responsibility is reduced to the structures, entities and functions that make up its legal-political order. This makes the legal determinants of attribution quite narrow, requiring an identifiable, direct and close link between a state and an entity or between a state and the impugned conduct; a link that overrides the latter’s independent existence. This occurs when an institutional, functional or agency link between a state and an entity or conduct is established.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 952)

## 4. Attribution in the Law of State Responsibility and Its Determinants

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “The institutional link covers the relationship between a state and its de jure or de facto organs.36 De jure organs are entities that are defined as such by the state’s law. This would be the case, for example, with Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) officers indicted in relation to the DNC hacking.37 It will also cover entities, cyber defence groups or hacker groups incorporated into the state apparatus, such as the Estonian Defence League,38 Unit 61398 of the Third Department of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army,39 Israel’s Unit 8200, or Bureau 121, a hacking unit within the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).40” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 952)

## 4. Attribution in the Law of State Responsibility and Its Determinants

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “De facto organs are state instrumentalities. They include entities, groups or individuals who are completely dependent on a state and over whom the state exercises control ‘in all fields’.41 From an examination of existing jurisprudence, it transpires that if an entity has been created by a state, operates on behalf of that state and has no real autonomy in decision-making, it is a de facto organ of that state. Contracted-out cyber groups or companies may also be included, but that would depend on the terms of the contract and how it is executed, in particular whether the outsourced tasks are closely linked to the state such as security tasks, and whether their delivery is controlled by the state. That said, proving such a close relationship is particularly difficult and, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated, it will be quite ‘exceptional’ to qualify entities as de facto organs.42 For example, the US government characterized three North Korean hacker groups including the ‘Lazarus Group’ as ‘agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities of the Government of North Korea’,43 which in principle alludes to the attribution criteria discussed here, but it provided no evidence to substantiate the claim.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 952)

## 5. Evidence and the Standard of Proof in Cyber Attribution

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “As was noted in Section 2, existing attribution reports are quite thin on the evidence they contain, and they are often quite obscure in their assessment methodology. Moreover, certain states, such as the USA, UK and France, claim that they are under no obligation to disclose the evidence upon which attribution is made.58 However, employing a methodologically sound process of analysing and assessing evidence, and a cogent standard of proof, are critical for the credibility and validation of attribution because evidence can substantiate attribution determinations and justify subsequent actions. This is true in legal as well as non-legal – technical or political – processes of attribution. As the 2015 UN GGE Report explains, ‘accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’.59 It is, therefore, important to examine how cyber attribution can be substantiated as a matter of law because, as was said, states may be called upon to justify their determinations and the lawfulness of any action, for instance countermeasures, they may take.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 956)

## 5. Evidence and the Standard of Proof in Cyber Attribution

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “In this section, we will discuss the types of evidence and the standard of proof required to establish cyber attribution. The discussion will be informed by the relevant jurisprudence which, notwithstanding its relative under-development and its heavy judicial focus, provides the minimum context for understanding how evidence can be legally used and assessed. In our opinion, such discussion is important because it will provide useful insights that can be used beyond the legal context because, as the ODNI document presented in Section 3 shows, there are parallels between legal and non-legal standards of evidence.60” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 956)

## 5. Evidence and the Standard of Proof in Cyber Attribution

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “With regard to the first issue, the type of evidence, it goes without saying that data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations are the primary category of evidence to be used in legal determinations of attribution. As indicated in Section 2, they may include, amongst other things, malware samples, compiler language, programming language, IP addresses, domain names, registration information for infrastructure, payment information for infrastructure, patterns/ordering of execution events, keyboard layout for malware creation, scripts and programmes used on a victim network or host. What can also be used is documentary evidence such as cyber strategies, legislation, attribution reports, directives or intelligence reports (even in redacted form).” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 956)

## 6. Proposals for Improving the Legal Methodology and Effectiveness of Attribution

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “In the light of the challenges surrounding cyber attribution, we will now consider a number of proposals and whether they can make cyber attribution and its methodology more efficient and effective. The first proposal is of an institutional nature and envisages the establishment of an international attribution agency to centralize and streamline attribution determinations; the second proposal is normative and envisages the revision of the attribution determinants to capture the reality of cyber-threat actors and their connections to states; whereas the third proposal seeks to identify a standard of proof that can facilitate the making of reliable and credible attribution determinations.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 959)

## A. International Attribution Agency

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “There are many blueprints for such an agency, ranging from an agency with purely private-sector membership, an agency with private-public membership and a purely intergovernmental agency.75 For its proponents, an international agency that centralizes and streamlines attribution determinations and processes will engender trust in attribution against the current state of decentralized, often inconsistent and methodologically obscure determinations. It will also lead to the standardization of attribution by establishing its own attribution methodology, rules of evidence and decision-making process. Moreover, such an agency can assist governments or courts in making more informed and persuasive decisions. Other advantages are that it will contribute to the depoliticization of attribution but also to its democratization in view of the inequities in states’ cyber capabilities. However, whether such an agency can attain these aims depends on its independence; the nature of its membership and its representative character; its financial transparency; its decision-making process and standards; its investigatory competence; its technical, political and legal expertise; its attribution methodology; the standard of proof it applies; and the vigorousness of its oversight mechanisms.76” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 960)

## A. International Attribution Agency

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “In our opinion, the above represent a rather demanding set of conditions and it is doubtful whether they can ever be satisfied. There are also other factors that cast doubt on the desirability as well as the feasibility of such an agency. The first and perhaps most important factor is that the functioning, utility, authority and effectiveness of such an agency will ultimately depend on the willingness of states to cooperate and accept its findings. Yet, many states view attribution as part of their sovereign prerogative, and do not feel obligated to provide information when they make attributions. This is the US, UK and French position and also the position of the European Union and NATO.77” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 960)

## A. International Attribution Agency

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “Secondly, even if states exhibit some cooperative spirit in this regard, they will still want to protect their networks from prying eyes, something that will hinder the work of such an agency. Furthermore, victim or perpetrator states may demand access to the information the agency used in order to make its determinations, which the agency may not be able to provide if such information is classified.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 960)

## B. Revision of the Attribution Determinants

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “The second proposal concerns the revision and readjustment of the attribution determinants, focusing mainly on Article 8 of the ARSIWA. It should be said, in this respect, that revising the attribution determinants is neither unreasonable nor against the law, and we will explain why. First, regarding the criterion of ‘control’, Article 8 of the ARSIWA does not specify its scope, whereas the commentary notes that this standard should apply with a degree of flexibility. This means that there is room for readjustment.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 961)

## B. Revision of the Attribution Determinants

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “Secondly, the emergence of special responsibility and, for this reason, the emergence of special attribution regimes have been recognised by the ILC, whereas the ICJ admitted that the attribution determinants may vary depending on the area.79” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 961)

## B. Revision of the Attribution Determinants

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “Thirdly, it should be recalled that the determinants of Article 8 of the ARSIWA were developed in an era when states created armed groups to fight proxy wars and these groups were dependent on states for direction and resources, such as weapons. The descriptors in Article 8 of the ARSIWA thus reflect such unequal and vertical relations between states and non-state actors. However, the circumstances where Article 8 of the ARSIWA is called upon to be applied have changed and more so in cyberspace. Cyberspace offers a particularly facilitative environment for non-state actors to emerge and operate, and many non-state actors in cyberspace are often self-sufficient, autonomous and pursue their goals either independently from states or in alignment with them, but such alignment can be, variously, formal or informal, vertical or horizontal, continuous or ad hoc, attached or detached.80 In this context, states may just offer political or ideological direction and support to non-state actors rather than material support.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 962)

## C. Standard of Proof

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “The third proposal tries to identify a suitable standard of proof for cyber attributions. It was said in Section 5 that current attribution claims do not rely on any particular standard of proof and that international law is quite ambiguous in this regard. This offers a degree of flexibility, but, in order to identify a standard of proof which is suitable for cyber attribution, it is important to understand the nature and function of the ‘standard of proof ’. Regarding its nature, the standard of proof is context-specific and may vary depending on the domain or the circumstances. Also, the standard of proof is gradated; it describes degrees of confidence but never absolute certainty. This is as true in law as it is in political (intelligence) assessments, which use standards of low, medium or high confidence, and it is also true in technical assessments, as noted in Section 3. Regarding its function, the standard of proof assists decision-makers to make reasonable determinations on the basis of the available evidence, which is especially important when the quantity of evidence is low and its quality needs to be assessed, as in the case of cyber evidence.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 966)

## C. Standard of Proof

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “It follows from this that applying a very high standard of proof to cyber attribution, such as that of ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’, may increase its factual and legal reliability but may frustrate determinations and consequential action, whereas applying a low standard may affect its reliability and may lead to erroneous decisions with serious repercussions for the acting as well as the victim state.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 966)

## C. Standard of Proof

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “In our opinion, the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ is the most appropriate standard for proving attribution in cases of less serious malicious cyber operations which are the focus of this article. According to this standard, attribution will be established if more evidence supports a particular attribution finding than contradicts it. The ‘preponderance of the evidence’ is not a new standard but one that has already been used in international jurisprudence, as was shown in Section 5, and it is a standard which is also employed outside the legal context. For example, with regard to the attribution of the WannaCry attack, the US National Security Agency determined that the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ pointed to North Korea.98” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 966)

## 7. Conclusion

### Attribution is essential for addressing responsibility gaps in cyber operations.

> “The preceding discussion has shown that attribution matters for the suppression of malicious cyber operations but also that it is a multifaceted process. The article has presented the methodology and determinants of the technical and legal processes of attribution and explained how they interact. It has also considered what body of evidence can be used to prove attribution and what the applicable standards of proof are. The discussion identified flaws and gaps in the existing methodology, determinants and evidentiary standards which lead to responsibility gaps.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 967)

## 7. Conclusion

### Proposed reforms aim to improve legal attribution methodology and standards.

> “For this reason, the article discussed a number of institutional, normative and evidentiary proposals with the aim of improving the methodology and process of legal attribution in order to close the identified responsibility gaps. The article discussed first the possible contribution of an international attribution agency to the streamlining and standardization of attribution, but concluded that the creation, operation and effectiveness of such an agency would depend on state cooperation which is not forthcoming at this point in time. The article then put forward a number of normative proposals to re-adjust the legal determinants of attribution. They include amplified standards of control in the form of ‘overall control’ and ‘soft control’ and the inclusion of implicit instructions as an attribution determinant. In the authors’ opinion, these proposals can capture better the realities of cyberspace, the place and role of nonstate actors therein and their multi-layered relationship with states, and, thus, address the responsibility deficit that the narrowness of the existing determinants generates. The article finally proposed the ‘preponderance of evidence’ as the most appropriate standard for proving attribution because it guarantees adequate scrutiny of the evidence whilst also facilitating attribution determinations.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 967)

## 7. Conclusion

### International law must engage with cyberspace to ensure accountability.

> “All in all, the article is informed by our belief that international law should not withdraw from cyberspace, but that it should face and shape cyber reality by establishing a regulatory framework within which states, individuals and other entities can operate and be held to account. Our normative and evidentiary proposals assist in building a legal framework for ensuring responsibility and for inculcating a culture of responsibility in cyberspace.” (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 967)
