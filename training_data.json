This gap has resulted in challenges in holding state-sponsored actors accountable for their cyber activities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Recognizing that customary international law has not developed a set of understandings or recognized state practice on what level of attribution is acceptable or necessary for establishing state responsibility for cyber actions this paper intends to address that gap.' (Greiman)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The legal requirements of attribution are clearly lacking due to the failure of a universal consensus on the laws, regulations and standards that are applicable when attributing a cyber-attack to a state-sponsored entity.' (Greiman)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 2: The Role of Politics in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>Political considerations often influence the decision to publicly attribute cyber-attacks, impacting the transparency and consistency of attribution practices globally.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Identifying the responsible actors for cyber-attacks is a monumental challenge though politics usually determines whether attributions are made public.' (Greiman)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The political aspect includes assessing what is at stake in making the attribution judgment, starting with the damage incurred, whether physical, financial, or reputational.' (Greiman)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 3: Technological and Evidentiary Challenges in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>Attributing cyber-attacks involves significant technological challenges and requires a comprehensive analysis of various types of evidence, including technical forensics, human intelligence, and signals intelligence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Cyber attribution is the process by which evidence of a malicious cyber activity is collected, analyzed, and identified with the attacker.'

(Greiman)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 4: The Need for International Cooperation and Norms</h3>\r\n  <p>The study emphasizes the necessity of international cooperation and the establishment of norms to effectively address cyber-attribution challenges and mitigate cyber conflicts.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This requires multilateral cooperation and an international agreement on the rules and norms that govern cyber attribution both at the national security and economic level to better meet the needs of our evolving cyber landscape.'

(Canfil, 2020, p. 29)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Public responses are associated with a five percent increased likelihood that an adversary will instead rely on its own operatives in future periods.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 29)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 2: Evidence of direct state involvement does not significantly provoke a subsequent US response.</h3>\r\n  <p>The research indicates that the US does not show a significant increase in response likelihood even when there is irrefutable evidence of state involvement in cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'There is no significant association between the US having obtained irrefutable evidence of a sponsor’s involvement and its willingness to respond publicly ( p = 0.35).' (Canfil, 2020, p. 29)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The US may be able to more accurately detect and attribute systems, but its ability to implicate individuals is apparently unrelated to how eagerly it retaliates against the usual suspects.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 29)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 3: The effectiveness of proxies is diminishing due to increased US technical capabilities and willingness to indict host states.</h3>\r\n  <p>The findings suggest that the traditional use of proxies by adversaries for plausible deniability is becoming less effective as the US enhances its technical abilities to attribute cyber attacks and its readiness to publicly hold host states accountable.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The US government is both increasingly willing to indict host states for their connection to proxies, and increasingly capable of providing technical evidence to substantiate its accusations.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 23)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Punishments may be more regularized under the US’ new policy of persistent engagement, and more states now see an interest in fostering robust, centrally operated cyber institutions.'

The reliance on public data and the challenges associated with obtaining reliable evidence of state involvement in cyber operations are significant hurdles.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Though caution should be used in interpreting these results given limitations in the data and secrecy in cyberspace more generally, they offer tentative support for the theory that proxies may no longer pay.'

(Canfil, 2020, p. 32)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: Observational Equivalence</h3>\r\n  <p>The research faces the issue of observational equivalence, where different underlying processes could produce similar observable patterns. This makes it difficult to determine whether changes in behavior are due to decreased outsourcing or increased stealthiness of operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This potential for observational equivalence is all the more reason why we should be cautious before uncritically adopting the “plausible deniability” assumption.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 32)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'In short, observed patterns are produced by one of two mutually exclusive data-generating processes: a true decline, or a turn away from ineffective proxies in favor of even stealthier alternatives.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 32)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Fixed Effects Limitations</h3>\r\n  <p>The use of fixed effects models, while addressing some concerns, introduces limitations in making substantive comparisons between units. This statistical approach can reduce the ability to interpret the results meaningfully across different contexts.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Caution should be used in this interpretation, since fixed effects limit the number of comparisons. The difficulty in making substantive comparisons between units is a principal downside of fixed effects.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 30)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The need to compensate for the strong possibility of selection bias outweighs limitations in interpretation.'

The assumption that the demand for cyber operations is inelastic, for instance, is critical yet unverified.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This paper cannot, and does not, definitively contend that outsourcing is in fact on the decline. Instead, it is intended to caution against overreliance on untested assumptions about what states are doing and why they do it.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 32)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'If interest in completing operational objectives through cyber has been consistent since 2014, more insourcing would imply less outsourcing. This is unfortunately untestable.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 31)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 5: Potential Bias in Data Collection</h3>\r\n  <p>The criteria for including cases in the datasets used may introduce bias, as they rely heavily on victim transparency and observer beliefs. This affects the reliability and completeness of the data on cyber proxy usage.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Only in cases where the target detects an intrusion, admits to it, and alleges the involvement of a foreign state sponsor will that case will show up in open-source cyber conflict datasets.' (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'For researchers interested in studying cyber proxies, this raises a troubling prospect: the dominant explanation for why states outsource to proxies is plausible deniability, but scholars can only observe cases in which denials were not considered plausible enough to prevent attribution.'

(Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 76)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.'

This is largely due to the inherent anonymity and complexity of cyber operations, which often makes it nearly impossible to establish clear and convincing evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"It is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 95)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State does not constitute sufficient evidence that the cyber activity is attributable to that State.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 94)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: High Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n  <p>The authors highlight the stringent evidentiary standards required by international courts, which pose a significant challenge in cases involving cyber-attacks. The need for clear and convincing evidence is often unattainable without direct proof, which is rarely available in cyber contexts.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The ICJ demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 95)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 96)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Limited Use of Court-Appointed Experts</h3>\r\n  <p>The document notes the reluctance of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to make extensive use of court-appointed experts, which could be crucial in handling the technical aspects of cyber cases. This limitation hinders the court's ability to fully grasp the complexities involved in such cases.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The ICJ and its predecessor have been reluctant to use their powers under Article 50. Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 104)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine but also within the Court.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 104)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Dependence on Circumstantial Evidence</h3>\r\n  <p>Another limitation discussed is the heavy reliance on circumstantial evidence in proving state responsibility for cyber-attacks. The lack of direct evidence often forces reliance on circumstantial proof, which may not always meet the high standards required by the ICJ.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 95)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The proof provided must leave no room for reasonable doubt.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 96)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 5: Challenges in Lowering Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n  <p>The paper discusses the challenge of advocating for lower evidentiary standards to accommodate the unique nature of cyber-attacks. Such changes are difficult to implement and are met with significant resistance in the international legal community.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 76)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"However, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court’s involvement.\" (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, and Tiittala, 2019, p. 102)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It highlights that this assumption may be misplaced and requires further empirical validation.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“This potential for observational equivalence is all the more reason why we should be cautious before uncritically adopting the ‘plausible deniability’ assumption.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 31)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“Despite its status as a widely assumed causal mechanism, deniability for proxies may not be very plausible, after all.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 3: Limited Scope of Formal Model</h3>\r\n    <p>The formal model used in the study is noted to be an initial step towards understanding cyber proxy dynamics, but it does not capture all the complexities of real-world cyber conflicts. The model's assumptions may limit its applicability to diverse scenarios.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Formal models are not empirical tools per se, but they do allow researchers to understand how data-generating processes may work ‘under the hood’ in cases where data are questionable or unavailable.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 14)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The model holds these widely established principal-agent problems constant at their ideal, setting them aside so that other mechanisms can be studied under controlled conditions.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 15)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 4: Uncertainty in Attribution and Its Impact</h3>\r\n    <p>The study underscores the uncertainty involved in attributing cyberattacks to specific state actors, which complicates the analysis of outsourcing decisions. This uncertainty affects the robustness of the study's conclusions.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Political attribution, αv > 1, is determined by the target state’s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The knowledge that one could be held accountable, whether publicly or privately, removes the incentives to outsource, especially when proxies are unsophisticated, careless, inefficient, lack fidelity to the cause, or have their own ulterior agenda.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 23)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The study notes the difficulty in differentiating between insourced and outsourced cyber operations based on available open-source data.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“The crux of the problem is thus. Assume outsourcing bestows plausible deniability by making attribution harder, and that plausible deniability is something states desire. If outsourcing is on the rise as is commonly assumed, it follows that we should actually record fewer cases in the data over time, not more, because attributions will seem incredible.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 6)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“There is no direct way to adjudicate between these processes with the available open-source data.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 6)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Gap 2: Incomplete Data on Cyber Proxy Relationships</h4>\r\n    <p>The study identifies a gap in the completeness of data on cyber proxy relationships, particularly noting that existing datasets often do not track the termination of proxy relationships, which limits the understanding of trends over time.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Akoto [33] tracks onset of known proxy relationships only, not termination, and so cannot be used to test for a decline.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 25)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“For researchers interested in studying cyber proxies, this raises a troubling prospect: the dominant explanation for why states outsource to proxies is plausible deniability, but scholars can only observe cases in which denials were not considered plausible enough to prevent attribution.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 6)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Gap 3: Assumptions on Plausible Deniability</h4>\r\n    <p>The study points out the need for further empirical validation of the assumptions regarding the effectiveness of plausible deniability in cyber operations. This gap highlights the necessity for more nuanced and detailed data to validate these assumptions.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Despite its status as a widely assumed causal mechanism, deniability for proxies may not be very plausible, after all.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“This potential for observational equivalence is all the more reason why we should be cautious before uncritically adopting the ‘plausible deniability’ assumption.” (Canfil, 2020, p. 31)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n    <h4>Direction 1: Enhanced Data Collection and Analysis</h4>\r\n    <p>Future research should focus on improving data collection methods to better differentiate between insourced and outsourced cyber operations, potentially by developing new datasets or enhancing existing ones.</p>\r\n    <li>How can new data collection methods be developed to accurately differentiate between insourced and outsourced cyber operations?</li>\r\n    <li>What are the best practices for enhancing existing datasets to include more comprehensive tracking of cyber proxy relationships?</li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Direction 2: Empirical Validation of Plausible Deniability</h4>\r\n    <p>There is a need for studies that empirically validate the assumptions surrounding plausible deniability in cyber operations, using more nuanced and detailed data to assess the effectiveness of this strategy.</p>\r\n    <li>What empirical methods can be employed to validate the effectiveness of plausible deniability in cyber operations?</li>\r\n    <li>How does the involvement of non-state actors impact the credibility and effectiveness of plausible deniability strategies?</li>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Direction 3: Longitudinal Studies on Cyber Proxy Trends</h4>\r\n    <p>Conducting longitudinal studies that track the initiation and termination of cyber proxy relationships over time would provide deeper insights into the dynamics and trends in the use of proxies in cyber operations.</p>\r\n    <li>What are the long-term trends in the initiation and termination of cyber proxy relationships?</li>\r\n    <li>How do changes in geopolitical contexts influence the use and management of cyber proxies?</li>\r\n</div>"

(Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 75)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an indication which government was behind the attack.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 95)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 2: Need for Adaptation of Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n  <p>The authors argue for the adaptation of evidentiary standards by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to effectively handle cyber-attacks, proposing the possibility of shifting the burden of proof or lowering the evidentiary standard.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court.'

(Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 75)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 105)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 4: High Threshold for Proving Cyber-Attacks as Use of Force</h3>\r\n  <p>The authors conclude that there is a high threshold for proving cyber-attacks as a use of force under international law, noting that damage must be severe to meet this standard.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 92)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 92)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 5: Evidentiary Standards for Cyber-Attacks</h3>\r\n  <p>The study identifies three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ with corresponding evidentiary standards: regular cases requiring clear and convincing evidence, cases of exceptional gravity requiring full conviction, and cases relying on circumstantial evidence requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.'

This issue is a fundamental limitation in addressing state responsibility in cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 75)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an indication which government was behind the attack.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 95)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: High Standard of Proof</h3>\r\n  <p>The authors acknowledge the high standard of proof required by the ICJ in cases involving cyber-attacks, which makes it challenging to establish state responsibility. This limitation is significant as it affects the ability to successfully attribute and prosecute cyber-attacks under current international law frameworks.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 97)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'In Armed Activities and Oil Platforms, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 97)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Limited Use of Experts by ICJ</h3>\r\n  <p>The reluctance of the ICJ to use its powers to appoint experts in cases involving complex technical issues is highlighted as a limitation. This reluctance can hinder the effective resolution of disputes that require specialized knowledge, particularly in the context of cyber-attacks.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'So far, the ICJ and its predecessor have been reluctant to use their powers under Article 50. Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 104)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 104)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Challenges in Evidence Collection</h3>\r\n  <p>The difficulty in collecting direct evidence for cyber-attacks due to technical and political barriers is another significant limitation discussed in the paper. This limitation is exacerbated by the high evidentiary standards and the need to protect sensitive information.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'However, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 97)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack.' (Brunner, Dobrić, Pirker, Tiittala, 2019, p. 97)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The covert nature and technical complexities of cyber operations pose a major challenge in establishing accountability and legality under international law.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attribution remains a core challenge in cyberspace operations, often leading to significant delays and uncertainty in state responses.' (Vincent L. DeFabo, 2021, p. 210)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Gap in Legal Consensus on Use of Force</h4>\r\n  <p>There is a lack of consensus on whether and how existing international laws on the use of force apply to cyber operations. This gap complicates the development of coherent legal frameworks and state practices in cyberspace.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'International law currently lacks a unified stance on whether cyber operations constitute a use of force, leading to varied interpretations and implementations by states.' (Vincent L. DeFabo, 2021, p. 215)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Gap in Effects-Based Analysis Models</h4>\r\n  <p>The study highlights the need for more robust and empirical effects-based analysis models to predict and evaluate the impact of cyber operations. Current models are largely speculative and insufficiently grounded in practical scenarios.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Current effects-based analysis models are largely speculative and fail to adequately account for the real-world impacts of cyber operations.' (Vincent L. DeFabo, 2021, p. 225)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n  <h4>Development of Advanced Attribution Technologies</h4>\r\n  <p>Future research should focus on developing advanced technologies and methodologies for the precise attribution of cyber operations. These technologies should aim to reduce uncertainty and enhance the accuracy of identifying perpetrators.</p>\r\n  <li>How can emerging technologies improve the attribution accuracy of cyber operations?</li>\r\n  <blockquote>'Advances in forensic and tracking technologies are crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of attributing cyber operations to specific actors.' (Vincent L. DeFabo, 2021, p. 235)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Formulation of International Legal Standards</h4>\r\n  <p>Research should aim to establish international legal standards and consensus on the classification and handling of cyber operations as potential uses of force. This would involve multilateral discussions and agreements among states.</p>\r\n  <li>What international legal standards are necessary to effectively govern the use of force in cyberspace?</li>\r\n  <blockquote>'There is a pressing need for international legal standards that clearly define the conditions under which cyber operations may be considered uses of force.' (Vincent L. DeFabo, 2021, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Empirical Validation of Effects-Based Models</h4>\r\n  <p>Future studies should focus on empirically validating effects-based models through real-world data and scenarios. This would enhance the predictive power and reliability of these models in assessing the impacts of cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <li>How can empirical data be used to validate and improve effects-based models for cyber operations?</li>\r\n  <blockquote>'Empirical validation of effects-based models through real-world scenarios is essential for enhancing their predictive accuracy and practical relevance.'

The analysis categorizes different types of indirect evidence that can be used to reliably establish attribution in international relations.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.'

The conflict provides multiple examples of indirect evidence such as coordination, preparedness, state relations with hacker communities, and state cyber-security conception.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The Russian-Georgian war was a typical example of the high degree of care with which cyber-attacks are usually prepared and of the timing and coordination of cyber and kinetic operations.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 36)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'This particular case study was chosen because it provides one of the richest arrays of indirect evidence of various kinds, illustrating the flexibility of this form of proof in comparison to investigating cyber-attacks solely with a focus on direct evidence.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 4: Timing and coordination are key indicators of state involvement</h3>\r\n    <p>The timing and coordination of cyber-attacks with conventional military operations are significant indicators of state involvement. The study highlights how well-coordinated attacks can supplement ground operations and provide strategic advantages.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The more the attack’s timing is orchestrated and the more it appears to be well-coordinated overall, the higher the probability of a state’s involvement.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The cyber-attacks of the largest scale commenced at the same time that the Russian military began its operations, and they ended just a while after the Russians accomplished the aims of their campaign.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 38)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 5: State relations with national hacker communities can be telling</h3>\r\n    <p>The relationship between a state and its national hacker community can serve as indirect evidence of state responsibility for cyber-attacks. The study discusses Russia’s reliance on cyber-crime structures and youth organizations with IT skills to conduct cyber operations.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The relations between the government of the suspected state and the national hacker community represents the third possible type of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks to states.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 40)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Russia is traditionally known for its distinctive features of a huge reliance on cyber-crime structures, such as the aforementioned RBN, and technologically educated individuals from youth organisations such as Nashi.'

This exploratory study lays the groundwork for further investigations into indirect evidence.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic.' (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 36)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic.'

This narrow scope restricts the ability to apply the categorization of indirect evidence to other contexts and cases of cyber-attacks.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“Adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 2: Lack of Direct Evidence</h3>\r\n    <p>The study highlights the absence of direct evidence to support the attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks, relying primarily on indirect evidence. This limitation affects the conclusiveness and the strength of the arguments presented.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“On the one hand, the Russian government and officials have officially denied any engagement in the cyber-attacks and there is no first-hand evidence proving their involvement.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The chance that direct evidence would be uncovered to establish state responsibility in this case is marginal, as it is in the majority of similar cases.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 36)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 3: Dependency on Existing Theoretical Frameworks</h3>\r\n    <p>The research is heavily dependent on existing theoretical frameworks such as the overall control doctrine. This reliance may limit the study’s ability to explore alternative frameworks or propose new theoretical approaches to the issue of cyber-attack attribution.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“The article works with the international legal concepts of attribution and state responsibility and transfers them into an analysis of international relations.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 4: Reliance on Indirect Evidence Categories</h3>\r\n    <p>The categorization of indirect evidence provided by the study is not exhaustive and may not cover all relevant types of indirect evidence. The study itself suggests the need for future research to expand and refine these categories.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 5: Temporal Gap in Case Study</h3>\r\n    <p>The study's primary case study, the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008, is a decade old. This temporal gap may affect the relevance of the findings to more current cyber-attacks, which could involve different tactics, technologies, and geopolitical contexts.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Although that case is a decade old, it is an example which involved the richest variety of indirect evidence of different kinds given that the cyber campaign accompanied military attacks on ground and thus served as a force multiplier.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 36)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The lapse of time between the campaign itself and the publication of this article, there is a sufficient number of quality sources for the discussion, as other potential cases for a study of this sort such as the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids would not provide such an advantage.” (Kadlecová, 2018, p. 36)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

But it could also jeopardize the political fortunes of Americious’s leadership, who, in the aftermath of such an attack, would face the inevitable second-guessing of why they had failed to brief more companies.” (Andrew Grotto, 2020, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Ambiguity in Strategic Attribution Decisions</h3>\r\n  <p>There is an inherent ambiguity in the strategic attribution decisions, where the line between analytical judgment and strategic action can become blurred, leading to potential misinterpretations and misuse of attributions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“Strategic attribution, in contrast, pertains to what the analyst does with the analytic attribution, which includes keeping the judgment private, disclosing it to selected third parties, or making it public.” (Andrew Grotto, 2020, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“Decisions about strategic attribution are guided by political and economic factors pertaining to which mode of strategic attribution most advances the decision maker’s interests.” (Andrew Grotto, 2020, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Potential Bias in Public Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>Public attribution decisions can be biased by political or economic interests, which may lead to selective disclosure and manipulation of information for strategic purposes, potentially undermining the credibility and objectivity of the attributions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“Public attribution reflects a judgment by an entity that the benefits of public disclosure outweigh the balance of benefits and costs associated with selective or private attribution.” (Andrew Grotto, 2020, p. 9)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“On the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion.” (Andrew Grotto, 2020, p. 10)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This gap complicates the determination of state responsibility for cyber proxy actions and the subsequent legal responses available to victim states.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules and the difficulty of factually establishing the nature of the relationship between the proxy and the state.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Complicating matters is the absence of any agreed-upon evidentiary threshold for attribution (unless the case is before a court), disagreement as to whether reasonable but mistaken attribution renders a countermeasure unlawful, and the fact that international law does not require states to produce the evidence upon which they base attribution.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 22)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Gap 2: Uncertainty in the Permissibility of Collective Countermeasures</h4>\r\n  <p>There is a notable gap in the clarity regarding the permissibility of collective countermeasures under international law. This lack of clarity affects how states can collaborate in response to proxy cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The most significant unsettled issue is whether collective countermeasures are permissible, much like the UN Charter and customary law permit collective defense in response to an armed attack.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 25)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"States are split (or non-committal) on the issue. For instance, Estonia takes the position, understandably in light of its vulnerability to hostile cyber operations by Russia and its proxies, that it may seek help from other states in taking countermeasures; NATO-ally France takes the opposite position.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 25)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Gap 3: Limited State Practice and Statements on International Law in Cyber Context</h4>\r\n  <p>The document identifies a gap in state practice and formal statements regarding how international law applies to proxy cyber operations. This gap leads to uncertainty in the legal framework governing responses to these operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>\"Over time, state practice in dealing with proxy cyber operations combined with statements from states regarding how they interpret the relevant international law will yield greater clarity on the options available to defeat and deter hostile proxy cyber operations.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 30)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\"The critical point to grasp is that the international law governing response options is often permissive in terms of allowing responses, but at the same time, can be very nuanced and even unsettled.\" (Johnson & Schmitt, 2021, p. 30)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n  <h4>Direction 1: Establishing Clear Attribution Standards</h4>\r\n  <p>Future research should focus on establishing clear and universally accepted standards for the legal attribution of cyber operations to states. This would help in accurately determining state responsibility and formulating appropriate legal responses.</p>\r\n  <li>What are the most effective criteria for attributing cyber operations to state actors?</li>\r\n  <li>How can the international community reach a consensus on these attribution standards?</li>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Direction 2: Clarifying Legal Framework for Collective Countermeasures</h4>\r\n  <p>Research should aim to clarify the legal framework governing the permissibility of collective countermeasures in response to proxy cyber operations, providing guidelines for international cooperation in cyber defense.</p>\r\n  <li>Under what conditions should collective countermeasures be considered lawful?</li>\r\n  <li>What mechanisms can be developed to facilitate international cooperation in cyber defense?</li>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Direction 3: Documenting and Analyzing State Practice and Statements</h4>\r\n  <p>Further studies should document and analyze state practice and formal statements regarding the application of international law to proxy cyber operations, contributing to a more consistent and predictable legal framework.</p>\r\n  <li>How have different states interpreted and applied international law to proxy cyber operations?</li>\r\n  <li>What trends can be observed in state practice and formal statements on this issue?</li>\r\n</div>"

By presenting detailed evidence, there is a danger that adversaries could gain insight into U.S. intelligence capabilities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“While criminal charges often present detailed evidence gathered on hackers, going as far to present their photos, internet searches, and chat messages to superiors, disclosing such information can provide information about U.S. intelligence collection capabilities to adversaries.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 531)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“Prosecutors must strike a balance on what to disclose and how quickly they do so without compromising ongoing intelligence sources and methods.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 531)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: Risk of Adversary Response in Kind or Escalation</h3>\r\n  <p>Bringing charges against foreign military and intelligence officers could provoke reciprocal actions from adversary nations, potentially leading to the prosecution of U.S. government personnel abroad.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“Bringing charges against individual officers in foreign adversaries' militaries and intelligence agencies raises the potential for those countries to charge members of the U.S. government with similar offenses.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 531)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“Given that U.S. adversaries routinely violate human rights and their civil liberties protections range from few to none, U.S. hackers have voiced worries that facing criminal sentences in Beijing would be worse than facing charges in Pittsburgh.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 531)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Potential for Declining Impact on Adversary Behavior</h3>\r\n  <p>As the frequency of criminal charges increases, particularly against states that are less influenced by international condemnation, the effectiveness of these charges in altering adversary behavior might diminish.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“As the number of criminal charges increases, particularly against revisionist states like Russia that brush off international opprobrium, criminal charges may prove less viable for certain purposes, especially those related to exerting pressure on adversary governments.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“If criminal charges do not lead to definite changes in behavior or clear costs on individual hackers, their perceived signaling strength to external audiences could erode.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Time Required to Assemble Criminal Charges</h3>\r\n  <p>The process of investigating, gathering evidence, and bringing criminal charges can be slow, often lagging significantly behind the malicious activities they address, which may reduce their deterrent effect.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“Malicious activity, particularly that which has an immediate public impact like the 2011-2013 DDoS attacks or the 2016 hack of the DNC, creates pressure on the U.S. government to respond quickly. Criminal charges are often a poor solution to this problem because it takes time to investigate, compile rigorous evidence, and then convince a grand jury to approve the criminal charge.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“One indictment unsealed in 2018 referenced malicious activity from 2011 through 2015. It took Justice Department prosecutors until summer 2018 to unseal charges against GRU officers for hacking the DNC in 2016.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 5: Failure to Indict Could Imply Tacit Toleration of Malicious Activity</h3>\r\n  <p>Not bringing indictments in response to state-sponsored hacking could be interpreted as tacit acceptance of such activities, undermining the deterrent effect of previous charges.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>“Justice Department officials have commented that if they did not indict state-sponsored hackers, they would be sending a message to hackers that they could act with impunity.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>“As criminal charges have become a routine feature of U.S. responses to state-sponsored cyber activity, the risk has become that in cases where the U.S. does not unseal an indictment, it signals that it tacitly accepts that activity as permissible.” (Hinck & Maurer, 2019, p. 533)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The study identifies that improving technical and legal attribution will not affect certain groups of cyber criminals, particularly those who are already skilled in evading such measures.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Improving technical attribution will not affect population B, as it is unlikely that they would consider further how to evade new techniques (current ones being already sufficient).' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1040)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Similarly, improving legal mechanisms for attribution is also unlikely to encourage users of population B to use more advance techniques to evade attribution.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1040)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 2: Cyber criminals seek peer recognition rather than fearing state punishment.</h3>\r\n    <p>The study also concludes that for many cyber criminals, the desire for recognition among peers outweighs the fear of state-imposed punishments. This is particularly true for those who are part of a subculture that values technical prowess and visibility over anonymity and security from legal repercussions.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Hackers as part of a subculture, seek recognition through claiming attacks. The recognition they seek does not involve receiving a punishment by the state, but recognition by their peers still trumps the potentiality of being punished by claiming their actions.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1040)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Interestingly, criminals claimed breaches more when they succeeded in stealing information from the victims rather than money.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1040)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 3: Media reporting influences the perception of attribution and deterrence.</h3>\r\n    <p>The perception of the likelihood of being caught, influenced by media reports, plays a significant role in the deterrence of cyber crimes. The study shows that the number of media reports discussing the lack of attribution correlates with an increase in cyber attacks, suggesting that media coverage can either encourage or deter cybercriminal activities depending on the narrative.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The rate of articles published by newspapers and showing a lack of attribution over the course of eight years is positively related to the number of attacks (0.01-threshold).' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1039)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'This means that if the perception of likeliness of the lack of attribution decreases (through media reporting more than the police catching cyber criminals, or media reporting that the police caught more cyber criminals), then the number of cyber attacks decreases.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1039)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 4: Different populations of cyber criminals react differently to attribution.</h3>\r\n    <p>The study categorizes cyber criminals into different populations based on their reactions to attribution mechanisms. For instance, population A-1 acts despite knowing about attribution due to emotional impulses or a desire for recognition, while population A-2 is deterred by the knowledge of attribution. Population B, however, is not influenced by improvements in attribution techniques due to their existing capabilities to evade such measures.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'To summarize, I identified three populations of cyber criminals. The first one regroups individuals who know about attribution but still act (population A-1).' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1042)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Of the three categories, this research has shown that enhancing attribution can only work as a deterrent for population A-2.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1042)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 5: Attribution alone is insufficient as a deterrent strategy.</h3>\r\n    <p>The research suggests that relying solely on attribution to deter cyber crimes is ineffective. Other policies and measures need to be implemented to address cyber criminality comprehensively, as enhancing attribution mechanisms alone fails to deter all types of cyber criminals effectively.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Enhancing attribution mechanisms simply for deterrent purposes is likely to fail for other types of criminals.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1031)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'States need therefore to apply different policy to curb cyber crimes than solely based on deterrence.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1031)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

(Guitton, 2012, p. 1032)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Even in cases where they would act under reason, the limited information they may have to weigh their decision (e.g. their knowledge of the law), and other limited resources bounds the rationality of the decision.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1032)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 2: Displacement of cybercrime</h3>\r\n    <p>The research points out that enhancing attribution mechanisms may lead to the displacement of cybercrime rather than its reduction. Cyber criminals might route their traffic through countries that do not criminalize cyber attacks or do not cooperate with foreign law enforcement agencies.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'One of the further measure he could take is for instance to route his traffic via a country which does not criminalize cyber attacks, or which does not cooperate with foreign law enforcement agencies.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1032)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The consequence of such a routing is for the investigative party to notice an apparent, albeit not real, displacement of the source of the crime.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1032)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 3: Media influence on the perception of attribution</h3>\r\n    <p>The study highlights a methodological constraint related to media influence on the perception of attribution. The reliance on media reports to measure the perception of attribution may not accurately reflect the actual likelihood of attribution.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'By basing their research solely on publicly known breaches, the researchers face an important methodological constraint, also limiting the application of their results.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1033)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Media outlets are an important source of influence, and focusing on the media is as such logical as well.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1033)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 4: Generalization issues from a small sample size</h3>\r\n    <p>The empirical data used in the study are derived from a limited number of cases across a few countries, which may not be representative of broader trends in cybercriminal behavior.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'They based their research on 49 cases spanning eight countries.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1033)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Further research is hence necessary to support the significance of Png and Wang’s findings.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1033)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Shortcoming 5: Limited scope of policy recommendations</h3>\r\n    <p>The study's policy recommendations are constrained by the specific populations examined, limiting the generalizability of the suggested measures to broader contexts.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'It implies that a deterrent strategy for cyber crime must heed other elements than simply trying to enhance attribution capabilities, although other policy can be challenging to implement.' (Guitton, 2012, p. 1042)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'States need therefore to apply different policy to curb cyber crimes than solely based on deterrence.'

This need is critical for establishing norms and enhancing the ability to hold states accountable for cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'States should work toward norms of expected conduct in cyberspace, along with mutually agreed deterrents to harmful cyber intrusions.

This gap in international law makes it challenging to hold states accountable for cyber actions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Recognizing that customary international law has not developed a set of understandings or recognized State practice on what level of attribution is acceptable or necessary for establishing State responsibility for cyber actions, the IGE concluded that \"States may agree between themselves to a rule of responsibility specific to a cyber act or practice.\"' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The international-law reasonableness approach and the absence of burdens or criteria for assessing attribution leave an unfortunate gap in the international law of cyber.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: Challenges in attribution due to technical complexities</h3>\r\n  <p>The complexity of the technical environment poses significant challenges to accurate attribution. The dynamic nature of cyber operations means that new tools constantly emerge, both improving and complicating attribution efforts.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'States are better able to attribute cyber intrusions than they were a decade ago, but the technical environment is so dynamic that new tools constantly both improve and occlude attribution capabilities.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attribution judgments draw on many different sources of information, which has one major temporal implication—early judgments made with less information are generally less believable than later judgments made with more information.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Insufficient state transparency and cooperation</h3>\r\n  <p>The lack of transparency and cooperation among states regarding attribution and state responsibility in cyberspace is highlighted as a critical limitation. This secrecy undermines efforts to develop robust international norms and enforce state accountability.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The highly classified nature of such attribution assessments is the primary reason for the absence of customary international law on this important point.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Without more public accounting of State responsibility, governments and citizens are not likely to trust or accept cyber responses, leading to the escalation of cyber conflict and failures of deterrence.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Inadequate responses to cyber intrusions below the use-of-force threshold</h3>\r\n  <p>The paper discusses the inadequacy of international legal frameworks in providing effective responses to cyber intrusions that do not reach the use-of-force threshold. This limitation hinders the development of effective deterrence measures.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'International law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Tallinn 2.0 and its near-contemporaneous release with the U.S. response to the Russian DNC hack bring into sharp relief the fact that international law on State responsibility for cyber operations and their attribution fails to provide prescriptive norms that will help deter malicious cyber operations.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 5: Potential bias and limitations of private-sector firms in attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>The reliance on private-sector firms for attribution judgments introduces potential biases and limitations. These firms may lack the independence and comprehensive intelligence capabilities necessary for reliable state attribution.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Private firms' cases for attribution of State responsibility are speculative. They can provide computer forensics and, at times, identify the operators of perpetrator machines. But they lack the authority and means to collect the human intelligence necessary to reliably find State attribution.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'There is a big difference between saying that Russians hacked and Russia hacked. In addition, the companies have a self-interested stake in marketing their brand and encouraging further work on Internet security. The companies may lack the independence and rigor that we expect of government intelligence work.' (Banks, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n</div>"

(Chircop, 2018, p. 645)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attribution is predicated on the nexus between an actor and a State, [but] the mere fact that a cyber operation is carried out on a State’s territory, or from a State’s governmental cyber infrastructure, is insufficient to attribute the operation to that State.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 645)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 2: Adoption of Due Diligence as a Standard</h3>\r\n  <p>The due diligence principle can address the shortcomings of the existing attribution framework by holding states responsible for cyber operations that originate from their territories if they fail to take reasonable measures to prevent them.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Due diligence offers a suitable standard of attribution that can rectify [the current framework's] limitations.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The principle overcomes concerns of indeterminate liability because of its clearly and carefully defined scope: States assume responsibility only for unlawful conduct carried out from within their territory that they have knowledge of and the capacity to respond to.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 3: Challenges to Implementing Due Diligence</h3>\r\n  <p>Implementing the due diligence standard in international law faces challenges, including the need for states to monitor cyber activities effectively and the potential resistance from states due to the increased responsibility and resource requirements.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The effective operation of international law in cyberspace is not a given. Considerable State-based and scholarly efforts to apply international law principles to the cyber context have not yielded encouraging practical outcomes.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'States are presumed to act in accordance with their international legal obligations. What might, at first glance, appear to be a State-sponsored cyber operation could in fact be the work of a patriotic (but non-State) hacker.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 646)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 4: Role of International Courts</h3>\r\n  <p>International courts have shown a willingness to consider new standards of attribution, as demonstrated in the ICJ’s Corfu Channel and Armed Activities decisions, which could be pivotal for the acceptance of the due diligence principle.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court’s willingness to accept new standards of attribution in appropriate circumstances is particularly instructive. It has done so on at least two occasions, in its Corfu Channel and Armed Activities decisions.' (Chircop, 2018, p. 659)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'International courts have repeatedly engaged with novel arguments concerning the State responsibility framework.'

What appears to make adverse cyber operations so inviting is, for technical reasons, such operations are extremely difficult—if even possible—to attribute to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 431)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In short, it is still nearly impossible to trace a cyber operation with absolute certainty to a particular computer system and, more importantly, to its author.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 438)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 2: Evidentiary Standards in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n    <p>The study underscores the high evidentiary standards required for attributing cyber operations to a state, emphasizing the role of indirect evidence and the complexities involved in meeting these standards.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'In many, if not most cases, the standard of proof will be convincing evidence, a rather high standard of proof. This standard does not rule out the consideration of indirect evidence.'

(Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 453)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 3: Due Diligence Obligations of States</h3>\r\n    <p>The research concludes that states have due diligence obligations to prevent adverse cyber operations originating from their territory. Failure to fulfill these obligations can lead to state responsibility.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'We argue that, with regard to adverse cyber operations, causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also, and decisively, informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin, that is, the State from whose territory the adverse cyber operation originates.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 431)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'If the victim-State is able to present evidence tracing the adverse cyber operation to a State IT system, it can be reasonably inferred that a State organ initiated the operation. Once established, the State of origin may then prove the negative fact that a State organ had not authored the operation.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 465)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 4: The Role of Countermeasures and Self-Defense</h3>\r\n    <p>The authors discuss the rights of victim-states to take countermeasures or act in self-defense against states responsible for adverse cyber operations, contingent on the attribution of such operations.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'In responding to adverse cyber operations, victim-States may have recourse to their right to act in self-defense or to take countermeasures. Both acts in self-defense and countermeasures may be directed, however, only against such States of origin as are internationally responsible for the particular cyber operation.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 464)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The victim-State bears the burden of proof for those facts that, if true, establish that the operation was caused (1) by conduct (2) of a person, group of persons, or entity (3) attributable to the State of origin.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 465)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Finding 5: The Sliding Scale of Proof</h3>\r\n    <p>The study proposes a sliding scale for the standard of proof based on the gravity of the alleged breach of international law, with higher standards for more severe breaches.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The question of whether evidence gathered and submitted by the victim-State is sufficient to discharge its burden of proof is decided in light of the applicable standard of proof. The standard of proof applies as a function of the gravity of the alleged breach of international law.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 465)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The highest standard, requiring “fully conclusive evidence,” would apply to breaches of exceptional gravity. Continuing down the scale, the next standard, “conclusive” or “convincing evidence,” would apply when the charges are of substantial but lesser gravity.' (Dederer & Singer, 2019, p. 444)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ accepted circumstantial evidence to hold Albania legally responsible, while in the Crime of Genocide case, the Court did not find similar evidence sufficient to hold Serbia accountable.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court found circumstantial evidence from the UK reliable enough to hold Albania legally responsible, but did not find Bosnia's circumstantial evidence reliable enough to decide that Serbia intended to commit genocide.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 142)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Crime of Genocide decision is similar to Corfu Channel in that, in both cases, the Court permitted a party to keep evidence secret, but it is different in that, in Crime of Genocide, the Court relied far less on circumstantial evidence to reach its legal conclusions.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 142)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 2: The Need for a More Coherent Approach</h3>\r\n  <p>The authors argue for a more coherent approach to handling circumstantial evidence and adverse inferences by the ICJ to ensure fairness and consistency in international jurisprudence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'By carefully examining the treatment of evidence exclusively accessible by one party in these and other international cases, this Article seeks, first, to illuminate the nuances in the Court's approach to circumstantial evidence and adverse inferences and, second, to recommend a more coherent approach for the future.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 123)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'This Article concludes by providing recommendations for approaching the issue in the future.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 126)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 3: Influence of ICJ Decisions on International and Domestic Law</h3>\r\n  <p>The findings indicate that ICJ decisions significantly impact international practice and are frequently cited as authoritative in national courts.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Because International Court of Justice cases have significant impact on the practice of states and international organizations and are frequently cited as authority by national courts, a better understanding of the Court's application of evidentiary standards has broad scholarly and practical utility.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 123)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Although ICJ cases are binding only on the parties to the particular dispute, and thus do not statutorily have precedential value, the Court, other international bodies, and domestic courts frequently cite and heavily rely on past ICJ cases.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 127)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 4: Challenges in Proving Specific Intent</h3>\r\n  <p>The study highlights the difficulty in proving the specific intent required for the crime of genocide through circumstantial evidence, as demonstrated in the ICJ's ruling in the Crime of Genocide case.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court did not find direct evidence to support Bosnia's submission that the pattern shown by circumstantial evidence proved that Serbia had intent to commit acts of genocide.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Using circumstantial evidence to prove specific intent of high-level government officials is particularly difficult in that the Court requires the intent to be \"convincingly shown.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Finding 5: Flexibility in Admissibility of Evidence</h3>\r\n  <p>The ICJ has maintained a flexible approach to the admissibility of evidence, evaluating the authenticity, reliability, and persuasiveness of materials submitted by the parties, though this flexibility is sometimes inconsistently applied.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Over the years, the ICJ has taken a flexible approach to the admissibility of evidence. The Court evaluates the authenticity, reliability, and persuasiveness of the materials submitted by the parties.'

This results in the Court often relying on whatever evidence is voluntarily submitted by the parties, which may be incomplete or biased.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Nevertheless, by tradition, the ICJ has relied principally on the parties to a case for production of evidence, and since the parties are sovereign states, the Court does not have the power to compel them to produce evidence.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 127)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court may only have before it circumstantial evidence of a claim or may be confined to limited direct evidence.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 149)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: Inconsistent Application of Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n  <p>The study notes that the ICJ has inconsistently applied its standards for circumstantial evidence across different cases, which undermines the predictability and reliability of its judgments.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court's treatments of circumstantial evidence in the Corfu Channel and Crime of Genocide cases seem partially incompatible.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 139)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'At first glance, it may appear that the ICJ radically changed its treatment of circumstantial evidence in Crime of Genocide from its earlier approach in Corfu Channel.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 126)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: Difficulty in Proving Specific Intent with Circumstantial Evidence</h3>\r\n  <p>Proving specific intent, particularly for crimes like genocide, through circumstantial evidence alone is challenging, and the ICJ often finds such evidence insufficient.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court did not find direct evidence to support Bosnia's submission that the pattern shown by circumstantial evidence proved that Serbia had intent to commit acts of genocide.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Using circumstantial evidence to prove specific intent of high-level government officials is particularly difficult in that the Court requires the intent to be \"convincingly shown.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Reliance on Judicial Notice and Public Knowledge</h3>\r\n  <p>The ICJ's reliance on judicial notice and public knowledge for circumstantial evidence can be problematic, as these sources may not always be reliable or sufficiently detailed.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Judge Lauterpacht cited the Court's reliance on circumstantial evidence in Corfu Channel when discussing the question of the complicity of Serbia in assisting the Bosnian Serb forces in Bosnia.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'He found that the circumstantial evidence comported with the primary evidence, and he found it notable that Serbia did not rebut any of Bosnia's circumstantial evidence.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 5: Limited Evidentiary Impact from ICTY Findings</h3>\r\n  <p>Despite recognizing the ICTY's rigorous fact-finding processes, the ICJ does not always give full weight to ICTY findings, which can limit the evidentiary impact of these findings on ICJ decisions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court had the option to rely on multiple decisions from the ICTY. The Court determined that trial decisions by the ICTY merited special attention because the fact-finding process of the ICTY tests evidence through cross-examination.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The ICJ did not rely on all findings of the ICTY, including \"the Tribunal's use of circumstantial evidence to prove genocidal intent in the absence of smoking gun evidence of such intent.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 141)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This flexibility is crucial for the Court to adapt to the specific needs of each case.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court possesses such sweeping powers in the acceptance and evaluation of any and all forms of evidence that it is difficult to prove that it lacks power or ability a priori to cope with any given type of evidence.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court has great flexibility in determining how to handle questions of fact and evidence.' (Highet, 1987, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Indirect methods of proof are frequently utilized.</h4>\r\n  <p>The Court often relies on indirect or inferential methods of proof, especially in complex cases where direct evidence may be lacking. This approach was prominently observed in the Nicaragua case, highlighting the Court's ability to draw conclusions from a combination of public knowledge, governmental statements, and other indirect sources.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This quick overview of the factual findings made in the Nicaragua case suffices to show how substantially the Court relied upon indirect or inferential methods of proof, as well as on public knowledge supported by either governmental acknowledgments or the absence of denials.' (Highet, 1987, p. 50)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Affirmative findings concerning this subject were largely supported by reports of official government acknowledgments and discussions of the contra forces.' (Highet, 1987, p. 50)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h4>Flexibility and adaptability in procedural rules.</h4>\r\n  <p>The ICJ's procedural rules are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing the Court to respond appropriately to the unique circumstances of each case. This adaptability is evident in the Court's willingness to consider a wide range of evidentiary forms and its pragmatic approach to procedural matters.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court may at any time decide, either proprio motu or at the request of a party, to exercise its functions with regard to the obtaining of evidence at a place or locality to which the case relates, subject to such conditions as the Court may decide upon after ascertaining the views of the parties.' (Highet, 1987, p. 12)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court is always free to draw its own conclusions: sometimes ignoring factual assertions completely; sometimes finding that a point is made or established by default; sometimes seeking new evidence; sometimes accepting and sometimes excluding evidence from consideration.' (Highet, 1987, p. 15)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

                "content": "<div>\r\n  <h3>Shortcomings and Limitations</h3>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Absence of Coercive Powers</h4>\r\n  <p>One significant limitation identified in the study is the ICJ's lack of coercive powers. The Court cannot compel the production of evidence, subpoena witnesses, or punish for contempt. This restriction severely limits the Court's ability to function decisively in evidentiary matters, particularly when dealing with states that may be unwilling to cooperate fully.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The most significant impediment to the ability of the Court to function decisively in evidentiary questions is, of course, that it possesses no power to order production. It cannot subpoena witnesses or experts; it cannot punish for contempt; it has no extraterritorial power to compel the production or disclosure of documentary evidence or the taking of live testimony.' (Highet, 1987, p. 10)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court has no processes to compel the production of evidence. It may request of public international organizations information relative to cases before it, and may call upon the agents to produce any document or supply any explanation. Relevant questions may be put to witnesses and experts. But the Court must depend upon the consent of States to produce witnesses or permit the making of inquiries on the spot.' (Highet, 1987, p. 10)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Reliance on Indirect Evidence</h4>\r\n  <p>Another notable shortcoming is the Court's reliance on indirect or inferential methods of proof. While this approach can be effective in some instances, it may not always provide a robust foundation for conclusive judgments, especially in complex cases with conflicting evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This quick overview of the factual findings made in the Nicaragua case suffices to show how substantially the Court relied upon indirect or inferential methods of proof, as well as on public knowledge supported by either governmental acknowledgments or the absence of denials.' (Highet, 1987, p. 50)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Court has seen no evidence that the conduct of those States was consistent with such a situation .... [T]he representative of El Salvador before the United Nations Security Council . . . refrained from stating that El Salvador had been subjected to armed attack, and made no mention of the right of collective self-defence which it had supposedly asked the United States to exercise.' (Highet, 1987, p. 37)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Challenges with Fluid Situations</h4>\r\n  <p>The study highlights the difficulty of adjudicating \"ongoing\" or \"fluid\" factual situations, such as those involving armed conflicts. The constantly changing nature of these situations makes it challenging to establish a stable factual basis for judicial determinations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'There has been much discussion of late about what has been termed \"ongoing\" or \"fluid\" factual situations, also involving \"armed conflict.\" The assertion is made that these are inherently \"unsuitable for judicial determination,\" and that the evidence produced in connection with them is intrinsically unmanageable or inappropriate for the Court's consideration.' (Highet, 1987, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'A situation of armed conflict is not the only one in which evidence of fact may be difficult to come by, and the Court has in the past recognized and made allowance for this (Corfu Channel, I.CJ. Reports 1949, p. 18; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, I.CJ. Reports 1980, p. 10, para. 13).' (Highet, 1987, p. 43)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Procedural Flexibility</h4>\r\n  <p>While procedural flexibility is generally an advantage, it also poses limitations. The lack of stringent rules regarding evidence can lead to inconsistent practices and decisions, potentially undermining the perceived fairness and reliability of the Court's judgments.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'It became apparent early on that the Court would find it difficult, if not impossible, to assert anything approaching stringent rules relating to the substance of the evidence produced. As was pointed out above, the Court has applied practically no rules of propriety or admissibility to documentary evidence.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The basic approach has been for the Court to make relatively ad hoc determinations as to admissibility, suitability and probative value on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case and within the context and broad compass of its Statute and Rules.'

(Shrivastava, 2022)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Even if accepting this concept, and if the principle of equality of States is to remain relevant, it is more appropriate to consider practices of States that have a special legal interest in a field rather than those having the most “influence” as Stockburger suggested (p. 8).'

(Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Distinction between causality and attribution in cyber operations</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and, even more importantly, to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is, primarily, a normative issue.'

(Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'When applied to a cyber operation, the conduct complained of (e.g., launching the malware) must have been an “integral part” of the operation directed or controlled by, or carried out on the instructions of, the State.'

(Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 445)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - The highest standard of proof is required for breaches of exceptional gravity, such as genocide.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The highest standard, requiring “fully conclusive evidence,” would apply to breaches of exceptional gravity.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 444)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In cases in which the international responsibility of a party is at stake, the standard of proof depends on the nature of the international obligation allegedly breached by that party.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 444)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - The ICJ applies different standards of proof without precise definitions.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'International criminal courts strictly adhere to the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Other international courts, tribunals, and dispute settlement bodies fluctuate between different standards of proof, often without providing precise definitions of each standard or their scope of application.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 443)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Indeed, the ICJ has not articulated even a general standard of proof to be applied in cases brought before it.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 443)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 8,9 - The ICJ retains flexibility in evaluating evidence based on facts and circumstances of each case.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As a former judge and president of the ICJ states, “The Court’s prime objective as to standard of proof appears to have been to retain a freedom in evaluating the evidence, relying on the facts and circumstances of each case.”' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019, p. 443)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'This inclusivity, in turn, may contribute to a reluctance to make express reference to national concepts of standard of proof, each of which has its own legal history, doctrinal structure, and normative context.'

(Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Fully conclusive evidence is required to establish that an armed attack has occurred.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Hence, a deviation from the prohibition of the use of force would be a case of exceptional gravity warranting the highest standard of proof (fully convinced).' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Accordingly, a victim-State engaging in self-defense must have fully conclusive evidence establishing that an armed attack has occurred and that the attack is attributable to the attacking State.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Differentiating between grave and less grave forms of the use of force.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'However, with regard to the prohibition of the use of force, one must “distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms.”' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Therefore, the highest standard of proof should apply only to claims of self-defense if the measures taken in self-defense amount to the most grave forms of the use of force.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 6, 7 - The appropriate standard of proof for less grave forms of self-defense.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In case of measures taken by the victim-State against the attacker-State that are less grave forms of the use of force, conclusive or convincing evidence would be the appropriate standard of proof.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Certainly, a State that is the victim of an armed attack, which responds with measures well below the threshold of the most grave forms of the use of force, should not be expected to meet the highest standard of proof in defending the lawfulness of its action.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 8, 9 - The ICJ applies an intermediate standard of proof in self-defense cases.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Admittedly, the ICJ seems to apply an intermediate standard of proof in self-defense cases without distinction as to the gravity of the amount of force used by the victim-State.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'While expressly rejecting a “balance of evidence” test, in Oil Platforms, the Court found the evidence presented by the United States “inconclusive” regarding Iran’s responsibility for the naval mine struck by a U.S. warship or the missile attack on a U.S.-reflagged merchant vessel.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 10, 11 - The convincing evidence standard for jus ad bellum cases involving military actions.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In that same judgment, the Court indicated conclusive evidence constituted evidence that was more than merely “suggestive” or “highly suggestive.”' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'This finding is consistent with earlier statements of the Court indicating convincing evidence is the standard of proof to be applied in jus ad bellum cases involving actions taken by military forces.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 12, 13 - The application of the convincing evidence standard in cyber operations.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Hence, based on the aforementioned ICJ jurisprudence, if the victim-State of an adverse cyber operation responds with the use of force against the State of origin, it must collect, and if necessary present sufficient evidence to meet the Court’s convincing evidence standard of proof.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Thus, the evidence must convincingly establish the victim-State was, or continues to be, the object of an adverse cyber operation amounting to an armed attack that is attributable to the State of origin.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 14, 15 - The difficulties in meeting the burden of proof for self-defense claims in cyber contexts.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Of course, in some instances, it may be impossible for a State injured by an adverse cyber operation to discharge its burden of proof concerning causality and attribution.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Nevertheless, the technical and intelligence gathering complexities inherent in establishing causality and attribution in these cases do not warrant a lowering of the standard of proof generally applicable in jus ad bellum cases.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 16, 17 - Consistent application of the standard of proof regardless of the manner of injury.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Indeed, there is no persuasive argument for applying different standards of proof based on the manner in which the injury was inflicted.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In all cases, a deviation from the prohibition of the use of force based on a claim of lawful self-defense must be assessed under the same standard of proof.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 18, 19 - The requirement for conclusive evidence in jus ad bellum cases involving adverse cyber operations.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'As an example, in Oil Platforms, the ICJ required the United States—the victim-State of an armed attack—to present conclusive evidence of Iranian culpability despite the challenges for doing so.' (Hans-Georg Dederer, Tassilo Singer, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'This same standard should apply for States responding to adverse cyber operations.'

There is a large body of research on the topic of network based attribution techniques.'</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Purpose and challenges of IP traceback</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In their paper Tracking Intruders on Geographical Map Using IDS Alert, Manish Kumar, M. Hanumanthappa, and T.V. Suresh Kumar note that the purpose of network based attribution, also known as IP traceback, is to identify the true IP address of the threat actor (2012).' </blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Researcher Howard Lipson noted in Tracking and Tracing Cyber Attacks: Technical Challenges and Global Policy Issues, the difficulty of IP traceback. For example, the stated source address of a packet, in many cases, may not be accurate.'</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Stepping-stone hosts and encryption types</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Further, Lipson explained the use of stepping-stone hosts to launder traffic can obscure the true source of traffic. Directing traffic through one or more stepping-stones, the attacker can also vary encryption types, signaling, and other aspects to complicate attribution (Lipson, 2002).' </blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Researchers have proposed many different approaches to IP traceback. Literature commonly discusses five of these solutions: hash-based IP traceback, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traceback, overlay networks, packet marking, and packet timing.'</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Hash-based IP traceback</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Hash-based IP traceback. Also known as Source Path Isolation Engine (SPIE), by keeping a log in each Internet router of traffic headers or a digest of the header, a hash-based IP trackback solution would enable the tracing of traffic across the web.' </blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - ICMP traceback</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'ICMP traceback. Also known as iTrace, ICMP traceback would require the creation of a new type of ICMP message. In this scheme, one packet per 20,000 packets would trigger the creation of an iTrace packet by routers along its path through the Internet.' </blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - Overlay networks</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Overlay networks. Overlay networks, as their name implies, require the creation of a separate network to follow traffic.

                "content": "<div>\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 1 - The increasing regularity of cyber attack attribution reports</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In the world of cybersecurity, attribution is big business. Reports by security firms and researchers that attribute cyber attacks to governments, terrorist groups, or specific hacker gangs occur with increasing regularity. With varying degrees of success, experts attempt to link malware, webpage defacements, retail-chain hacks, cyber espionage, and all matter of other cyber attacks to cement their place as leaders in the cybersecurity marketplace. As noted in Techniques for Cyber Attack Attribution by David A. Wheeler and Gregory N. Larsen, in the field of cybersecurity there is no one agreed upon definition of the term attribution. For the purposes of this paper, the definition Wheeler and Larsen put forth, “determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary,” will be used (2003, p. ES-1, para. 1).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.1)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 2 - The concept of attribution in detective work and cyber investigations</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'A process of attribution is something shown in most every detective novel and crime drama. On television and in the real world, the collection of evidence serves a critical purpose, to attribute a crime to a suspect. As with a traditional investigation, the goal of cyber attribution is to narrow down a pool of suspects to identify a perpetrator; one digital fingerprint could be the key to attributing an attack. In the cyber realm, attribution often means attempting to identify who was behind the keyboard during an attack or who authored a particular piece of malware. There is also the possibility that the attackers are hired guns or sympathizers working on behalf of governments and other groups (Owens et al., 2009). Thomas Rid and Ben Buchanan note in their paper Attributing Cyber Attacks: …attribution is an art as much as a science. There is no one recipe for correct attribution, no one methodology or flow-chart or check-list. Finding the right clues requires a disciplined focus on a set of detailed questions — but also the intuition of technically experienced operators.' (2014, p. 4, para. 2) (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.2)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - The complexity and challenges of cyber attribution</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Cyber attribution is complex, and even those best suited to attempt it make mistakes. Thomas Fox-Brewster illustrates this complexity in a 2015 Forbes article. Citing a report from cybersecurity company Trend Micro, Fox-Brewster wrote that, in early 2015 authorities purportedly falsely accused a Gaza man of anti-Israeli hacking. This attack misattribution could quite plausibly put an otherwise innocent individual at risk of undue reprisal (2015). Nation-states can also be the victim of sloppy attribution. In a May 2015 blog post, noted cybersecurity researcher Brian Krebs called out a small Colorado-based cybersecurity firm that had “boasted it had thwarted plans by organized Russian cyber criminals to launch an attack against multiple US-based banks”(Krebs, 2015, \"Security Firm Redefines APT,\" para. 1). Researching further, Krebs found the activity was likely linked to “unsophisticated Nigerian phishers” (Krebs, 2015, \"Security Firm Redefines APT,\" para. 1) rather than Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.3)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Importance of precision and accuracy in cyber attribution</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'As stated in Technology, Policy, Law, and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities, published by the National Research Council (U.S.), Precision and accuracy is key. While similar concepts, precision and accuracy are different and complimentary: \r\n  - Precision. An attribution has associated with it some range of precision for the identity of the attacker. The attack might be associated with a specific nation …, a specific department within that nation ..., a specific unit …, a specific set of IP addresses, [or] a specific individual.' (Owens et al., 2009, Attribution, para. 2) (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.3-4)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'- Accuracy. A characteristic related to precision is accuracy, a measure of the quality of attribution, such as the probability that the attribution is correct. Accuracy is a key issue in legal standards for evidence and in the extent to which it is reasonable to develop linkages and inferences based on those attributes. Note that an attacker may seek to reduce the accuracy of attribution if he or she wishes to operate secretly by taking countermeasures to impersonate other parties. (Owens et al., 2009, Attribution, para. 2) In the absence of precision and accuracy, the confidence in any report attributing an attack is dubious at best.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Reasons for cyber attribution</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'While many information technology (IT) practitioners may find attribution merely an academic pursuit, there are three situations where cyber attribution is key. The first, attribution is critical in the investigation of a cyber crime by law enforcement. The very act of investigation is one of attributing crime to the perpetrator. Second, attribution is useful for national security and strategic reasons. Attribution is a critical part of deterring attacks by nation-states and others (Haley, 2013). Third and finally, attribution is critical in cases of national defense, war, or real-world retaliatory action (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, 2013). As such, law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies, and the military, respectively, have a natural interest in attribution.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - The significance of attribution in law enforcement and national security</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'A May 2014 indictment in the Western District of Pennsylvania reflected the importance of attribution to law enforcement and our national security. In a largely symbolic move, the U.S. attorney charged five Chinese nationals, linked with the Chinese government, with violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, as well as other charges for their role in computer espionage against American businesses. The indictment documents the tradecraft used by the suspects, including the creation and use of e-mail accounts to send messages with malicious attachments to specific employees at the targeted firms (Hickton, 2014). This attack method, known as spear phishing, is defined as “e-mail spoofing fraud attempt that targets a specific organization, seeking unauthorized access to confidential data” (Rouse, 2011b, spear phishing, para. 1).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - The role of attribution in military and political contexts</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In the military realm, the NATO document Tallinn Manual on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), attempts to set rules for military action in cyberspace including rules that are reliant on reliable attribution. The manual lays out rules of conduct, which require separating out non-combatants, such as civilians and journalists, from valid military targets. Among its many rules, the manual states, “during hostilities involving cyber operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, individual civilians, and civilian objects” (p. 137, para. 5). To comply with these rules, militaries need to properly attribute an attack to an adversary, as well as be able to target the infrastructure of the enemy while minimizing the impact to civilians (Schmitt & NATO, 2013).'

(Owens et al., 2009, Attribution, para. 2) (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.3-4)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Importance of accuracy in attribution</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'- Accuracy. A characteristic related to precision is accuracy, a measure of the quality of attribution, such as the probability that the attribution is correct. Accuracy is a key issue in legal standards for evidence and in the extent to which it is reasonable to develop linkages and inferences based on those attributes. Note that an attacker may seek to reduce the accuracy of attribution if he or she wishes to operate secretly by taking countermeasures to impersonate other parties. (Owens et al., 2009, Attribution, para. 2) In the absence of precision and accuracy, the confidence in any report attributing an attack is dubious at best.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Reasons for the significance of cyber attribution</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'While many information technology (IT) practitioners may find attribution merely an academic pursuit, there are three situations where cyber attribution is key. The first, attribution is critical in the investigation of a cyber crime by law enforcement. The very act of investigation is one of attributing crime to the perpetrator. Second, attribution is useful for national security and strategic reasons. Attribution is a critical part of deterring attacks by nation-states and others (Haley, 2013). Third and finally, attribution is critical in cases of national defense, war, or real-world retaliatory action (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, 2013). As such, law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies, and the military, respectively, have a natural interest in attribution.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - Symbolic and practical significance of attribution to national security</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'A May 2014 indictment in the Western District of Pennsylvania reflected the importance of attribution to law enforcement and our national security. In a largely symbolic move, the U.S. attorney charged five Chinese nationals, linked with the Chinese government, with violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, as well as other charges for their role in computer espionage against American businesses. The indictment documents the tradecraft used by the suspects, including the creation and use of e-mail accounts to send messages with malicious attachments to specific employees at the targeted firms (Hickton, 2014). This attack method, known as spear phishing, is defined as “e-mail spoofing fraud attempt that targets a specific organization, seeking unauthorized access to confidential data” (Rouse, 2011b, spear phishing, para. 1).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.4)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - Role of reliable attribution in military contexts</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In the military realm, the NATO document Tallinn Manual on The International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (2013), attempts to set rules for military action in cyberspace including rules that are reliant on reliable attribution. The manual lays out rules of conduct, which require separating out non-combatants, such as civilians and journalists, from valid military targets. Among its many rules, the manual states, “during hostilities involving cyber operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, individual civilians, and civilian objects” (p. 137, para. 5). To comply with these rules, militaries need to properly attribute an attack to an adversary, as well as be able to target the infrastructure of the enemy while minimizing the impact to civilians (Schmitt & NATO, 2013).'

Thomas Fox-Brewster illustrates this complexity in a 2015 Forbes article. Citing a report from cybersecurity company Trend Micro, Fox-Brewster wrote that, in early 2015 authorities purportedly falsely accused a Gaza man of anti-Israeli hacking. This attack misattribution could quite plausibly put an otherwise innocent individual at risk of undue reprisal (2015). Nation-states can also be the victim of sloppy attribution. In a May 2015 blog post, noted cybersecurity researcher Brian Krebs called out a small Colorado-based cybersecurity firm that had “boasted it had thwarted plans by organized Russian cyber criminals to launch an attack against multiple US-based banks” (Krebs, 2015, \"Security Firm Redefines APT,\" para. 1). Researching further, Krebs found the activity was likely linked to “unsophisticated Nigerian phishers” (Krebs, 2015, \"Security Firm Redefines APT,\" para. 1) rather than Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.'

For clarity, the material appears into five main sections: a review of cyber threats and threat actors, a discussion of common attribution techniques, a discussion of innovative attribution techniques, a review of published reports on specific attacks, and finally a discussion of the Cyber Kill Chain. The literature review presents an analysis of published research into network and code based attribution techniques as well as other attribution-focused papers. The included real-world reports provide contrast between theoretical attribution and attribution in practice. The included Cyber Kill Chain provides a suggested structure to categorize and evaluate evidence items.' (Sean B.

This section presents background information, including the cost and scope associated with attacks. The section discusses the types of threat actors and the threat they pose as well as common attacks.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.6)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - Data breach statistics from Verizon's report</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'By the numbers. According to Verizon’s 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report, in 60% of breaches investigated, attackers needed only minutes to compromise their target (2015). The malware problem is also pervasive, over the course of 2014 researchers identified approximately 170 million malware events. All totaled, 2,122 reported data breaches caused an estimated $400 million in damages (Verizon, 2015). Point of Sale (POS) intrusions, crimeware (cyber crime related malware), and cyber espionage were the top three sources of confirmed data breaches as illustrated in Figure 1.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.7)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Understanding the motives behind cyber attacks</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Cyber crime makes up the bulk of the confirmed data breaches. Verizon reports that an estimated two-thirds of cyber espionage events in 2014 remain unattributed to an attacker (2015). Behind each of the breaches detailed in the Verizon report are varying motives which become part of the overall attribution puzzle as noted by The Economist (2012). Along with the scope of the problem, it may be helpful to understand the threat actors at play.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.7)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - The diversity of threat actors and their motivations</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Threat actors. As noted in, Cyber Intelligence: Setting the Landscape for an Emerging Discipline, published by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, “Attack motives vary from simple curiosity, personal vendettas, financial or intellectual property gain, and/or a desire to harm an institution or state” (Intelligence and National Security Alliance, 2011, p. 7, para. 9).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.7)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 6, 7 - Types of attacks and their characteristics</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attack types. To gain a foothold into a targeted network, threat actors use a range of attacks. In their book, Targeted Cyber attacks Aditya K. Sood and Richard Enbody divided targeted attacks into two categories, direct and indirect attacks. The authors compared the two types of attacks stating direct attacks use vulnerabilities to gain access to servers and other systems, while indirect attacks use several layered attacks including things like phishing emails to compromise a target (Sood & Enbody, 2014). Common attacks noted by Sood and Enbody included advanced malware, automated frameworks, phishing e-mails, social engineering, and vulnerabilities and exploits (2014). To paraphrase the findings of Sood and Enbody (2014): \r\n- Malware: Designed to be stealthy, advanced malware can go undetected for a long period. \r\n- Automated frameworks: Automated exploit kits enable targeted exploitation of web browsers. These frameworks fingerprint web browser and only attack vulnerable browsers. \r\n- Phishing e-mails: e-mails designed to look legitimate and trap the target. They are the most common attack vector in targeted attacks. \r\n- Social engineering: Social engineering involves manipulating the users by exploiting trust. Social can take advantage of users lack of understanding about technology. \r\n- Vulnerabilities and exploits: The use of zero-day exploits that target previously unknown vulnerabilities, as well as known vulnerabilities, is a common aspect of cyber attacks.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.9)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'In a report by Krekel, Adams, and Bakos to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, it was reported that the Chinese military was researching denial of service attacks (DOS) as part of its Computer Network Attack (CNA) capability (2012). DOS attacks, while not a means of gaining access to a system, are used by attackers to flood targeted systems with junk traffic to deny the adversary use of the system (Krekel et al., 2012). Verizon reported that, over the course of 2014, the most common types of DOS attacks used poorly protected Network Time Protocol (NTP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) servers (2015). In one attack involving NTP the attack bandwidth maxed out at 325 Gigabits per second (Gbps) (Verizon, 2015).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.10)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - Review of common attribution techniques</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attribution Techniques \r\nOn the topic of attribution, only a small number of comprehensive academic papers are publicly available. These papers focus either on attribution techniques or on the role and importance of attribution itself. The goal of this section of the literature review was to collect and categorize existing cyber attribution reports and identify types of evidence mentioned in each. This paper contains information taken from general attribution papers, i.e. papers about the topic of cyber attribution, and papers focused on network and code based attribution. This section also includes a discussion of open source intelligence and the value of investigating financial evidence related to attacks.' (Sean B.

GhostNet also targeted Tibetan institutions including the Office of his Holiness the Dalai Lama, a Tibetan Non-governmental Organization (NGO), as well as the Tibetan Government-in-Exile (Information Warfare Monitor, 2009).'

Using a mix of disk-based and network-based forensic analysis, as well as OSINT, the GhostNet reports attributed the attacks to the Chinese government. A sizable operation, at least 1,295 systems were infected with the GhostNet RAT. The Information Warfare Monitor researchers used the following evidenced items to make their attribution: \r\n- IP addresses used by the attackers \r\n- Researchers found and accessed the web-based interfaces of the C2 servers, giving researchers a view of other organizations targeted by GhostNet. \r\n- By accessing (Hack-back) the GhostNet C2 servers researchers could monitor the GhostNet attackers as they sent commands to infected systems \r\n- Purchase and control of multiple domain names \r\n- Researchers used a honeypot to monitor attackers, identify attacker DSL connections, and identify additional malicious servers \r\n- Traffic was captured from multiple infected networks to detect hostile activity' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p.25)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Attacker TTP. Like Putter Panda, the team behind GhostNet sent their victims spear-phishing messages. These messages contained infected documents that installed the GhostNet RAT. The attackers also used infected web servers to infect users. The attackers obscured their activity by disguising commands as images and using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with the C2 servers. The targeting of Tibetan groups and other Chinese dissident groups strongly pointed to China as the source of the attacks (Information Warfare Monitor, 2009).' (Sean B.

Identification and selection of targets</li>\r\n<li>Weaponization. Embedding a RAT into a payload file such as a PDF or Word document</li>\r\n<li>Delivery. Transmission of the weaponized payload via email, infected webpage, USB flash media, or other vector</li>\r\n<li>Exploitation. The activation of the attackers code on the target system</li>\r\n<li>Installation. Full installation of the RAT and its persistence method</li>\r\n<li>C2. The communication channel between the attacker and the victim system</li>\r\n<li>Action on Objective. Data collection and exfiltration or other activity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEntire list (Hutchins et al., 2011).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 29)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Stopping one stage of the attack “chain” will stop the entire attack process. The authors asserted that the Intrusion Kill Chain model could help defenders detect the actions of attackers and plan defensive action. The Kill Chain has three classes of indicators, Atomic, Computed, and Behavioral. Atomic indicators, such as IP addresses and email addresses, are indicators that cannot break down into smaller parts. Derived from other data, computed indicators include hash values and regular expressions. Behavioral indicators weave atomic and computed indicators into a narrative of the actions of the attacker (Hutchins et al., 2011).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 30)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Usefulness of the Kill Chain in attack detection and attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Hutchins et al. recommended that by collecting the Kill Chains used in various attacks defenders can detect the center of gravity of attacks and detect campaigns of similar attacks. They further postulated that attack attribution, though not the original objective of the Kill Chain, may be a side effect of this structured analysis. Coincidently, the STIX framework, discussed earlier, supports the recording and sharing of attacker Kill Chain information along with many other evidence items, and conceivably could be queried in a standardized fashion (Barnum, 2014).' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 30)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The atomic, computed, and behavioral evidence items created over the course of an attack and discovered through forensic analysis, OSINT research, and other techniques, fit into to the seven stages of the attack lifecycle (reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, C2, and action on objectives) described by Hutchins et al. Evidence types may map to any stage of the lifecycle. An atomic evidence item such as an IP address, for example, could relate to reconnaissance activity or be part of the attacker’s C2.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 41)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Integration with the STIX framework and limitations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'STIX. The STIX dictionary, an excerpt of which is in Appendix A, provides a uniform method to communicate attack information. Cybox, a subset language to STIX, contains a standardized dictionary of observable actions that map nicely to the atomic, computed, and behavioral evidence items identified across the five papers. Appendix B contains an excerpt from the Cybox dictionary. Cybox allows investigators to document attacker behaviors in granular detail for communication to others using STIX. Building a picture of each stage of the attack lifecycle using the standardized nomenclature provided by STIX and Cybox creates a scalable and sharable process to attribute attacks.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'A few factors limit the effectiveness of this capstone research paper. This paper used published reports, articles, and academic research as source material. Private organizations likely have proprietary methods not documented here. Military and intelligence agencies are, as well, likely to use methods unaccounted for in this paper. Secrecy may also conceal the usefulness of techniques presented in academic research papers but not seen in practice.' (Sean B. McVey, Cynthia Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>"

Nation-states use cyber attacks as a means to gain an economic, political, and strategic advantage over their adversaries. In a May 2014 indictment in the Western District of Pennsylvania, five Chinese nationals, who are members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, were indicted for economic espionage and other charges for hacking into American companies. This marked the first time the U.S. government had charged individuals from another country with economic espionage conducted via cyber attacks (Hickton, 2014). This shows that nation-states are using cyber attacks as a means to conduct espionage and steal trade secrets from other countries.' (McVey & Gonnella, 2015, p. 23)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Cyber criminals and hacktivists</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Another group of threat actors are cyber criminals. These individuals or groups use cyber attacks for financial gain. They may use ransomware to extort money from victims, steal credit card information, or conduct fraudulent activities. Cyber criminals are motivated by the potential for significant financial rewards with relatively low risk of getting caught or facing severe consequences.' (McVey & Gonnella, 2015, p. 24)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Hacktivists are a different type of threat actor who use cyber attacks to promote a political agenda or social change. They often target organizations or governments they perceive as corrupt or unjust. Hacktivists may deface websites, leak sensitive information, or disrupt services to draw attention to their cause and influence public opinion. Their attacks are often ideologically driven rather than financially motivated.' (McVey & Gonnella, 2015, p. 24)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Disgruntled insiders and terrorist groups</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Disgruntled insiders pose a unique threat as they have legitimate access to the organization's systems and data. These individuals may conduct cyber attacks out of revenge, personal grievances, or financial motives. Insider threats are challenging to detect and prevent because they involve trusted individuals exploiting their access for malicious purposes.' (McVey & Gonnella, 2015, p. 25)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Terrorist groups also utilize cyber attacks to further their agendas. These groups may seek to cause widespread disruption, fear, and damage to critical infrastructure. While terrorist groups currently have limited cyber capabilities compared to nation-states and organized crime, their potential to grow and conduct significant cyber attacks remains a concern for national security.' (McVey & Gonnella, 2015, p. 25)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Hackers and script kiddies</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Hackers, often driven by the challenge and thrill of breaking into systems, can vary widely in skill and intent. Some may conduct cyber attacks to prove their abilities, while others may be motivated by ideological beliefs or financial gain. Among hackers, there are also \"script kiddies,\" individuals with limited technical skills who use pre-written scripts or tools to conduct attacks. While they may not have the same level of expertise as more experienced hackers, script kiddies can still cause significant damage, especially if they target vulnerable systems.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The significance of OSINT in attack attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'OSINT and other research. When discussing attack attribution, the importance of OSINT research cannot be overstated. Analysis of IPs, ASs, and domain name registration records are all examples of OSINT. Beyond Internet related items, corporate registration information, phone directories, and other public records all hold information valuable to investigators.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Practical applications of OSINT in notable reports</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The APT1 report and the Putter Panda report both cite the use of OSINT. For example, a search for the ‘cpyy’ handle by researchers found images of the attacker and location on the image sharing service Picasa. A search for the ‘cpyy’ account also linked it to a profile on rootkit.com with additional identifying information. Similar searches conducted as part of the APT1 investigation found useful attribution information on websites linked to individual attackers. Using these same techniques, researchers found a wealth of information related to Unit 61398 of the Chinese PLA, attributed by Mandiant with the attacks.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The OSINT used across all of the reports represents an effective way to move past the technical aspects of the cyber threat to identify the person or group behind the keyboard. For many investigators outside of law enforcement or intelligence circles, OSINT is the only legal way to connect evidence from cyberspace to a person. A well-crafted search engine query is a powerful investigative tool.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Domain name record analysis as a key OSINT method</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Domain name record analysis. Domain names, names mapped to IP addresses, are a ubiquitous feature of the Internet. For example, people remember and use the domain name yahoo.com, rather than the actual IP address of the website. Attackers use domain names for a slightly different reason. Using domain names, attackers can point a name to different IP addresses as needed and may choose a domain name similar to a legitimate service to further camouflage attack activity. Fortunately, for investigators, the information found in domain name records is publicly available and may link a domain to other attacker domains or the identity of the attacker.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Real-world examples of domain name analysis in investigations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Four of the five reports analyzed cite analysis of domain name records as part of investigation. The Putter Panda report provides a powerful example of the value of domain name analysis. In the report, a common handle, “cpyy” linked multiple domain name records together. Analyzing the domain name records identified the attacker’s likely locations and real world identity. Using the information collected from the Putter Panda domain name records researchers performed additional OSINT searches.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - IP and Autonomous System analysis in attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Analysis of IPs and Autonomous Systems. Used across multiple reports, analysis of the history and ownership of an IP address and the relationships between groups of IP addresses is a common source attribution information.

For example, people remember and use the domain name yahoo.com, rather than the actual IP address of the website. Attackers use domain names for a slightly different reason. Using domain names, attackers can point a name to different IP addresses as needed and may choose a domain name similar to a legitimate service to further camouflage attack activity. Fortunately, for investigators, the information found in domain name records is publicly available and may link a domain to other attacker domains or the identity of the attacker.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Analysis of domain name records is a common and effective investigative technique</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Four of the five reports analyzed cite analysis of domain name records as part of investigation. The Putter Panda report provides a powerful example of the value of domain name analysis. In the report, a common handle, “cpyy” linked multiple domain name records together. Analyzing the domain name records identified the attacker’s likely locations and real world identity. Using the information collected from the Putter Panda domain name records researchers performed additional OSINT searches.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Analysis of IPs and Autonomous Systems. Used across multiple reports, analysis of the history and ownership of an IP address and the relationships between groups of IP addresses is a common source attribution information. Using public records, investigators can identify the general location of an IP and identify the owner of the block of IPs related to the IP. All five of the reports evaluated for this paper reference analysis of IP addresses as part of their investigation. In each case, investigators identified the location of C2 IP addresses.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Monitoring attackers mid-attack can yield valuable insights</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Monitoring the Attacker. Catching the attacker in the act presents investigators the opportunity to monitor the actions of the attacker in more detail than forensic analysis conducted after the fact. In both the GhostNet investigation and the Pushdo malware investigation, investigators monitored network traffic to understand how each threat operated as each attack unfolded. Monitoring the network traffic of the attacker and their tools provides insight into the objective and motive of the attacker as well as their TTP. The TTP can include the tools and techniques attackers use, how they communicate with their C2, and other critical details.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The GhostNet report also documented the use of a honeypot to monitor the attacker’s actions. In particular, the honeypot used by the GhostNet researchers allowed them to monitor attackers and find additional C2 servers. Using the honeypot, researchers also identified several IP addresses linked to Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connections in Hainan Island, China.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Forensic analysis provides a timeline of attacker activity.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Forensics. Computer forensics, sometimes called disk-based forensics or dead-box forensics, includes the analysis of logs, system configuration files, file system artifacts, and the files themselves. Often, computer forensics can provide a timeline of attacker activity on a system and identify changes made by malware or attacker tools. It is critical investigators keep in mind evidence items found through forensic investigation may serve as the basis for further research. In this way, the investigation process is no different from a traditional investigation where a piece of evidence may identify a new suspect or lead to a new avenue of investigation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Network-based forensics can uncover valuable evidence through traffic analysis.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Network-based forensics involves the collection and analysis of network traffic and can uncover atomic level evidence such as the ports and IP addresses used by the attackers, the Internet protocols they used, and higher-level evidence such as the contents of captured traffic. Investigators often employ network-based forensics to monitor honeypots, targeted computers, or even whole networks. Because of the value of network-based forensics, many organizations proactively capture and keep network traffic for days or even months.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Forensic analysis of binaries identified through computer and network forensics opens further avenues of investigation. Atomic and computed tool marks found in code may include evidence of the developer’s spoken language and their computer environment. Code analysis, like disk-based and network-based forensics, may inform further investigation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Examining victim systems can reveal unique evidence types.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Examining the victim computer system and its network identifies evidence items about the attack and attacker not available through other means. Across the five reports, four evidence items fall into the forensic category: code disassembly, tool marks, disk-based artifacts, and network-based artifacts. Forensic analysis directed at understanding the function of code was part of two reports: In the APT1 report, analysis of tool marks provided insight into the development of malware and its source and in the Pushdo report, malware analysis identified the function of code by examining its construction. The APT1 report cited one disk-based evidence item, the keyboard language setting for Remote desktop, as part of their investigation as well.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Other types. As indicated in Table 1, eight evidence items were outside the OSINT and forensics categories. These include attacker motive, mailbox contents, direct interaction, and language indicators. All four are high-level behavioral evidence items made up of smaller atomic and computed items. The most interesting of these four may be attacker motive. If discerned early it becomes part of the overall attribution process. The motive could also go unknown until late in the attribution process.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Few evidence types are consistently used across reports.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Allowing that each report may not fully document every aspect of the attribution process, it is striking how few evidence types exist across the reports. Of the nineteen evidence types, even fewer exist across the majority of reports. The small number of evidence types identified in Table 1 demonstrates that researchers based their attribution on only a small set of forensic evidence items searched using OSINT. These OSINT searches led to attributable information, which led to further OSINT searching. This heavy reliance on public records and incidental evidence found on blogs and other websites seems ripe for misdirection and misattribution.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - OSINT and forensic evidence provide a framework for consistent attribution.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Evidence gained through language analysis, reconnaissance, threat intelligence, and direct attacker interaction, add additional certainty, but are underused. Non-OSINT evidence items do not rely on publicly available (attacker-provided) data, reducing the risk of deliberate misdirection. Researchers can reasonably expect the usefulness of OSINT to decrease as attackers grow more sophisticated.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Value of Frameworks. STIX and the intrusion kill chain are frameworks for conceptualizing cyber attacks. Each together provides investigators a tool to improve consistency in the attribution process and aid in placing evidence items in context to each other across the whole attack lifecycle. Using consistent documentation, investigators can build profiles of attacks, providing the possibility of identifying threat groups if they return. Additionally, by sharing attack information in a structured format such as STIX, others can identify attackers by their documented TTP. Attackers can easily change domain names and IP addresses but it is much more difficult and expensive for the attacker to change tools and tactics.'</blockquote>"

The authors asserted that the Intrusion Kill Chain model could help defenders detect the actions of attackers and plan defensive action. The Kill Chain has three classes of indicators, Atomic, Computed, and Behavioral. Atomic indicators, such as IP addresses and email addresses, are indicators that cannot break down into smaller parts. Derived from other data, computed indicators include hash values and regular expressions. Behavioral indicators weave atomic and computed indicators into a narrative of the actions of the attacker (Hutchins et al., 2011).' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Application of the Kill Chain in defense and attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Hutchins et al. recommended that by collecting the Kill Chains used in various attacks defenders can detect the center of gravity of attacks and detect campaigns of similar attacks. They further postulated that attack attribution, though not the original objective of the Kill Chain, may be a side effect of this structured analysis. Coincidently, the STIX framework, discussed earlier, supports the recording and sharing of attacker Kill Chain information along with many other evidence items, and conceivably could be queried in a standardized fashion (Barnum, 2014).'

Each together provides investigators a tool to improve consistency in the attribution process and aid in placing evidence items in context to each other across the whole attack lifecycle. Using consistent documentation, investigators can build profiles of attacks, providing the possibility of identifying threat groups if they return. Additionally, by sharing attack information in a structured format such as STIX, others can identify attackers by their documented TTP. Attackers can easily change domain names and IP addresses but it is much more difficult and expensive for the attacker to change tools and tactics.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 41)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Value of Structured Documentation and Detailed Analysis</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Intrusion kill chain. The atomic, computed, and behavioral evidence items created over the course of an attack and discovered through forensic analysis, OSINT research, and other techniques, fit into to the seven stages of the attack lifecycle (reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, C2, and action on objectives) described by Hutchins et al. Evidence types may map to any stage of the lifecycle. An atomic evidence item such as an IP address, for example, could relate to reconnaissance activity or be part of the attacker’s C2.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 41)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Carefully documenting each evidence item found across the attack lifecycle creates a picture of the attacker.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - The Role of STIX and Cybox in Enhancing Cybersecurity</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'STIX. The STIX dictionary, an excerpt of which is in Appendix A, provides a uniform method to communicate attack information. Cybox, a subset language to STIX, contains a standardized dictionary of observable actions that map nicely to the atomic, computed, and behavioral evidence items identified across the five papers. Appendix B contains an excerpt from the Cybox dictionary. Cybox allows investigators to document attacker behaviors in granular detail for communication to others using STIX. Building a picture of each stage of the attack lifecycle using the standardized nomenclature provided by STIX and Cybox creates a scalable and sharable process to attribute attacks.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Limitations of the study A few factors limit the effectiveness of this capstone research paper. This paper used published reports, articles, and academic research as source material. Private organizations likely have proprietary methods not documented here. Military and intelligence agencies are, as well, likely to use methods unaccounted for in this paper. Secrecy may also conceal the usefulness of techniques presented in academic research papers but not seen in practice.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Limitations of the Study</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The study relied on a relatively small sample of attribution reports. A wider sample would likely identify additional evidence items and methods. Time constraints imposed by the capstone process limit the amount of time spent on researching source material. Restrictions on the use of interviews further prevented the acquisition of purpose-driven data.' (McVey, Gonnella, 2015, p. 42)</blockquote>"

The ICJ, however, has limited ability to compel production of evidence and instead often relies either on a compromis containing agreed factual stipulations or on documentary dossiers submitted by each of the parties. The Court must therefore depend on the parties' cooperation in submitting a sufficient evidentiary basis in order to make critical factual determinations. So what happens when one of the parties has exclusive access to critical evidence and refuses to produce it for security or other reasons?' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Historical significance of the Corfu Channel case</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the ICJ's first contentious case, Corfu Channel, the Court delineated procedural, evidentiary, and equitable rules that have shaped many of the Court's subsequent decisions. Specifically, the Court addressed two significant issues in Corfu Channel: (1) the Court's attitude towards nonproduction of classified evidence, and (2) the rules surrounding the use of circumstantial evidence. In 2007, fifty-eight years after Corfu Channel, the Court readdressed these same evidentiary issues in the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Crime of Genocide).' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - The ICJ's flexible approach to evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Over the years, the ICJ has taken a flexible approach to the admissibility of evidence. The Court evaluates the authenticity, reliability, and persuasiveness of the materials submitted by the parties. One possible reason for the Court's malleable approach, according to the ICJ's former Registrar, Eduardo Valencia-Ospina, is the Court's perceived ability to \"ascertain the weight and relevance of particular evidence\" due to the judges' qualifications and experience. The Court, therefore, permits the parties to submit many types of direct and circumstantial evidence. Because of this flexible approach, the Court has not found the need to articulate its evidence policy in many cases.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Clarification of evidentiary standards in the Crime of Genocide case</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Despite this history of flexibility, the Court was candid about its decision to use Crime of Genocide to clarify the Court's evidentiary standards. This decision to reevaluate evidentiary principles will profoundly impact future cases. The judgment is particularly poignant given the fact that the Court's docket currently includes a case brought by Croatia against Serbia dealing with largely the same issues and allegations as Crime of Genocide.'

For example, under the Statute of the ICJ (ICJ Statute) and the ICJ's Rules of Court, the ICJ can request that parties provide the Court with documents, ask questions to the parties, call on international organizations to provide relevant information, call witnesses and experts at its own initiative, conduct site inspections, and entrust third persons with \"the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Traditional reliance on parties for evidence production</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Nevertheless, by tradition, the ICJ has relied principally on the parties to a case for production of evidence, and since the parties are sovereign states, the Court does not have the power to compel them to produce evidence. Significantly, Article 49 of the ICJ Statute provides the Court with a device to offset this deficiency. Namely, the Court can take \"formal note\" of any refusal by the parties to turn over the requested materials.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - Use of \"formal note\" and adverse inferences</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'While the ICJ Statute does not provide further guidance, such \"formal note\" can be used in several different ways. For example, applying the approach of international arbitration tribunals, the ICJ could \"infer\" that the non-produced evidence \"would be adverse to the interests\" of the non-producing party. This approach constitutes, in essence, a reversal of the burden of proof.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Application of adverse inferences in practice</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In this regard, the Court will not permit a party to rely on circumstantial evidence just because the other party is keeping evidence confidential. The UK kept information confidential in Corfu Channel, and Serbia kept information confidential in Crime of Genocide. The Court does not find a party's decision to keep information secret enough to warrant automatically liberal reliance on circumstantial evidence. It remains to be seen whether the Court would liberally construe circumstantial evidence from a party if the opposing party kept evidence confidential and still materially relied on it. The UK did not rely on documents that it kept secret from Albania and the Court in Corfu Channel. Interestingly, in Crime of Genocide, it was Bosnia that first referred to the redacted documents, and Serbia was permitted to respond. Serbia, therefore, used these redacted documents, but it did not heavily or arguably even directly rely on these redacted documents to state its case.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Finally, the ICJ's case law discussed herein indicates a hierarchy of preferred evidence. The Court favors direct evidence over circumstantial evidence. The Court finds factual evidence that has been put through the trial process more persuasive than factual evidence that has not withstood cross-examination. Thus, if reliable direct evidence contradicts circumstantial evidence, the Court is unlikely to rely on the circumstantial evidence. Therefore, a party's ability to rely on circumstantial evidence may depend on the strength of its opponent's case. Serbia, for example, was able to furnish reliable direct evidence in its favor, but Albania was not.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - ICJ's approach compared to domestic courts</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Although the Court adopted the evidentiary principle of permitting a state \"more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence\" from other international decisions and domestic legal systems, the ICJ's use of circumstantial evidence differs from domestic courts' in some ways. Judge Owada explained that the \"procedures and rules on evidence [in an international court] seem to be much less developed, and the task of the Court for fact finding much more demanding, than in the case of the national courts.\" This may be in part because of domestic courts' power to compel production of evidence. The ICJ, on the other hand, can merely \"call upon the agents to produce any document or to supply any explanations.\" If the parties do not comply, then \"formal note shall be taken of any refusal,\" but production cannot be compelled. Thus, the Court may only have before it circumstantial evidence of a claim or may be confined to limited direct evidence. It has consequently carefully chosen when to rely on circumstantial evidence. These insights should help both litigants before the ICJ and scholars and practitioners who strive to comprehend fully the Court's judgments.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - Proposal for appointing a \"special master\"</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Having disclosed and explained the nuances of the ICJ's approach to nonproduction of evidence in the exclusive control of a party, a final question is whether the Court's approach could be modified to better ensure the fair administration of justice. For example, consistent with the powers vested in the Court by the ICJ Statute, at the pre-trial stage of cases requiring production of evidence, the ICJ could appoint a \"special master\" who would monitor discovery and act as a mediator relating to discovery disputes. This approach would enable the Court to settle in detail which facts are uncontested, what evidence the parties accept, and which issues need further clarification.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - Enhancing the Court's evidence-handling capabilities</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'As part of the process, the special master could recommend production orders and suggest inferences of fact that should be taken in response to a party's failure to produce relevant evidence exclusively in its possession. This approach would shift the ICJ from merely sanctioning liberal recourse to circumstantial evidence in response to nonproduction to explicitly taking adverse findings of fact in appropriate circumstances. Following the example of domestic courts, such adverse findings of fact should be made only after prior warning and should be subject to reopening if the information is produced by a given date.'

                "content": "<div>\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 1 - Importance of ICJ precedents</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Although ICJ cases are binding only on the parties to the particular dispute, and thus do not statutorily have precedential value, the Court, other international bodies, and domestic courts frequently cite and heavily rely on past ICJ cases. In fact, many studies and evaluations of ICJ cases contend that the international community views ICJ decisions as having precedential value.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Influence of ICJ's treatment of evidentiary issues</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Therefore, the ICJ's treatment of evidentiary issues in one case can have significant bearing on how it will likely treat similar issues in the future. This Section examines the ICJ's early case law on the question of circumstantial evidence and adverse inferences.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 3, 4 - The Corfu Channel Case: Burden of proof and reliance on circumstantial evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In its first contentious case, Corfu Channel, the ICJ faced burden of proof issues involving secret evidence, lack of defensive evidence, and circumstantial evidence. The case was between the UK and Albania and involved the North Corfu Channel, a strait between Albania and Greece. On October 22, 1946, British warships went through the channel. Two ships, the Saumarez and the Volage, struck mines while in Albanian territorial waters and sustained damage.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'To hold Albania responsible for the mines in its territorial waters, the UK attempted to prove that Albania had knowledge of the mines. The Court recognized that the fact the minefield was discovered in Albanian territorial waters was not enough to prove that Albania had such knowledge. However, the Court also recognized that Albania's exclusive territorial control over its waters could make it impossible for the UK to \"furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility.\" To solve this dilemma, the Court permitted the UK to take \"more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.\" The Court included the caveat, however, that proof may only be drawn from such inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence where doing so leaves no room for reasonable doubt.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - The South West Africa Cases: Use of circumstantial evidence to prove improper motive</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the South West Africa Cases, the Court considered what weight should be given to circumstantial evidence. Ethiopia and Liberia, which were members of the former League of Nations, alleged that the Republic of South Africa contravened the League of Nations Mandate for South West Africa. Among the questions the Court addressed in this case were whether the Mandate was still in force, whether South Africa had to produce annual reports to the General Assembly, whether South Africa had promoted the well-being and social progress of the peoples in South West Africa, whether South Africa violated the Mandate by engaging in military actions, and whether South Africa violated the Mandate when it tried to modify the Mandate without General Assembly approval. Judge Van Wyk, in his separate opinion, briefly addressed the relevance of circumstantial evidence in relation to determining whether or not South Africa practiced apartheid and whether South Africa \"failed to promote to the utmost the material and moral well-being and social progress of the inhabitants of the Territory.\" Judge Van Wyk opined on how \"[a]n improper purpose or motive may be proved.\" He recognized that, although direct statements could prove improper purpose or motive, it is more frequently proven by circumstantial evidence. His opinion stands for the proposition that one may deduce that an act was motivated by an improper motive if that act is so unwarranted that no reasonable person with that same discretionary power and without the alleged motive would have performed it.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - The Military and Paramilitary Activities Case: Nonproduction of evidence by the US</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the Military and Paramilitary Activities case between Nicaragua and the US, Nicaragua accused the US of violating international law by supporting the Contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government. Nicaragua faced the difficult task of proving the US's involvement without access to classified information. The ICJ had to decide how to handle the nonproduction of this evidence by the US. The Court determined that it could draw adverse inferences from the US's refusal to provide the requested documents.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - The Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan Islands Case: Use of maps as circumstantial evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan Islands case involved a dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia over the sovereignty of two islands. The ICJ relied heavily on historical maps as circumstantial evidence to determine the rightful ownership. The Court recognized the limitations of using maps, noting that they often reflect the cartographer's perspective rather than definitive boundaries. Nevertheless, the Court found the maps persuasive in this case, supporting Malaysia's claim to the islands.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 8, 9 - The Oil Platforms Case: Iran's reliance on circumstantial evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the Oil Platforms case, Iran brought a claim against the US for destroying its oil platforms during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran faced challenges in providing direct evidence of the US's intent and relied on circumstantial evidence. The ICJ evaluated the credibility and relevance of Iran's evidence, ultimately ruling that the evidence was insufficient to support Iran's claims.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The ICJ's approach in these cases highlights its cautious use of circumstantial evidence. The Court consistently emphasizes the need for such evidence to be reliable and corroborated by other facts. The preference for direct evidence remains, but the Court acknowledges the role circumstantial evidence can play when direct evidence is unavailable or incomplete.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 10 - Observations about the ICJ's treatment of circumstantial evidence prior to 2005</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The analysis of these early cases demonstrates that the ICJ has maintained a consistent approach to circumstantial evidence. The Court permits its use but requires a high standard of reliability and corroboration. The ICJ's methodology reflects a balance between flexibility in evidentiary rules and the necessity of ensuring that conclusions drawn from circumstantial evidence are well-founded and just.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Namely, the UK established that Albania kept a close watch over the waters of North Corfu Channel and that Albania had the ability to observe mine laying from the Albanian Coast. The Court found that a declaration by the Albanian Delegate in the Security Council, diplomatic notes from Albania regarding the passage of ships through its territorial waters, messages to the Secretary-General, and evidence of past mine sweeps conducted by Albania together revealed that Albania was vigilant in controlling its waters.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Proximity of mines to the Albanian coast</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Moreover, the Court noted that there were many observation points along the coast, and a mine-layer placing the closest mine would have had to be within five hundred meters of the Albanian coast. This circumstantial evidence adequately proved that Albania knew of the mines in the Corfu Channel. Albania consequently violated international law by failing to warn the British ships about the mines. Thus, the Court inferred from the fact that Albania patrols and monitors its territorial waters that Albania had acquired legal responsibility for the damage to the British ships.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 5, 6 - Legal responsibility of the UK</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Albania contended that the UK violated Albanian sovereignty by sending warships through the North Corfu Channel without obtaining authorization from the Albanian government. The Court determined that the UK did not violate international law because all states have a right to send warships through international waterways as long as such passage is innocent. Albania contended that the British warships' navigation through the North Corfu Channel on October 22, 1946 was not innocent. Albania alleged that the formation of the ships, the position of the ships' guns, the presence of soldiers on board, and the number of soldiers on board all showed bellicose intent.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The Court requested that the UK produce documents, titled XCU, which the commander of the ship Volage made reference to on October 23, 1946. Citing naval secrecy, the agent for the UK refused to produce the documents. In contrast to the language the Court used with regard to the issue of Albania's legal responsibility, the Court observed that it could not draw from the UK's refusal to produce the documents \"any conclusions differing from those to which the actual events gave rise.\" A variety of other, direct evidence produced by the UK contradicted Albania's claim, and, as a result, the Court found that the UK had not violated the sovereignty of Albania.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - Analysis of evidentiary principles</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'How can we reconcile the fact that the ICJ permitted the UK \"liberal recourse to inferences of fact\" regarding Albania's knowledge of the mines yet did not allow Albania to rely on liberal inferences in response to the UK's refusal to produce secret evidence? The difference between Albania's and the UK's evidentiary situations is the ability to furnish direct proof of a claim. Albania had the ability to gather evidence on the nature of the British warships' passage through the strait. For example, Albania had eyewitness accounts of the ships' movements. The UK, on the other hand, did not have the ability to gather evidence to determine whether Albania knew of the mines in its territorial waters. This information was in the exclusive control of Albania.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - Conditions for liberal reliance on circumstantial evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Therefore, the facts of exclusive control and availability of other evidence harmonize the Court's treatment of circumstantial evidence for Albania and the UK. The Court refuses in all circumstances to infer conclusions that contradict evidence of actual events, regardless of whether a party is producing all of its evidence on the subject. The Court will permit liberal reliance on circumstantial evidence so long as two conditions are met: (1) the direct evidence is under the exclusive control of the opposing party; and (2) the circumstantial evidence does not contradict any available direct evidence or accepted facts.'

Ethiopia and Liberia, which were members of the former League of Nations, alleged that the Republic of South Africa contravened the League of Nations Mandate for South West Africa. Among the questions the Court addressed in this case were whether the Mandate was still in force, whether South Africa had to produce annual reports to the General Assembly, whether South Africa had promoted the well-being and social progress of the peoples in South West Africa, whether South Africa violated the Mandate by engaging in military actions, and whether South Africa violated the Mandate when it tried to modify the Mandate without General Assembly approval. Judge Van Wyk, in his separate opinion, briefly addressed the relevance of circumstantial evidence in relation to determining whether or not South Africa practiced apartheid and whether South Africa \"failed to promote to the utmost the material and moral well-being and social progress of the inhabitants of the Territory.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Judge Van Wyk's opinion on circumstantial evidence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Judge Van Wyk opined on how \"[a]n improper purpose or motive may be proved.\" He recognized that, although direct statements could prove improper purpose or motive, it is more frequently proven by circumstantial evidence. His opinion stands for the proposition that one may deduce that an act was motivated by an improper motive if that act is so unwarranted that no reasonable person with that same discretionary power and without the alleged motive would have performed it.' (Scharf & Day, 2012)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

In particular, he opined that the Court should have been more detailed in its measures and in its statement of material facts.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Categorization of evidence by Judge Lauterpacht</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Judge Lauterpacht described the evidence Bosnia put forward as falling into two categories: (1) written primary evidence and (2) written secondary evidence. The secondary evidence included statements of fact adopted by organs of the UN. Lauterpacht wrote that \"there is no reason why the Court should not take both such categories of evidence into account.\"' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'He then went on to discuss a particular type of circumstantial evidence, namely facts that are \"public knowledge.\" Relying on past ICJ cases, Lauterpacht championed the doctrine of judicial notice for facts that are public knowledge. This circumstantial evidence must still be wholly consistent with the main facts and circumstances of the case.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Application of public knowledge evidence and consistency with main facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Judge Lauterpacht cited the Court's reliance on circumstantial evidence in Corfu Channel when discussing the question of the complicity of Serbia in assisting the Bosnian Serb forces in Bosnia. Judge Lauterpacht likened Bosnia's situation to that of the UK, in that Bosnia could not obtain absolute proof of Serbia's complicity because the bulk of the conduct originated within the territory of Serbia.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Therefore, he relied on circumstantial evidence from Bosnia, including secondary reports derived from sources that are not sufficiently identified. This evidence, in Judge Lauterpacht's view, indicated Yugoslav involvement in Serbian activity in Bosnia and, at the very least, shifted the burden of proof to Serbia. Serbia made no attempt to meet this burden and did not rebut Bosnia's material in circumstantial detail.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Conclusion on the use of circumstantial evidence and judicial notice</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Therefore, Judge Lauterpacht, using Corfu Channel, was willing to rely on circumstantial evidence. He found that the circumstantial evidence comported with the primary evidence, and he found it notable that Serbia did not rebut any of Bosnia's circumstantial evidence.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 137)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In its judgment on the merits, however, the Court took a different view.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 138)</blockquote>"

One reason the Court cited for this decision is that Bosnia already had access to extensive evidence, in particular from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Thus, the Court did not call upon Serbia to provide these documents to Bosnia. The Court did note, however, that it had the power to draw its own conclusions based on Serbia's nonproduction.'

Bosnia contended that evidence of Serbia's efforts, assuming they exist, to bring to trial and punish persons guilty of violating the Genocide Convention would exist solely within Serbia. Bosnia asked the Court to make inferential deductions from patterns of evidence regarding both the Genocide Convention's requirement to investigate, prosecute, and punish genocide and the intent of Serbia to commit proven acts. Bosnia alleged that Serbia had the burden to rebut these inferences.' (Scharf & Day, 2012, p. 139)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Specific intent to commit genocide</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Bosnia argued that Serbia had the specific intent to commit genocide, which could be inferred from the patterns of conduct and the failure to prosecute the perpetrators of genocidal acts. Bosnia maintained that Serbia's actions and inactions demonstrated an overarching intent to destroy the Bosnian Muslim population, thus fulfilling the criteria for genocide.'

It has been claimed that the elucidation of a formal standard of proof is typically understood to be a distinctive common law practice. However, it cannot seriously be disputed that the need to apply a discernible standard of proof is inherent in any form of judicial decision-making. This is due to the intrinsic uncertainties in appraising evidence adduced by the parties to the dispute. Even in civil law jurisdictions, where the standard of proof is more loosely defined, standards of proof are undoubtedly still applied by the courts. What about international law? In particular, what happens when an international tribunal, such as the International Court of Justice (‘ICJ’), which is meant to reflect both civil and common law cultures, is confronted with questions pertaining to standard of proof? Are there any clearly defined standards, bearing in mind the significance of its decisions and the variety of disputes that come before it?'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Importance of applying a discernible standard of proof in judicial decision-making</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Even in civil law jurisdictions, where the standard of proof is more loosely defined, standards of proof are undoubtedly still applied by the courts.

Pursuant to the Statute, formal sources of international law include customary international law and the aforementioned general principles of law. Customary international law refers to obligations arising from state practice and opinio iuris (the belief that the practice is law). While general principles of law refer to principles that are obtained from the various domestic legal systems. In relying on either source of law, states to a particular dispute are expected to adduce evidence to convince the court that the rule exists generally in international law. In cases where there is insufficient evidence, the court is likely to consider that such a rule does not exist. In proving the existence of these legal norms, a state may do so by referring to various sources, including UN General Assembly Resolutions, domestic court decisions and domestic laws, and other international conventions. In this vein, leading commentators have referred to a ‘standard of proof’ to indicate the amount of evidence needed for the court to find that a particular international law norm exists. It is worth noting that while the usage of ‘standard of proof’ may be relevant in this context of proving the existence of law, the burden to meet this standard does not generally lie on either party to the dispute. Instead, the principle of jura novit curia applies: as the ICJ explained in Fisheries Jurisdiction, the court, ‘as an international judicial organ, is deemed to take judicial notice of international law’, and ‘the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the court’. And if no law can be shown to exist on the matter, then the Lotus principle would presumably apply to the effect that ‘whatever is not explicitly prohibited by international law is permitted’.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Consideration of special rules and allocation of burden in international law</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'For completeness, special rules may still apply to allocate the burden – that is, deviating from the principle of jura novit curia – such as when a state party seeks to restrict the application of an established rule. One expression of this principle is the proving of a regional or local customary norm, whereby the existence of certain facts between parties may prove that a customary right exists between both parties to the dispute. This question was dealt with in the Asylum case, where it was to be decided whether there was a regional or local custom permitting diplomatic asylum, which was applicable to Latin-American states. Distinguishing itself from Fisheries Jurisdiction, the ICJ held that the state ‘which relies on a custom of this kind must prove this custom is established in such a manner that it has become binding on the other [state]’. Having said that, the more common way in which standard of proof has been used is in the context of evidence required to prove a particular fact, which in some legal cultures may be better understood as burden of proof. This was the case in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v Serbia), which followed the earlier ICJ decisions of Bosnian Genocide and Corfu Channel in dealing with the question of whether the evidence that states parties adduced could find a claim. The burden of proof in proving a fact would generally lie on the party asserting the fact, as highlighted in Bosnian Genocide. The remainder of this article should thus be traversed with this meaning of standard of proof in mind.'</blockquote>"

This includes the ‘balance of probabilities’, ‘beyond possibility of reasonable doubt’, and ‘conclusive evidence’, just to name a few formulations. The variation in formulation may be explained by the practice of the judges of the court to apply in their respective domestic jurisdictions' standards.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - No distinction between civil and criminal responsibility in international law but differentiated standards of evidence may apply</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'In principle, there is no distinction between ‘civil’ and ‘criminal’ responsibility in international law, that often gives rise to differentiated standards of proof in domestic law. Yet, in proving an international wrong, there are grounds to argue that differentiated standards of evidence should apply. For instance, would it be reasonable for there to be no difference in the evidence required to prove that a state has committed an act of genocide, and the evidence required to prove that a state has failed to protect the rights of foreign investors? The ICJ surely does not think so in the application of the different standards of proof. Instead, the buffet of standards that the court has applied indicates that different situations warrant the application of different standards of proof. If we accept that differentiated standards apply in the ICJ, how does the court, then, decide which standard of proof would apply? We are of the view that the following factors can act as a guide.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Perhaps one of the most important factors that the court will take into consideration in determining the relevant standard of proof is the gravity of the charge. There are two plausible aspects to this. The first relates to whether the way in which the international wrong was committed was especially egregious; the second relates to whether the international norm is particularly important. While these two aspects may, in some cases, be intrinsically linked to each other (for instance, where the obligation not to commit genocide is violated by a state organ), there are other cases where such a difference may be relevant. The first aspect can be observed in Corfu Channel, where the court had to decide whether Albania could be made responsible for mines laid in the Corfu Channel that damaged English naval ships that were passing through it. The main argument, that the minefield was laid by Albania, was eventually de-emphasised by the United Kingdom (‘the UK’) as “no evidence in support” was provided.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Factors guiding the relevant standard of proof</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead, it followed the UK’s submission, and found that Albania was responsible under international law for the ‘explosions which occurred (in Albanian waters)’, and for ‘the damage and loss of human life which resulted from them’. Any doubt that may have lingered as to whether a different standard of proof would be applied after the Corfu Channel decision, the subsequent case of Bosnian Genocide supports the interpretation of Corfu Channel proffered above. The question before the court was whether Serbia and Montenegro could be responsible for the crimes of genocide committed during the massacre that occurred in Srebrenica. The court, in answering this question, adopted different standards of proof, dependent on whether it concerned an act or an omission.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'On one hand, in finding that Serbia and Montenegro failed to prevent genocide and to punish and extradite persons charged with genocide, the court adopted the standard of ‘a high level of certainty’. On the other hand, in finding that Serbia and Montenegro were not complicit in the commission of genocide, the court found that there must be evidence which proves ‘beyond any doubt’ that it had a specific intent to commit genocide.'</blockquote>"

The argument goes, that by virtue of the ICJ’s indication of different standards of proof in the context of different norms, this would unwittingly indicate that certain norms may be more important than others, without sound jurisprudential grounds to do so. However, the approach currently borne out from existing jurisprudence is also not free from such considerations, and hierarchies have been impliedly drawn through the adjudication of cases before the ICJ. As Judge Greenwood observed in Pulp Mills, the acknowledgement by the court in Bosnian Genocide that grave charges require a ‘high level of certainty’ implies that a lower standard of proof may be acceptable for other less grave allegations.'</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The gravity of the charge is crucial in determining the standard of proof.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Perhaps one of the most important factors that the court will take into consideration in determining the relevant standard of proof is the gravity of the charge. There are two plausible aspects to this. The first relates to whether the way in which the international wrong was committed was especially egregious; the second relates to whether the international norm is particularly important. While these two aspects may, in some cases, be intrinsically linked to each other (for instance, where the obligation not to commit genocide is violated by a state organ), there are other cases where such a difference may be relevant.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The Corfu Channel case illustrates the application of the standard of proof based on the egregiousness of the act.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The first aspect can be observed in Corfu Channel, where the court had to decide whether Albania could be made responsible for mines laid in the Corfu Channel that damaged English naval ships that were passing through it. The main argument, that the minefield was laid by Albania, was eventually de-emphasised by the United Kingdom (‘the UK’) as “no evidence in support” was furnished during its final submissions.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'But the UK had two alternative arguments: Albania had either colluded with Yugoslavia in actively laying mines in the channel, or Albania had knowingly allowed its territory to be used for acts that were contrary to the rights of other states. On the former, the UK relied on the evidence of its commander, which gave evidence from his personal knowledge that he saw mines being loaded on Yugoslav minesweepers.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The court's reliance on indirect evidence where direct evidence is insufficient.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'However, the court held that given that there was ‘no personal and direct confrontation’, this evidence could only be regarded as ‘allegations falling short of conclusive evidence… [since a] charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here’. As for the latter alternative argument, the court concluded that the minelaying would not have been possible without Albania’s knowledge. It pointed to Albania’s continued jealous watch over its territorial waters, including the Corfu Channel, as well as the existence of expert evidence. This was done to show how it would have been infeasible for a party to lay mines in the channel without Albania observing it from the Albanian coast.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Different standards of proof depending on the nature of the violation.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The court observed that they could establish the violation through inferences of fact if ‘they leave no room for reasonable doubt’. The court relied on the two pieces of indirect evidence and found that Albania was responsible under international law.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Comparison of evidence standards based on the severity of the act or omission.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'In comparing the arguments raised by the UK and its corresponding standards of proof, it appears that the particular act or omission that Albania claimed to have committed was the important factor which resulted in the court’s different standards as applied to the different claims. The court was much more willing to find the violation of international law through slightly less conclusive proof where the violation was a less egregious omission (the failure to notify the warships of the mines). This was in contrast to where the violation concerned a more egregious act (the collusion or act of laying the mines).'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - The linkage between the way a norm is violated and the standard of proof.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'But it must be noted that the ICJ ultimately framed Albania’s responsibility for breaching the obligation not to collude in laying mines from that for breaching the obligation not to knowingly use its territory for illegal purposes. Instead, it followed the UK’s submission, and found that Albania was responsible under international law for the ‘explosions which occurred (in Albanian waters)’, and for ‘the damage and loss of human life which resulted from them’.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - The implications of different standards of proof in the Bosnian Genocide case.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Any doubt that may have lingered as to whether a different standard of proof would be applied after the Corfu Channel decision, the subsequent case of Bosnian Genocide supports the interpretation of Corfu Channel proffered above. The question before the court was whether Serbia and Montenegro could be responsible for the crimes of genocide committed during the massacre that occurred in Srebrenica. The court, in answering this question, adopted different standards of proof, dependent on whether it concerned an act or an omission.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 9 - The court's application of high certainty standards for different aspects of genocide.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'On one hand, in finding that Serbia and Montenegro failed to prevent genocide and to punish and extradite persons charged with genocide, the court adopted the standard of ‘a high level of certainty’. On the other hand, in finding that Serbia and Montenegro were not complicit in the commission of genocide, the court found that there must be evidence which proves ‘beyond any doubt’ that it had a specific intent to commit genocide.'</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The ICJ considers whether the dispute involves declarative or determinative functions when deciding the standard of proof.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Another factor that the ICJ would likely look at is whether the dispute concerns a declarative or a determinative function. The declarative function refers to the court’s ascertainment of a fact (such as in defining a boundary, since the court in defining a boundary is merely declaring the boundaries which had already existed). Its determinative function refers to the court’s determination of whether an illegal act was performed (such as deciding whether a state may be made responsible for the wrongful act of its agents). When the court exercises its declarative functions compared to its determinative function, it generally applies a lower standard of proof.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Examples illustrating the application of different standards of proof by the ICJ.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A clear example is the Sovereignty Over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, where the court had to decide whether sovereignty over the disputed islands belonged to Indonesia or Malaysia. Judge Oda described the case a ‘rather weak’ one in that neither party had made a strong showing in support of its claim to title to the (disputed) islands”. He, however, noted that the court nonetheless came to a ‘reasonable decision’ on the question of sovereignty over the islands. This was consistent with the court’s decision in Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute, where it had to determine the boundary line between El Salvador and Honduras. The court acknowledged that there was ‘no great abundance of evidence either way’ in determining the interprovincial boundary of the fourth sector that justified the drawing the line of uti possidetis juris. However, it still drew the boundary ‘on a balance of probabilities’.' (Chen Siyuan, Joel Fun Wei Xuan, 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'In comparison, in Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea, the court had to determine whether there was sufficient evidence based on a tacit legal agreement to show the establishment of a permanent maritime boundary. It held that such evidence ‘must be compelling’, since the establishment of such boundaries ‘is a matter of grave importance and agreement is not easily to be presumed’. Judge Sebutinde and Vice President Sepulveda-Amor in their Dissenting Opinion and Declaration respectively in the subsequent case of Maritime Dispute have interpreted this to mean that the court applies a ‘stringent standard of proof’ while establishing a permanent maritime boundary on the basis of a tacit agreement. Similarly, in the recent case of Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean, the court observed that, there is a ‘a high threshold for proof that a maritime boundary has been established by tacit agreement’.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Lower standard of proof for provisional measures</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Article 41 of the Statute empowers the ICJ to grant provisional measures “to preserve the respective rights of either party.” In granting provisional measures, the court has indicated that a lower standard of proof would suffice. For example, in the Legality of Use of Force cases involving the former Yugoslavia and various states including Belgium, Canada, France, and Germany, the court found that a prima facie case was sufficient to establish jurisdiction for it to grant provisional measures.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Lower standard of proof even for grave norms</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This is the case even if the case concerns a particularly grave norm, as clarified in the recent Order on Provisional Measures in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Gambia v Myanmar). This case concerned the question of whether the court could grant provisional measures against Myanmar in relation to an alleged genocide that was committed on the Rohingyas. The court, in granting the provisional measures sought by the Gambia, clarified that, notwithstanding the serious nature of genocide, the standard of proof required to prove that the court has jurisdiction remains only a prima facie case. This is because the court is not (yet) ascertaining whether any violations of the Genocide Convention had occurred.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'What the court is required to do at the stage of making an order on provisional measures is only to establish whether the acts complained of “are capable of falling within the provisions of the Genocide Convention.” Moreover, this lower standard appears to apply to all aspects of the case. Both Myanmar and Gambia were parties to the Genocide Convention, but Myanmar had made a reservation to Article VIII that allowed contracting parties to “call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action” in relation to certain acts in the Genocide Convention. The court found that this reservation “did not appear” to deprive Gambia to seize the court under Article IX of the Genocide Convention. It similarly applied the standard of “prima facie standing” in favour of Gambia.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Approach when a state chooses not to appear</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A similar approach is adopted when a state chooses not to appear before the court. In Nicaragua, the US decided not to appear during the merits stage after the court found that it had jurisdiction over the case. Due to the US’s non-appearance, the court had to apply Article 53 of the Statute and determine the standard of proof that would be applicable to the case. Article 53 provides that the court is bound to “satisfy itself, not only that it has jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 36 and 37, but also that the claim is well founded in fact and law.” In interpreting the term “satisfy itself,” a higher standard of proof seems to be applicable: the court held that the facts on which any findings are based on must be supported by “convincing evidence,” so far as the nature of the case permits.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'However, it is arguable that it may be simply the case that “convincing evidence” is required in the specific context of the Nicaragua. This concerned the question of whether the US had violated the principle of non-intervention or unlawfully used force in the territory of Nicaragua, both of which are of significant gravity. Amarasinghe argues that under Article 53, “no lesser or higher standard is impliedly laid down.” This approach is reasonable in our view – it cannot be the case that a higher standard of proof is applied to an applicant in proving its case, simply because the respondent chooses not to appear before the court.'</blockquote>"

This approach is far desirable than the current approach of leaving breadcrumbs in various decisions as to the standards that would apply. This, in turn leaves the legal observer with the unenviable task of seeking to make sense of the court’s jurisprudence and trying to elucidate and predict factors and scenarios in which the court would apply certain standards. These standards are then left unexplained on a putative spectrum of standards of proof.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The court, at different times, applies standards that seem to be indistinguishable with each other, with slight difference in the terminology used, but with no indication as to how these standards relate to each other. Ultimately, the court already has the ingredients in its jurisprudence to clarify the relevant standard of proof that should apply to cases that come before it. It is not as if the court has never discussed about the applicable standard of proof to be applied in its jurisprudence – it only needs to classify and rearrange all these varying standards into intelligible categories to inject the much-needed clarity in this area of the law.'</blockquote>"

It is by far the \"heaviest\" case, in the parlance of the English barrister, ever decided by the Court in the absence of a party. It has broken new ground for the application of Article 53 of the Statute. It deals in detail with the multilateral treaty reservation of the United States (the \"Vandenberg amendment\"). It contains provocative reasoning about the genesis and maintenance of rules of customary international law, separate from treaties such as the United Nations Charter.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Seminal findings and interpretations in the Nicaragua decision</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It contains seminal findings on the use of force and the exercise of the inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter. It presents fresh and doubtless controversial interpretations of the principle of non-intervention. It prescribes limits to \"collective counter-measures\" in response to conduct not deemed to amount to \"armed attacks.\"'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The length of the Nicaragua decision, its scope, and its detail are striking. Moreover, it is accompanied by one of the most closely reasoned and yet impassioned dissenting opinions ever to be appended to a decision of the Court: that of Judge Stephen Schwebel of the United States, who wrote a total of 261 printed pages.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Comparison with the Corfu Channel case</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'How will the Nicaragua case be remembered by international lawyers in future years: for example, as is now true with the Corfu Channel case, almost 40 years hence? Corfu is now recalled as a somewhat analogous (although far more finite) litigation, also involving complex facts; but in that case the respondent Albania only withdrew in the second (compensation) phase of the proceedings, not in the critical merits phase. The Nicaragua case will probably be recalled—in the year 2027—as representing at least the following new developments: a decisive and controversial victory of a small power over a great power; an unprecedented withdrawal from proceedings, to the subsequent regret of the withdrawing party; one of the first considerations by the Court of armed conflict, and surely the first when that conflict, to one degree or another, was continuing; the pronouncement of a controversial precedent on the use of force, intervention and the right of collective self-defense in response to armed attack; and, for the first time, treatment by the Court of such a complex set of facts presented as foundation for a decision, and moreover, their substantially unilateral treatment, in the absence of the defending party, and with the Court itself operating as a \"counter-advocate\" under the strictures and requirements of Article 53.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5-6 - Complexity and sensitivity of the Nicaragua case</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It is well known that the Nicaragua case is complicated, fraught with controversy and highly sensitive. It is founded upon an intricate, shifting and controversial background of factual assertion unprecedented in the Court's history. The job of the Court would have been difficult enough, even had the United States remained fully in the proceedings and argued extensively on the merits. With the announcement of its withdrawal, however, the United States made the job of the Court virtually impossible from a factual point of view and, as some have observed, perhaps effectively foreclosed almost all options other than those adopted by the Court in its Judgment.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In fact, the Court—perhaps more dramatically than ever before in its long history—was placed in a corner. No litigator ever wishes to deny his opponent freedom to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution: the consequences of putting an adversary in a corner can be disastrous. This principle, permitting a modicum of adjustment, of freedom of movement, must emphatically be applied—a fortiori—to the tribunal before which the case is being heard. To foreclose favorable consideration by the judges can only bring a bitter harvest.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - Impact of the US withdrawal on the Court's handling of facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The decision of the United States to boycott the proceedings therefore may well have blown up in its face. As Judge Sir Robert Jennings stated in his dissenting opinion: [O]ne is bound to observe that here, where questions of fact may be every bit as important as the law, the United States can hardly complain at the inevitable consequences of its failure to plead during the substantive phase of the case. It is true that a great volume of material about the facts was provided to the Court by the United States during the earlier phases of the case. Yet a party which fails at the material stage to appear and expound and explain even the material that it has already provided, inevitably prejudices the appreciation and assessment of the facts of the case.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 8-9 - Difficulties due to nonappearance and unilateral presentation of facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Much of the difficulty that resulted from the nonappearance of the United States in the merits phase of the Nicaragua case is in fact attributable to the lack of an advocate in court to defend U.S. policy and to attack the evidence presented by Nicaragua. Thus, Judge Jennings later stated in his dissent that the nonappearance of the United States has been particularly unfortunate—perhaps not least for the United States—in a case which involves complicated questions of fact; where, in the merits phase, witnesses giving evidence as to the facts were called and examined by counsel for the Applicant, but their evidence was not tested by cross-examination by counsel for the Respondent; and where the Respondent itself provided neither oral nor documentary evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The application of Article 53 of the Statute in the Nicaragua case effectively served to highlight the importance of the Court's handling of facts. The Court was required to deal with this extraordinarily complex evidence entirely on its own, responding to the arguments and evidence presented by Nicaragua with its own questions (and, in particular, the detailed and painstaking examination from the bench of Judge Schwebel). Moreover—and perhaps just because the respondent United States was absent—the Court was obliged to theorize more than it would normally have done to justify the positions it ultimately took on matters of evidence. Rules of evidence were formulated that would clearly not have been necessary had the United States been in the courtroom to defend itself and to assist the Court in evaluating and disposing of the factual assertions made by Nicaragua.'</blockquote>"

Corfu is now recalled as a somewhat analogous (although far more finite) litigation, also involving complex facts; but in that case the respondent Albania only withdrew in the second (compensation) phase of the proceedings, not in the critical merits phase. The Nicaragua case will probably be recalled—in the year 2027—as representing at least the following new developments: a decisive and controversial victory of a small power over a great power; an unprecedented withdrawal from proceedings, to the subsequent regret of the withdrawing party; one of the first considerations by the Court of armed conflict, and surely the first when that conflict, to one degree or another, was continuing; the pronouncement of a controversial precedent on the use of force, intervention and the right of collective self-defense in response to armed attack; and, for the first time, treatment by the Court of such a complex set of facts presented as foundation for a decision, and moreover, their substantially unilateral treatment, in the absence of the defending party, and with the Court itself operating as a \"counter-advocate\" under the strictures and requirements of Article 53.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5-6 - Complexity and sensitivity of the Nicaragua case</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It is well known that the Nicaragua case is complicated, fraught with controversy and highly sensitive.

The job of the Court would have been difficult enough, even had the United States remained fully in the proceedings and argued extensively on the merits. With the announcement of its withdrawal, however, the United States made the job of the Court virtually impossible from a factual point of view and, as some have observed, perhaps effectively foreclosed almost all options other than those adopted by the Court in its Judgment.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In fact, the Court—perhaps more dramatically than ever before in its long history—was placed in a corner. No litigator ever wishes to deny his opponent freedom to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution: the consequences of putting an adversary in a corner can be disastrous. This principle, permitting a modicum of adjustment, of freedom of movement, must emphatically be applied—a fortiori—to the tribunal before which the case is being heard. To foreclose favorable consideration by the judges can only bring a bitter harvest.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - Impact of the US withdrawal on the Court's handling of facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The decision of the United States to boycott the proceedings therefore may well have blown up in its face. As Judge Sir Robert Jennings stated in his dissenting opinion: [O]ne is bound to observe that here, where questions of fact may be every bit as important as the law, the United States can hardly complain at the inevitable consequences of its failure to plead during the substantive phase of the case.

Yet a party which fails at the material stage to appear and expound and explain even the material that it has already provided, inevitably prejudices the appreciation and assessment of the facts of the case.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 8-9 - Difficulties due to nonappearance and unilateral presentation of facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Much of the difficulty that resulted from the nonappearance of the United States in the merits phase of the Nicaragua case is in fact attributable to the lack of an advocate in court to defend U.S. policy and to attack the evidence presented by Nicaragua. Thus, Judge Jennings later stated in his dissent that the nonappearance of the United States has been particularly unfortunate—perhaps not least for the United States—in a case which involves complicated questions of fact; where, in the merits phase, witnesses giving evidence as to the facts were called and examined by counsel for the Applicant, but their evidence was not tested by cross-examination by counsel for the Respondent; and where the Respondent itself provided neither oral nor documentary evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The application of Article 53 of the Statute in the Nicaragua case effectively served to highlight the importance of the Court's handling of facts. The Court was required to deal with this extraordinarily complex evidence entirely on its own, responding to the arguments and evidence presented by Nicaragua with its own questions (and, in particular, the detailed and painstaking examination from the bench of Judge Schwebel). Moreover—and perhaps just because the respondent United States was absent—the Court was obliged to theorize more than it would normally have done to justify the positions it ultimately took on matters of evidence. Rules of evidence were formulated that would clearly not have been necessary had the United States been in the courtroom to defend itself and to assist the Court in evaluating and disposing of the factual assertions made by Nicaragua.'</blockquote>"

The fall of the Somoza regime marked the beginning of a period of intense political and military struggle in the region.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - U.S. involvement and its implications on the Nicaraguan conflict</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'From the early 1980s, the United States began to provide substantial support to the Contras, a rebel group opposed to the Sandinista government. This support included financial aid, military training, and the provision of arms. The U.S. justified its involvement by claiming it was necessary to prevent the spread of communism in Central America.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The U.S. support for the Contras has been a subject of international controversy, with numerous debates over the legality and morality of such actions. Critics argue that the U.S. intervention violated international law and exacerbated the conflict, leading to increased violence and instability in the region.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The impact of the Sandinista policies on the conflict</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The policies implemented by the Sandinista government, including land reforms and the nationalization of industries, were aimed at reducing economic inequalities and improving social welfare. However, these policies also led to internal dissent and were met with resistance from various factions within Nicaragua, further fueling the conflict.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5,6 - The regional and international dimensions of the Nicaragua conflict</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The conflict in Nicaragua had significant regional implications, affecting neighboring countries such as Honduras and Costa Rica. The instability in Nicaragua led to an influx of refugees and increased tensions along the borders, drawing these countries into the conflict.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Internationally, the conflict drew the attention of various global powers and international organizations. The United Nations and the Organization of American States were involved in attempts to mediate and resolve the conflict, highlighting its importance on the international stage.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 7,8 - The evolution of the conflict and its long-term implications</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Over the years, the conflict in Nicaragua evolved, with shifts in power dynamics and changing strategies by both the Sandinista government and the Contras. Despite numerous attempts at negotiation and peace agreements, the conflict persisted, leading to prolonged periods of violence and uncertainty.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The long-term implications of the Nicaragua conflict are still felt today. The years of violence and instability have had lasting effects on the country's political, economic, and social fabric, shaping its current state and influencing its future trajectory.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)'</blockquote>"

There will doubtless be substantial critical comment about the Court's method: about what will be termed the use of bold inferences and heroic assumptions in Nicaragua's favor, where (it will be alleged) such assumptions and inferences were not justified by the \"actual\" situation. Yet this article cannot purport to be a considered evaluation of the accuracy or correctness of the Court's findings in Nicaragua; it can only report the Court's method, as chronicled somewhat laboriously by the Court itself.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Emphasis on key points regarding Court's decision and method</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Three points, however, should be specifically emphasized. First: not all the favorable inferences were made in favor of Nicaragua; some were favorable to the United States and contrary to Nicaragua. Second: it would be a bad mistake to evaluate the decision in the Nicaragua case without recognizing that it also represents the most dramatic and serious instance of nonappearance (or disappearance) of a party ever to confront the Court, and to forget the overall implications of the Court's duty to proceed under Article 53 in such a complex factual case.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The third point flows directly from the second: what other result could really have been anticipated, once the United States had deliberately chosen to dissociate itself from the merits of the case? Even if the Court's decision on the merits may be open to criticism, was the Court not—in essence—forced into an impossible corner by the respondent's absence from the proceedings?'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Admissions and their significance in the case</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'In the Nicaragua case, the Court, forced as it was to evaluate matters without the respondent's advancing opposing evidence or cross-examining the applicant's witnesses, arrived at a process of taking at face value the public statements of high officials when those statements were arguably made against the legal interest of the state in whose government the officials served. This was mainly applied, but was not limited to, the respondent United States; it was also applied to Nicaraguan officials.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Use of statements by representatives of states</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The material before the Court also includes statements by representatives of States, sometimes at the highest political level. Some of these statements were made before official organs of the State or of an international or regional organization, and appear in the official records.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Nonappearance and its impact on the Court's handling of facts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The decision of the United States to boycott the proceedings therefore may well have blown up in its face. As Judge Sir Robert Jennings stated in his dissenting opinion: [O]ne is bound to observe that here, where questions of fact may be every bit as important as the law, the United States can hardly complain at the inevitable consequences of its failure to plead during the substantive phase of the case. It is true that a great volume of material about the facts was provided to the Court by the United States during the earlier phases of the case. Yet a party which fails at the material stage to appear and expound and explain even the material that it has already provided, inevitably prejudices the appreciation and assessment of the facts of the case.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Much of the difficulty that resulted from the nonappearance of the United States in the merits phase of the Nicaragua case is in fact attributable to the lack of an advocate in court to defend U.S. policy and to attack the evidence presented by Nicaragua. Thus, Judge Jennings later stated in his dissent that the nonappearance of the United States has been particularly unfortunate—perhaps not least for the United States—in a case which involves complicated questions of fact; where, in the merits phase, witnesses giving evidence as to the facts were called and examined by counsel for the Applicant, but their evidence was not tested by cross-examination by counsel for the Respondent; and where the Respondent itself provided neither oral nor documentary evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - The Court's reliance on public statements and indirect evidence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The application of Article 53 of the Statute in the Nicaragua case effectively served to highlight the importance of the Court's handling of facts. The Court was required to deal with this extraordinarily complex evidence entirely on its own, responding to the arguments and evidence presented by Nicaragua with its own questions (and, in particular, the detailed and painstaking examination from the bench of Judge Schwebel). Moreover—and perhaps just because the respondent United States was absent—the Court was obliged to theorize more than it would normally have done to justify the positions it ultimately took on matters of evidence. Rules of evidence were formulated that would clearly not have been necessary had the United States been in the courtroom to defend itself and to assist the Court in evaluating and disposing of the factual assertions made by Nicaragua.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 9,10 - Evaluation of the Court's handling of factual evidence and precedents</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Nicaragua case comes closest to the Corfu Channel case in number of witnesses and scope of testimony. There were five witnesses before the Court, and no experts. Owing to the absence of the United States from this phase of the proceedings, it was not possible to refine the testimony of the witnesses or for the Court to benefit from even the rudimentary form of cross-examination that had taken place in earlier cases. However, the Court and the judges tried to fill the gap.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Questions were put by Members of the Court to the witnesses, as well as to the Agent and counsel of Nicaragua, and replies were given either orally at the hearing or subsequently in writing. On 14 October 1985 the Court requested Nicaragua to make available certain further information and documents, and one Member of the Court put a question to Nicaragua.'</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Introduction to the implications of the Nicaragua decision on international law</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Nicaragua case may have a significant impact on international law. By adjudicating the dispute and delivering a judgment, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has not only addressed the specific issues at hand but also set precedents that may influence future cases and the development of international legal principles.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - The principle of non-intervention and its reinforcement</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'One of the key implications of the Nicaragua decision is the reinforcement of the principle of non-intervention. The Court's judgment emphasizes the illegality of actions that constitute intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign states, thereby strengthening this fundamental tenet of international law.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Furthermore, the ICJ's interpretation of the principle of non-intervention in the context of the Nicaragua case provides clarity on what constitutes unlawful intervention, setting a clear standard for future international conduct. This interpretation may serve as a deterrent against such actions by other states.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The impact on the use of force and self-defense</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Nicaragua decision also has significant implications for the use of force and the right to self-defense under international law. The Court's findings on these matters contribute to the ongoing discourse on the legal parameters of these concepts, particularly in relation to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.' (Highet, 1987, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5,6 - Customary international law and its development</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Another important aspect of the Nicaragua decision is its contribution to the development of customary international law. By addressing the customary international law principles separate from treaty obligations, the ICJ has provided guidance on the formation and application of customary norms.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The decision illustrates the Court's role in shaping customary international law, particularly through its interpretation of state practice and opinio juris. This aspect of the judgment is likely to influence how customary international law is understood and applied in future cases.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 7,8 - The role of the International Court of Justice in dispute resolution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Nicaragua case underscores the pivotal role of the International Court of Justice in the peaceful resolution of disputes. By rendering a judgment in this complex case, the ICJ has demonstrated its capacity to adjudicate contentious issues between states, thus reinforcing its authority and legitimacy in the international legal system.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Court's handling of the Nicaragua case also highlights the challenges it faces in such proceedings, particularly when one party chooses not to participate. The implications of this aspect of the case are significant for the procedural aspects of international adjudication and the Court's ability to deliver fair and just decisions.' (Highet, 1987, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 9 - Broader implications for international legal order</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Overall, the Nicaragua decision has broader implications for the international legal order. It reinforces the rule of law at the international level, promoting adherence to legal norms and principles among states. This, in turn, contributes to the maintenance of international peace and security.' (Highet, 1987, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 10,11 - Conclusion and future outlook</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'In conclusion, the Nicaragua decision is a landmark judgment with far-reaching implications for international law. Its impact on the principles of non-intervention, the use of force, self-defense, and customary international law will likely be felt for years to come.' (Highet, 1987, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'As the international community continues to evolve, the precedents set by the Nicaragua case will play a crucial role in shaping the future of international legal norms and the functioning of the International Court of Justice.' (Highet, 1987, p. 5)</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Review of the Court's practice in matters of evidence and proof</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This general review of the practice of the Court in matters of evidence and proof suggests some general conclusions about its powers and experience.' (Highet, 1987, p. 46)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Issues of nonappearance and their impact on the Court</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Court stated the paradox as follows: While these are the guiding principles, the experience of previous cases in which one party has decided not to appear shows that something more is involved. Though formally absent from the proceedings, the party in question frequently submits to the Court letters and documents, in ways and by means not contemplated by the Rules. The Court has thus to strike a balance. On the one hand, it is valuable for the Court to know the views of both parties in whatever form those views may have been expressed. . . . On the other hand, the Court has to emphasize that the equality of the parties to the dispute must remain the basic principle for the Court. The intention of Article 53 was that in a case of non-appearance neither party should be placed at a disadvantage; therefore the party which declines to appear cannot be permitted to profit from its absence, since this would amount to placing the party appearing at a disadvantage.' (Highet, 1987, p. 46)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The effect of the \"illegal\" provenance of evidence is also of interest. The Court in the Corfu Channel case was confronted with what it determined to be a violation of international law by the United Kingdom: \"Operation Retail,\" a minesweeping operation undertaken in Albanian territorial waters without Albania's consent. Yet evidence resulting from that operation was taken into account by the Court. While finding that the United Kingdom had not acted in accordance with international law as far as its incursive minesweep was concerned, the Court avoided considering specifically that such evidence would be \"inadmissible\" under some theory akin to the exclusion of evidence on constitutional grounds in U.S. municipal law, and permitted its use.' (Highet, 1987, p. 47)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The Court's reliance on inferential methods in factual conclusions</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Traditionally, the Court has operated in important areas of factual conclusions by an informed process of inference. The inferential method may be \"negative,\" in that it seeks to conclude about a state of affairs because of a failure to deny or rebut it. Thus, what is not denied may well be accepted: for example, overflights by U.S. military aircraft in the Nicaragua case.' (Highet, 1987, p. 47)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5,6 - Examples of inferential reasoning in the Nicaragua case</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'What is asserted, but only partially contradicted, may be found to be partially valid: for example, the partial negation of the U.S. allegation that Nicaragua had been supplying arms to the Salvadoran opposition, and the partial rebuttal of allegations concerning border incidents involving Honduras and Costa Rica. A more sophisticated variation on the Court's use of inference is exemplified by the significant conclusion drawn in the Nicaragua case that the United States could not have considered Nicaragua to have been engaged in an \"armed attack\" properly giving rise to the collective right of self-defense because the United States had not complied with the requirements of Article 51 governing the exercise of such a right. A similar inference was applied to El Salvador.' (Highet, 1987, p. 47)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The hierarchy appears to be substantially as follows: (1) uncontrovertible matters of public knowledge (matters that are notorious or universally known) as to which the Court can in effect take \"judicial notice\"; (2) statements made by high officials of the government(s) concerned \"against interest\" in the context of the case at hand, from which inferences can be drawn or which, taken at face value, confirm the state's responsibility for subsequent events presumed to be the reasonably likely consequence of the intention imparted by the statement; and (3) press statements of facts against the interest of the state concerned, which are not controverted or denied by responsible officials.' (Highet, 1987, p. 47-48)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - The Court's approach to ongoing or fluid situations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Finally, there has been much discussion of late about what has been termed \"ongoing\" or \"fluid\" factual situations, also involving \"armed conflict.\" The assertion is made that these are inherently \"unsuitable for judicial determination,\" and that the evidence produced in connection with them is intrinsically unmanageable or inappropriate for the Court's consideration. The question seems to boil down to the proposition that fluid or ongoing situations are unsuitable for adjudication since their factual matrix is fluid and constantly changing. The Court in its Judgment on jurisdiction and admissibility in the Nicaragua case responded to this point in part, in terms of the preponderance of the actual evidence and the burden of proof.' (Highet, 1987, p. 48)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 8,9 - The Court's reassurance on justiciability of armed conflict cases</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Court stated: [A]ny judgment on the merits in the present case will be limited to upholding such submissions of the Parties as have been supported by sufficient proof of relevant facts, and are regarded by the Court as sound in law. A situation of armed conflict is not the only one in which evidence of fact may be difficult to come by, and the Court has in the past recognized and made allowance for this (Corfu Channel, I.CJ. Reports 1949, p. 18; United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, I.CJ. Reports 1980, p. 10, para. 13). Ultimately, however, it is the litigant seeking to establish a fact that bears the burden of proving it; and in cases where evidence may not be forthcoming, a submission may in the judgment be rejected as unproved, but is not to be ruled out as inadmissible in limine on the basis of an anticipated lack of proof.' (Highet, 1987, p. 48-49)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Ever since the arguments on admissibility in the jurisdictional phase of the Nicaragua case, the United States has also laid great stress on the proposition that the Court was never intended to handle matters involving \"ongoing armed conflict.\" In view particularly of the requirement of Article 53 that the applicant's case be well founded in law, the Court in the Nicaragua case went out of its way to reassure itself that the case as presented to it by the end of the oral proceedings was not nonjusticiable on the ground that it related to an \"ongoing armed conflict\"; the Court held that the factual issues and legal conclusions to be drawn did not \"necessarily involve [the Court] in any evaluation of military considerations.\"' (Highet, 1987, p. 49)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 10,11 - The broader impact of the nonappearance technique and institutional hope</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The \"no-appearance technique\" of litigation will be placed in a new, sharp and critical light. The Nicaragua case dramatizes the profound consequences and implications of the nonappearance (more properly, disappearance) of the United States, and any subsequent refusal by it to comply with the Judgment. This can become a life-threatening event for a fragile institution such as the Court. Yet this strategy may also backfire: the \"no-appearance technique\" of litigation may suffer a setback, once its absurdity and overall uselessness are correctly perceived. Likewise, overt defiance of the Court by a great power over a case won by a small one may prove to be an unattractive example—a disincentive—for other states. It is hard to complain with Goliath after he has been trounced by David.' (Highet, 1987, p. 49)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The destruction or weakening of the Court does not appear to be as sure a thing as its opponents are bound to announce. This writer hopes that precisely the opposite effect will be experienced. As was pointed out above, many of the classic anodynes for improving the Court's functioning are now beginning to materialize one way or another, perhaps in reaction to Nicaragua and perhaps merely by coincidence. In any event, the negative forces undermining the progressive development of international law—nonproduction, noncooperation and nonappearance—which, like Antaeus, might at first appear to be gaining renewed strength from both the 1985 withdrawal of the United States and the likely long-term response by the United States and others to the Court's Nicaragua decision in 1986, will now be seen for what they are.' (Highet, 1987, p. 49-50)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 12 - The final outlook and Pascal's wager on the Court's future</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It is therefore not entirely vain naivete to hope that some institutional good may come out of the extraordinarily difficult situation from which the Court is just now emerging. That hope may be expressed as a variant of Pascal's wager: it is better to believe in the Court than not to believe in the Court, since, if the Court does emerge as an effective institution, one's belief and conviction will have been vindicated; whereas, if the Court falls upon increasingly difficult times, then it will not matter much what one believed. The Court may well continue to have more to do—not less—as a result of Nicaragua. At least, it will certainly have more facts to determine and it will have to continue to \"\r\n\r\nperform that task with exacting care.\" It is hoped that its use and determination of facts and evidence will grow in strength and depth as a result of, and not in spite of, the Nicaragua decision of 1986, where much of the Court's careful and painstaking work was rendered difficult beyond description by the absence of the respondent.' (Highet, 1987, p. 50)</blockquote>"

In this article, we will discuss the application of digital evidence in cyber law with reference to information technology law.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Scope of Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'According to this law it defines \"DIGITAL EVIDENCE\" as an \"ELECTRONIC RECORD\" as data, images or sound stored, received or transmitted, recorded or transmitted or generated in electronic form or on microfilm or computer-generated microfilm. This includes electronic communications, images, videos, recordings, social media posts and computer files. In cyber law cases, digital evidence is often used to prove a suspect's identity, establish a timeline of events and prove the nature and extent of a crime.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Legal Framework and Recognition of Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The use of digital evidence in cyber law is becoming increasingly important as more and more criminal activity takes place online.

The potential for prosecuting such operations, particularly those causing loss of life or significant physical damage, is a central theme.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'This article examines how a cyber-operation that has consequences similar to a kinetic or physical attack — causing serious loss of life or physical damage — could be encompassed within the crimes prosecuted before the International Criminal Court (ICC).' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'While a full explanation of every element of every crime is beyond the scope of this article, the author will set forth some initial observations on the characteristics of cyber-operations which might amount to Rome Statute crimes, while acknowledging some limiting factors.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h4>Finding 2: The complexity of attributing cyber-operations poses significant challenges for ICC prosecution.</h4>\r\n  <p>The research highlights the difficulties in proving attribution of cyber-operations to specific actors due to the intricate nature of cyber evidence and the requirement for admissible proof that meets the threshold of 'beyond a reasonable doubt'.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Proof of attribution for the purpose of state responsibility would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence that establishes proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The OTP would need to develop significant technical expertise as would, eventually, Chambers, Defense counsel, and other participants in the ICC judicial process.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h4>Finding 3: Legal and technical challenges need to be addressed for prosecuting cyber-operations under the Rome Statute.</h4>\r\n  <p>The study identifies several legal and technical hurdles that must be overcome to effectively prosecute cyber-operations under the Rome Statute, including issues related to jurisdiction, evidence, and the gravity threshold of crimes.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Part 4 then provides an overview of how certain cyber-operations could fall within the Rome Statute’s substantive crimes.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'This article suggests that each of the crimes in the ICC’s Rome Statute — war crimes, crimes again humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression — can be applied at least to a limited subset of cyber-operations.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h4>Finding 4: Limited application of Rome Statute crimes to cyber-operations is feasible without amendments.</h4>\r\n  <p>The research concludes that existing provisions of the Rome Statute can encompass a limited subset of cyber-operations, negating the immediate need for amendments to include such operations explicitly.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area. An added benefit is that such prosecutions may occur without any amendment to the Rome Statute, as at least this limited subset of cyber-operations is covered under its existing provisions.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Communicating this by the ICC, and/or pursuing cases that fall within that limited subset, could be important in conveying that states may not achieve through cyber means what would be Rome Statute crimes if committed through kinetic/conventional means.'

The complexity of cyber evidence and the high standard of proof required at the International Criminal Court (ICC) are major limitations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'An additional limiting factor (relevant for all ICC crimes) would be that all the elements of the crime would need to be proven through admissible evidence that could eventually satisfy the requirement at trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'For Rome Statute purposes, proof of attribution would need to be demonstrated through admissible evidence and this will require authentication; moreover, simply assembling a cyber-case would be extremely complex.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 2: Jurisdictional Challenges under the Rome Statute</h3>\r\n  <p>The study highlights the restrictive jurisdictional limitations of the Rome Statute, particularly in relation to the crime of aggression, which poses a challenge for prosecuting cyber-operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'As to the crime of aggression, the jurisdictional limitations appear to be so restrictive that it may be difficult to satisfy jurisdiction (absent Security Council referral) even if the gravity threshold were met.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Because there hopefully will be few, if any, cyber-operations rising to the level of Rome Statute gravity and satisfying the elements of the crimes, the ICC’s docket should not be significantly impacted.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 10)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 3: The Rome Statute's Gravity Threshold</h3>\r\n  <p>The gravity threshold for crimes under the Rome Statute is another limitation, as many cyber-operations may not meet this threshold, thus excluding them from ICC jurisdiction.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'It is worth noting that even loss of life (if there are a limited number of fatalities) would not necessarily reach the ICC’s gravity threshold.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes that are occurring (such as data theft or extortion) — as it would only cover a limited subset of cyber-operations such as those inflicting serious loss of life or significant physical damage — the Rome Statute does have potential for use in this area.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 2)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Shortcoming 4: Potential for Unintended Consequences and Limitations of Intent Requirement</h3>\r\n  <p>The document points out the difficulty in addressing unintended consequences of cyber-operations and the stringent intent requirements under the Rome Statute, which may limit the prosecution of certain cyber-crimes.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Given that several cyber-operations to date have proliferated well-beyond their intended targets, another question is whether the Rome Statute would have any applicability for unintended results.' (J Trahan, 2021, p. 6)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The requirements in Article 30 of ‘intent’ and ‘knowledge’ could prove an additional limiting factor, excluding criminal responsibility for unforeseeable results and setting a high standard as to foreseeable results, requiring “virtual certainty” of the consequences.'

While this article is a conversation starter and does not contain a comprehensive discussion of all the elements of the crimes, or all potential cyber-operations that might fit within their ambit, it provides an overview of when and how a cyber-operation could constitute genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or the crime of aggression. It includes the potential for prosecuting both state actors (e.g. those within cyber-command structures, armed forces, or intelligence agencies) and non-state actors (cyber-criminals or informal bands of hackers).' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Recognizing limitations and potential deterrence through prosecution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, meet the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Recognition that cyber-operations can, in certain circumstances, constitute Rome Statute crimes could additionally help align the ICC’s work with one of the newer challenges facing the international community in the 21st century — thereby re-affirming the relevance of the Court in a way that may not have been previously envisioned. For states that have implemented Rome Statute crimes into their domestic criminal laws, the potential for additional deterrence could be created through the use of such laws — recognizing that such legislation could be broader in scope, as it would not need to be bound to the ICC’s definitions of crimes nor by its jurisdictional limitations. While the Rome Statute admittedly would not encompass the vast number of cyber-crimes' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5,6 - Definitions and scope of cyber-operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'‘Cyber-operation’ is a broad term indicating the employment of cyber-capabilities aimed at achieving its objectives in and through cyber-space. This article focuses on a narrow subset of cyber-operations that are harmful or malicious, particularly ones that could involve large-scale loss of life, or damage to, or destruction of, property. The term ‘cyber-attack’ might also be used, although the author does not do so here, as that term risks conflation with an ‘attack’ under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or an ‘armed attack’ under jus ad bellum.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Additionally, the article acknowledges some of the limitations on the prosecution of cyber-operations, such as the Rome Statute’s gravity threshold as well as the potential difficulty of attributing conduct to a particular suspect through admissible evidence that could, at trial, meet the threshold of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding these limitations, increased awareness of the potential of the Rome Statute to encompass certain cyber-operations could contribute to deterring the commission of crimes by these means, as would actual prosecution(s) by the ICC, were the necessary requirements met.'

Cyber-operations can be harmful by their nature (e.g. employing some form of malware) or because of their content (e.g. disinformation or misinformation campaigns or hate speech). Cyber-operations have sometimes proliferated beyond their originally intended targets to impacting information technology (IT) systems around the globe. To date, fortunately, cyber-operations have not resulted in widespread devastation that has caused loss of life, and, to the extent physical damage has resulted, it has been mostly to data, computer hardware and software, or, in one instance, centrifuges at a nuclear facility (the Stuxnet attack). Cyber-operations have also caused massive economic loss and compromised the personal information of millions of individuals.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Potential catastrophic consequences of future cyber-operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The use of cyber-technology to date, however, makes clear that a much more catastrophic cyber-operation could occur. States are increasingly developing and utilizing cyber-weaponry as a means of warfare, and may combine cyber-weapons with conventional weapons in a ‘blended attack’.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 3, 4 - Historical examples of blended attacks and potential future threats</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Such a ‘blended attack’ occurred in Ukraine, where both physical/kinetic military operations as well as cyber-operation by the [Russian-affiliated] hacker team known as ‘Sandworm’ (also known as ‘Voodoo Bear’ and ‘Telebots’) hacked into dozens of Ukrainian governmental organizations and companies. The 2008 attack on Georgia was also ‘blended’. War crimes that could be committed during a conventional armed conflict could potentially also be committed through cyber means, or by employing both cyber and conventional weapons. Outside a state of armed conflict, cyber-operations meeting the requirements of, inter alia, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population could fall within the ambit of ‘crimes against humanity’. Here, one need only to realize that by disabling air-traffic controls, the capability exists to cause a ‘cyber 9/11’, perpetrated, for example, by non-state actors (cyber-criminals or bands of hackers).' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'A cyber-operation could similarly target computer systems that control critical or safety–critical infrastructure such as train traffic, nuclear facilities, hospitals, power grids, or a dam located upstream from a major city. One can imagine a long list of such targets that could be manipulated by a cyber-operation to cause serious loss of life and/or physical destruction. It is this limited subset of cyber-operations, carrying potentially grave consequences — rather than the vast number of cyber-crimes being perpetrated for pure financial gain — that this article addresses.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The complexity of applying International Criminal Law (ICL) to cyber-operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Applying ICL to information and communication technologies (ICTs), in particular to cyber-operations, is complex. Cyber-operations have unique characteristics that distinguish them from traditional physical attacks, including their intangibility, the speed at which they can occur, the difficulty of attribution, and the potential for significant harm even when conducted from a distance. These characteristics pose challenges for the existing legal frameworks, which were primarily designed to address kinetic forms of warfare.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The relevance of the Rome Statute to cyber-operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Despite these challenges, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) does provide a potential framework for addressing certain cyber-operations. The Statute defines crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, and it is possible to conceive of cyber-operations that could fall within these definitions. For example, a cyber-operation that causes significant harm to a civilian population could potentially be prosecuted as a crime against humanity or a war crime, depending on the context in which it occurs.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Rome Statute's applicability to cyber-operations is not without its limitations. One significant limitation is the gravity threshold that must be met for the ICC to take jurisdiction over a case. This threshold requires that the crime be of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. Given the wide range of cyber-operations and their varying impacts, not all cyber-operations would meet this threshold. However, those that result in substantial harm or disruption could potentially be considered.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Issues of attribution and evidence in prosecuting cyber-operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution is another major challenge in the application of ICL to cyber-operations. Determining who is responsible for a cyber-operation can be difficult, as cyber-attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, often using techniques to obscure the origin of the attack. This poses significant challenges for gathering admissible evidence that can be used to meet the burden of proof in a court of law.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Moreover, the requirement for proving intent and knowledge adds another layer of complexity. For a cyber-operation to be prosecuted under the Rome Statute, it must be shown that the perpetrator had the necessary intent and knowledge regarding the consequences of their actions. This can be particularly challenging in the cyber realm, where actions can have unintended and far-reaching effects.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6, 7, 8 - Potential for cyber-operations to be prosecuted as traditional crimes under the Rome Statute</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Nevertheless, there is potential for certain cyber-operations to be prosecuted as traditional crimes under the Rome Statute. For instance, a cyber-operation that targets critical infrastructure, leading to significant loss of life or destruction, could be seen as a form of warfare or even genocide, depending on the context and intent behind the attack.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Cyber-operations that aim to instill fear or coerce a population, such as those that disrupt essential services or spread false information to create panic, could also fall within the ambit of crimes against humanity. The key is to assess each cyber-operation on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific circumstances and impacts.' (Trahan, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The integration of cyber-operations into the framework of ICL is an evolving area of law. As cyber capabilities continue to develop and become more sophisticated, it is likely that legal frameworks will also need to adapt. This includes considering amendments to existing statutes or developing new legal instruments specifically tailored to address the unique challenges posed by cyber-operations.'

For example, a state can deny responsibility for exploitation of vulnerabilities even if the victim state can use forensic techniques to ascertain the origin of the act. Denial is possible because of the infrastructure of cyberspace, which allows cyber operators to conduct cyber operations in relative anonymity. Technology allows cyber perpetrators to mask their identity and make identification of the act, actor, and any state sponsor, very difficult.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Challenges of Attribution in Cyberspace</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Because of the nature of cyberspace, attribution, which is “the action of regarding something as being caused by a person or thing,” hostile or malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the “underlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.”7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is “more nuanced, more common, and more political” than these assumptions allow.10' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Though technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action is taken.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>"

This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Principles of DoD Law of War and Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States works with the international community to apply existing international laws and the principles of the law of war to cyber operations. Specific international laws may apply to cyber operations even though the laws were created before cyberspace became a domain. Therefore, terminology as it relates to cyberspace continues to develop. However, there are certain terms that require definitions that relate specifically to cyber operations to understand the context better and threshold required for responses. For example, the term cyberattack has been used to describe “hostile or malicious cyber activities, such as the defacement of websites, network intrusions, the theft of private information, or the disruption of the provision of Internet services.” When applying principles of the law of war, these types of cyber activities, though hostile or malicious in nature, do not meet the threshold of an “armed attack” or allow for a state to declare a response in self-defense under international law. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, the definition for cyberattacks under Joint Publication 3-12 will be used. Joint Publication 3-12 defines cyberattacks as “cyberspace actions that create various direct denial effects in cyberspace (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) and manipulation that leads to denial that is hidden or that manifests in the physical domains.” Defining cyber acts as cyberattacks versus other activities, such as cyber exploitations, is important because of the distinction made under international law and the threshold required to meet this definition. Though similar, cyber exploitations are acts directed at retrieving information whereas cyberattacks are acts directed at “disrupting or destroying” a physical system.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In determining whether to hold a state or nonstate actor accountable for a malicious cyber act, international law should recognize that in addition to technological means, nation states should also consider other factors, such as human factors. This recognition would acknowledge the challenges inherent to cyber technology while explicitly recognizing the relevance of a more comprehensive framework of accountability for holding other nation states or nonstate actors responsible for cyber transgressions.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Challenges of Attribution and Need for Multi-Dimensional Approach</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The challenges of attribution inherent in cyberspace and the requirement implicit in international law regarding knowledge of the source of a hostile act before responding to it, and recognition under international law of a multi-dimensional approach would provide the victim states of cyber acts greater clarity on the standard that the international community accepts in determining an appropriate course of action.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In unclassified sources, researchers have mostly concentrated on the technical aspects of attribution and the technology available to find certain information, such as the machine or network used in a cyber operation. The geographical area in which the cyber operation occurred, or the types of cyber operations used; however, are left largely unexplored, as are other types of information that should be considered legitimate in ascertaining any source’s responsibility for a cyber act.'

Specific international laws may apply to cyber operations even though the laws were created before cyberspace became a domain. Therefore, terminology as it relates to cyberspace continues to develop. However, there are certain terms that require definitions that relate specifically to cyber operations to understand the context better and threshold required for responses. For example, the term cyberattack has been used to describe “hostile or malicious cyber activities, such as the defacement of websites, network intrusions, the theft of private information, or the disruption of the provision of Internet services.” When applying principles of the law of war, these types of cyber activities, though hostile or malicious in nature, do not meet the threshold of an “armed attack” or allow for a state to declare a response in self-defense under international law. Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, the definition for cyberattacks under Joint Publication 3-12 will be used. Joint Publication 3-12 defines cyberattacks as “cyberspace actions that create various direct denial effects in cyberspace (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) and manipulation that leads to denial that is hidden or that manifests in the physical domains.” Defining cyber acts as cyberattacks versus other activities, such as cyber exploitations, is important because of the distinction made under international law and the threshold required to meet this definition. Though similar, cyber exploitations are acts directed at retrieving information whereas cyberattacks are acts directed at “disrupting or destroying” a physical system.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Differentiation of Cyberattacks and Cyber Exploitations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Effects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply. Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering. However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'During peacetime, collecting information through cyber operations is governed by international law. Unauthorized access to systems in an effort to gather information may or may not rise to the level of an attack, but attribution is a critical process to complete to take any action. Generally, attribution of cyber operations is difficult because of the nature of cyberspace and the ability of adversaries to deny responsibility of an act. Even if the act can be attributed to a particular computer or network, a state can deny involvement or knowledge of the incident. Furthermore, through the interconnected nature of cyberspace, a neutral state that was not party to an incident may be implicated in an act because the act was perpetrated through the neutral state’s cyber infrastructure. This is an example of where other factors would be helpful in determining attribution and the responsibility of the act. In a case where a “neutral state” was implicated in a cyber act against a victim state, allowing a victim state to take into consideration the political climate and attitude by the “neutral state” toward that victim state would be probative information in determining the perpetrator of the act.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Principles of Law of Armed Conflict in Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The cyber operations discussed in the DoD Law of War Manual pertain to operations that are defined in the context of acts of war. Cyber operations that constitute a cyberattack are those that meet military objectives and would cause a specific type of harm, such as loss of life, significant injury to civilians, or substantial damage. The DoD Law of War Manual does not provide examples of cyber operations that would constitute a cyberattack; however, it does provide examples of cyber operations that would not constitute a cyberattack. Cyber operations that do not meet the threshold of the definition of cyberattack include, but are not limited to: defacing a government webpage, minor disruption of the Internet, or network services, minor communication interference or disruption, and disseminating propaganda.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution and the Law of Armed Conflict “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the LOAC to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.” The LOAC provides guidance on the use of force necessary to invoke a nation’s right to self-defense. A certain level of response to a cyber act is dependent upon meeting the threshold of the “use of force” under LOAC. Cyber activities have been characterized in three ways: (1) cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the state’s ability to respond with a use of force; (2) cyber activities that are equivalent to the threshold to respond with a use of force, but do not meet the threshold of an “armed attack;” and (3) cyber activities that are equal to an armed attack. As defined above, cyberattacks that are considered armed attacks must produce consequences equivalent to a physical attack that causes destruction of property, grave injury, and death. “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>"

Conversely, actions of private citizens are not attributable to states under international law. The process of attribution for non-state actors depends upon the ability to prove that a relationship exists between the non-state actor committing an internationally unlawful act and the potential perpetrating state. To further complicate the pursuit of attribution, some non-state actors employ malicious cyber acts that do not meet the threshold of an “armed attack” under LOAC. These non-state actors also do not fall under the guidance presented in the Tallinn Manual in support of their nation-state or their political objectives. With various factors associated with the actor, as well as the low cost of committing cyber acts, the accessibility of the Internet, and the anonymity inherent in cyberspace, establishing a connection between a state and a non-state actor can be formidable.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Differentiation between International and Non-International Armed Conflict</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'LOAC distinguishes between international armed conflict between states and non-international conflict between a state and non-state actors, such as an organized group. Attribution in these cases is critical because of the ability of victim states to respond with the use of force against the state or non-state actors. Additionally, attribution is critical because, if the support of non-state actors by a perpetrating state can be established and meet the elements of proof that make the act attributable to the perpetrating state, then the cyber act can rise to the level of international conflict under LOAC. Further, evidence that other states supported non-state actors in another territory in the pursuit of a cyber act that meets the threshold of an armed attack can “internationalize” a conflict that was considered a non-international armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors. Support of other states is legally significant because the rules under international law then apply to an armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The difference between establishing state responsibility and a non-international armed conflict becoming “internationalized” is that the “sponsoring state exercises ‘overall control’ over an organized armed group.” Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a non-state actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group’s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state’s military objectives. The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states. Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors. “By this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group’s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.”' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Higher Level of Control in Non-International Armed Conflict</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It is important to note the distinction between the non-international armed conflict between a state and an organized armed group of non-state actors with an unorganized individual or group of individual non-state actors. In the instance of a cyber act between a victim state and an unorganized group of individual non-state actors, international law requires the perpetrating state to have a much higher level of control before the act would rise to the level of an international armed conflict between two states. The state would have to direct the non-state actor(s) in perpetrating a cyber act that would reach the threshold of an armed attack under international law against another state’s cyber infrastructure to classify the act as an international armed conflict. There have been insufficient cases in which cyber acts that did not meet the threshold of an armed attack were considered to be at the level of an international armed conflict between two states.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Though the complexity of cyberspace can afford states with the ability to use covert means to pursue national security objectives through non-state actors, placing a state with culpability must occur for international law to apply. Though debatable, the reason may be that international law does not provide specific guidance for cyber acts reaching the degree of an armed attack under international law to non-state actors without the involvement of a perpetrating state in the act. As described in detail in the above sections, state responsibility must be justified, and there is guidance as to what constitutes a state’s responsibility for an armed attack. However, when a group or an individual not associated with a state commits an act, the victim state cannot rely on the provisions in international law to respond with use of force or self-defense unless the act is attributed to a state.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Introduction to the Tallinn Manual</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations. The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace. It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the “cyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.” The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state’s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state’s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state. In the case of non- state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state. One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non- state actor in collusion with a state is that “cyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.”' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Criteria for Use of Force in Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Rule 11 in the Tallinn Manual states that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non- cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” The United Nations Charter does not provide any criteria on the threshold of the term use of force. According to the team of experts that collaborated on the Tallinn Manual, the use of force can utilize an assessment of the scale and effects to determine if the act meets an armed attack. If the scale and effects from a cyber act are similar to those of a traditional kinetic attack, then according to the Tallinn Manual, then LOAC applies. The Tallinn Manual clarifies this assessment even further by making the distinction that merely providing financial means to non- state actors that are employing cyber operations against another state does not constitute a use of force. However, if a state provides the malware and trains the non- state actors to use the malware, then that would meet the threshold of use of force. Sanctuary of non- state actors by a state or a lack of enforcement by a state to stop cyber acts that meet the threshold of use of force is not considered sufficient to attribute the state with a violation of the use of force principle.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Tallinn Manual acknowledged the lack of disparity between the definitions of use of force and armed attack, stating “the distinction between the two concepts is either so narrow as to be insignificant or non- existent.” The conclusion of this rule provided that not all cyber acts meet the threshold for use of force. The acts that do meet the threshold of use of force do not have to be directly targeted by the state; however, the Tallinn Manual further states that this issue is unresolved because it is unclear from international law what cyber acts short of armed attacks would meet the threshold of use of force. The Tallinn Manual provides probable factors that the international community may assess in determining the act’s potential for meeting the threshold of use of force. These factors include severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and state responsibility. Though not an exhaustive list, these factors provide a basic understanding as to what a state may consider when determining if the act meets the threshold of use of force.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Definitions and Ambiguities in Armed Attack</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Furthermore, the Tallinn Manual distinguishes the difference in the terms between use of force and armed attack by the United Nations Charter articles that specifically provide rules of law for acts that meet these thresholds. The distinction is important because meeting the threshold of an armed attack can allow the state to respond with force against another state under international law without violating the “prohibition on using force” against that state. If the act does not meet the threshold of an armed attack under international law, then the state cannot lawfully respond with an act that meets the threshold of use of force against the perpetrating state. The ambiguity between the terms use of force and armed attack can create difficulty for states attempting to assess these acts and respond lawfully.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In terms of defining a cyber act as an armed attack, the Tallinn Manual states that “all reasonably foreseeable consequences of the cyber operation” should be considered. For example, if a cyber act targeted a water purification plant, then any illness or death associated with the contamination of water because of that cyber act is foreseeable and would apply to the determination of categorizing the act as an “armed attack.” The Tallinn Manual concluded that the “lawfulness of the response” to the cyber act would be determined by “the reasonableness” of the state’s assessment of an armed attack. Further, it is necessary not only to consider the actor, but also whether that actor is working on behalf of a particular state for the purpose of defining an act as an armed attack. For example, an individual or group of non- state actors conducting cyber operations against a victim state that reaches the scales and effects threshold under the direction of another state would constitute an armed attack. The analysis of whether an individual or group of actors is receiving direction from another state is important because of the controversial nature of defining an act as an armed attack by non- state actors. The United Nations and LOAC are “characterized as applicable solely to armed attacks undertaken by one state against another.”' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>"

The lack of distinction in legal terms, as described above coupled with the lack of definitive evidence to attribute cyber acts to a state creates a level of difficulty that warrants legal requirements. As described in detail above, international law provides governing rules for cyberattacks that meet the threshold of an armed attack and are facilitated by a state. There is not a rule of law or legal guidance on a victim state’s rights when a group or an individual not affiliated with another state commits a hostile cyber act unless that group or individual can be linked to a perpetrating state. Despite the ability of non- state actors to perpetrate hostile cyber acts and their potential to cause political discord, as well as serious legal and political consequences, there are not any provisions within international law to regulate these actions.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Defining State and Non-State Actor Relationships</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Moreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and non- state actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non- state actor is the concept of “acting under the direction or control of a state.”140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non- state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non- state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state “must exercise effective control over the non- state actor” to be attributable to a state.142 “Effective control” has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state’s ability to prove that the non- state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'As presented, key challenges face the international community in the legal representation of cyber acts under international law. One of the main challenges in this area is that there has been difficulty in reaching a consensus across the international community on how to apply traditional laws of armed conflict to cyber acts.145 Application has led to a lack of expressed guidance in handling hostile cyber acts perpetrated by both state and non- state actors and left important questions as to how to proceed with a proportionate, distinct response. Since LOAC does not provide a sufficient definition of an “armed attack” as it relates to acts committed in cyberspace, victim states are forced to rely on their assessment of the act to articulate any response they may consider. The thresholds that exist for the attribution of states and non- state actors are very hard to reach. The more non- state actors exploit cyber vulnerabilities of victim states, the more perpetrating states may choose to support non- state actors covertly, resulting in victim states developing liberal cases for meeting those thresholds.146 The burden of proof is on the victim state in these cases, and the victim states need evidence on which to base their assessment.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Challenges and Burden of Proof for Victim States</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'If an act is attributed to a state, the victim state should determine what level of responsibility is held by the state before responding.80 For example, if a victim state is able to determine the physical location of the originating hostile or malicious cyber operation within a particular state, then the victim state must further determine the extent of the state’s knowledge of the act and the state’s willingness to allow the actor to continue with the hostile or malicious act without consequence. In this determination, the victim state must consider: the state’s ability to detect the act; the ability to enforce the prohibition of the act; the tolerance of the act; the encouragement of the act; the potential direction of the act by the state; and the probability that the state is behind the conduct of the act.81 The state may also distinguish its allowance of certain cyber operations between specific types of acts.82 For example, a state may allow certain information collection activities but prohibit any malicious cyber operations that impair other states’ systems.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Furthermore, the process of “imputed attribution” is another avenue in which a state can assert that another state is responsible for a cyber operation.83 Imputed attribution is the concept that a state can be held responsible for an individual or group’s actions because the state refuses their duty to prevent their state from being used as “a haven or sanctuary” for those responsible for malicious or hostile cyber operations.84 A state can be considered responsible through imputed attribution when the state consistently fails to impose measures to stop or prevent the individual or groups conducting the cyber operations against another state.85 However, “the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.”86 Therefore, the attribution process is crucial to proving whether or not a group or individual non- state actors have perpetrated the cyber activity alone or in collusion with the state.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - Attribution of Non-State Actors in Cyberspace</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution of non- state actors in cyberspace can be a major contention for victim states under international law. The International Law Commission’s “Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts” represents that states are responsible for “internationally wrongful acts” perpetuated against victim states. These acts have two distinctions. First, the act has to breach an international obligation and second, the act has to be attributable to a state. If a state commits an act that breaches international law, the state must immediately stop the act or comply with their legal obligation, in the case of an omission, and “make full reparation of the injured state.” Therefore, in the case of cyber acts, if the state breaches its international obligation, it is required to cease the cyber act immediately. Further, in the case of non- state actors acting on behalf of a state—in which the cyber act committed by the non- state actors is attributable to that state— the state must follow the same guidelines. If the perpetrating state does not fulfill its duty under international law, victim states may take countermeasures, which are actions “contrary to the international obligations of [an] injured state vis- à- vis the responsible state if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act . . . to procure cessation and reparation.” These countermeasures would not constitute an internationally wrongful act as long as they comply with the requirements for countermeasures under the international law of state responsibility.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Responsibility through the Non-Intervention Principle</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A state can also be found responsible for a cyber act through the “non- intervention principle,” which refers to perpetrating states compelling other states’ affairs. “The International Court of Justice has confirmed that the non- intervention principle is violated, for example, if a state provides financial support, training, a supply of weapons, intelligence, and logistic support to a terrorist or insurgent group operating in another state.” Thus, under the non- intervention principle, cyber acts that are committed by non- state actors can be attributable to a state if the state is found to have supplied malware, trained the group on how to administer the malware, and provided support in committing the act. A state may not wittingly allow using its territory to violate other states’ rights, whether the act is a traditional kinetic act or a cyber act originating in the perpetrating state’s territory. For example, a state would be responsible for shutting down a cyber act committed by non- state actors if the act violated another state’s rights. However, whether the state was responsible for the non- state actor’s act, to begin with, is a question of attribution.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Generally, the actions of a state that can be attributable to the state depend on whether the entities of the state that are dependent on the state to function are committing the acts. Conversely, actions of private citizens are not attributable to states under international law. The process of attribution for non- state actors depends upon the ability to prove that a relationship exists between the non- state actor committing an internationally unlawful act and the potential perpetrating state. To further complicate the pursuit of attribution, some non- state actors employ malicious cyber acts that do not meet the threshold of an “armed attack” under LOAC. These non- state actors also do not fall under the guidance presented in the Tallinn Manual in support of their nation- state or their political objectives. With various factors associated with the actor, as well as the low cost of committing cyber acts, the accessibility of the Internet, and the anonymity inherent in cyberspace, establishing a connection between a state and a non- state actor can be formidable.'

The argument is that these same concepts can apply to any domain; however, the new form of warfare in cyberspace does not necessarily fit the traditional kinetic principles of LOAC. For example, a cyber act that shuts down a power grid without causing any physical damage to the structure would not necessarily meet the threshold of a cyberattack; however, a bomb that accomplished the same thing would meet that threshold and provide that state with the ability to defend its self under LOAC. An armed attack typically requires a higher threshold to legitimize the use of force in self- defense under LOAC.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The issue is how to apply this higher threshold in cyber operations when there is ambiguity in the definitions of these thresholds. Furthermore, the current international law provisions do not address the non-physical effects that cyber acts can have and do not provide sufficient laws for the effect that cyber acts can have over time. These effects, not unlike traditional kinetic effects, can have significant consequences to the sovereignty of a state; however, under LOAC, they fail to meet the threshold of use of force or armed attack. “The physical damage or harm requirement is only appropriate in a kinetic context, where it is easier to discern when there are kinetic weapons involved.” With the problem of attribution in cyberspace, “physical harm or damage presents a more attenuated, proximate cause rather than a direct cause.” Then in the context of LOAC, states may not suffer traditional kinetic acts through the principle of distinction but are subject to cyber acts that affect civilians without any protection under international law.'

From effectively shutting down a neighboring government and its financial sector in response to moving a World War II era statue, to disrupting communication platforms in Eastern Europe in concert with kinetic operations, to gaining access to American critical infrastructure, Russia is actively pursuing its strategic objectives through cyber proxies. To date, the United States has tried a variety of methods to hold Russia accountable for its cyber activities including: indicting Russian intelligence officers; sanctioning the assets of individual Russian officials; and implementing broader economic sanctions. However, the United States implemented these actions months—if not years—after the incidents first became known and, therefore, had little utility in dissuading future Russian aggression.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Delays in the U.S. response to cyber activities reduce their effectiveness.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Much of the United States’ delay and ambiguity in response seems, at least in part, due to a burdensome attribution process that imposes unrealistic legal standards to effectively react to cyber activities. The speed with which cyber incidents occur, the obfuscation of actors, and plausible deniability through cyber proxies make current legal regimes untenable. As stated in the National Defense Strategy of 2018, adversaries are “using other areas of competition short of open warfare to achieve their ends (e.g., information warfare, ambiguous or denied proxy operations, and subversion). These trends, if unaddressed, will challenge our ability to deter aggression.” This assessment is especially relevant to Russia as one of the most sophisticated cyber actors known to use cyber proxies to challenge the United States.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - A new U.S. policy of rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy is needed.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States should move away from the current international legal standards of proxy attribution to confront Russia and its use of cyber proxies. Instead, a new policy—one grounded in a strategy of rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy—should be used to supplement the current void of applicable international law. The National Cyber Strategy of 2018 identified the United States’ need to build a cyber-deterrence initiative, but failed to give concrete policy prescriptions for dealing with cyber aggression. New standards of rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy would complement international law and induce Russia to adhere to acceptable norms of behavior in cyberspace.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The article's objective is to propose strategies to counter Russian cyber proxies.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This article aims to identify strategy proscriptions to counter Russian cyber proxy activities by assessing Russia’s strategic outlook and use of cyber proxies, identifying various shortcomings of international law, and proscribing a rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy strategy. This strategy will include specific recommendations for rapid attribution and decisively engaging Russia through coercive diplomacy, particularly economic sanctions on the Russian oil and gas sector. Such attribution and sanctions will deter Russia from future cyber activities against the interests of the United States and begin to rein in the proxy actors working under Russia.'</blockquote>"

The relationship is premised on the mutual benefit of both parties that exceed the costs of conducting business; however, the principal (i.e., the state) is the chief beneficiary and directs the agent. Additionally, the relationship between the agent and the principal must be intentional for the principal to be held responsible for the actions of the agent. Therefore, an actor who operates on behalf of a principal, for the principal’s benefit, with some formalized relationship, will impute its actions to the principal and is considered a proxy.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Proxies provide \"war on the cheap\" and distance from direct conflict.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Proxy relationships can be particularly attractive to states because they provide “war on the cheap.” States generally use proxies to accomplish a specific task that allows the state to utilize and benefit from a resource without having to maintain the overhead costs associated with continual employment. As more actors enter the realm of cyberspace and gain technical sophistication, competition between proxies will increase and theoretically drive costs down even further.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Using proxies also puts distance between an aggressor state and target state. Proxies provide states an outlet to pursue foreign policy objectives at a lower cost and with a reduced threat of escalation. As in the Cold War, direct confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union created too great a risk of escalation, but competition via proxies occurred without escalating to direct conflict between the superpowers (e.g., the Russian–Afghan War, or American intervention in Vietnam). A principal state can use proxies to escalate or deescalate engagements with the presumption of effective control of the proxy.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Proxies offer plausible deniability.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Finally, proxies provide states with some level of plausible deniability for its actions in cyberspace. Plausible deniability benefits states in “situations in which a target state is able to attribute an attack to an actor, but unable to prove a link between such an actor and a state sponsor.” However, as states become more sophisticated and confident in their attribution processes, the cover and appeal of plausible deniability diminishes.'</blockquote>"

The cases below demonstrate an active attempt to undermine the political stability of the United States, target critical infrastructure, and wreak havoc globally.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Russian state agencies collaborate with cyber proxies to achieve strategic objectives.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As demonstrated in Table 1, over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States. As stated in the United States Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, “revisionist powers . . . are competing across all dimensions of power. They have increased efforts short of armed conflict by expanding coercion to new fronts, violating principles of sovereignty [and] exploiting ambiguity.” Cyber proxies have become a valuable resource for the Russian government because they can accomplish political objectives economically while providing Russia plausible deniability from attribution. Finally, Russia recognizes its relative economic, political, and military shortcomings compared to the United States and utilizes cyber proxies to asymmetrically offset its weaknesses and challenge the United States.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Russian cyber activities are informed by historical context and current strategic needs.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Russia’s current approach to the cyber realm is informed by past events, especially its defeat in the Cold War. At the end of the Cold War, and in the decades since, Russia has recognized its inability to compete with the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies economically, militarily, and even ideologically in international politics. The sway and intrigue of international communism and Marxism was largely lost with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, many in Russia did not believe the end of the Cold War was evidence of liberal democracy triumphing over Marxism, rather they perceived the West had effectively subverted the Soviets through various sources of national power and messaging.'</blockquote>"

However, many in Russia did not believe the end of the Cold War was evidence of liberal democracy triumphing over Marxism, rather they perceived the West had effectively subverted the Soviets through various sources of national power and messaging.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Russia seeks asymmetric means to counter perceived threats from the West.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This belief led Russia to find asymmetric means to counter a perceived and ever growing threat of domination from the United States and Europe. In the immediate aftermath of the Cold War “Russia initially sought to integrate into the Western system in the early 1990s,” however, Russia’s outlook has since changed to “view the U.S.-led [international] order as a threat to Russia’s core interests in its perceived sphere of influence.” Recognizing its relative position, Russia has sought to find asymmetric means to counter an ever growing threat of domination from the United States and Europe. To counteract their disadvantages at the end of the Cold War, and to build national power before reentering international power politics, Russia first needed to influence and control its domestic populace.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Russia uses political warfare to maintain ideological control.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Like many authoritarian regimes, Russia sees itself in a constant state of competition and attack. Russia perceives its foes, led by the United States, as constantly competing for the hearts and minds of the Russian citizenry and testing Russia’s domestic ideological hegemony. Accordingly, Russia has taken aggressive steps to counter any assumed usurpation by sponsoring state news agencies, intimidating sources critical of the Kremlin, and launching effective and widespread media campaigns that reflect the government’s interests. The Russian government has projected the perception of a constant ideological struggle with foreign states on its populace in a controlled manner to ensure support for its political objectives. By proliferating the idea of an ideological siege, the Kremlin has attempted to embolden citizens to assist the state or to placidly accept Russia’s political messaging.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Russia's political warfare includes extensive information operations.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Russia has adopted a whole of government approach, known as “political warfare,” to counter the perceived threat from the United States. Political warfare refers to “the employment of military, intelligence, diplomatic, financial, and other means—short of conventional war—to achieve national objectives.” In reality, political warfare is similar to the multi-domain campaign of the United States in that it harnesses the powers of diplomacy, information, military, and economics (or DIME), to achieve strategic objectives across the spectrum of conflict. As a component of political warfare, Russia uses “information warfare” to achieve its international political objectives. As part of its larger political warfare strategy, the Russian perspective on information warfare encompasses exploiting computer networks and associated platforms, as well as “electronic warfare, psychological operations, and information operations.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Russia prioritizes information warfare to achieve political goals.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Recognizing its power projection shortcomings, the 2010 Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation emphasized “the prior implementation of measures of information warfare in order to achieve political objectives without the utilization of military force and, subsequently, in the interest of shaping a favorable response from the world community to the utilization of military force.” For Russia, “the main battlespace is the mind and, as a result, new-generation wars are to be dominated by information and psychological warfare, in order to achieve superiority in troops and weapons control, morally and psychologically depressing the enemy’s armed forces personnel and civil population.” It is through a “siege” lens that Russia views the rest of the world and justifies the use of information warfare to influence and undermine its perceived adversaries. Arguably, Russia believes pursuing information warfare mirrors the actions of its adversaries and is, therefore, an appropriate response to those perceived threats.'</blockquote>"

The role of non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.” As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Russia integrates cyberspace and information operations to achieve strategic effects.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Under current doctrine, the United States “treats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . .

Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter states, “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Traditional concepts of force guide current definitions of force under international law.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The term “force” in Article 2(4) has generally meant “armed force” directed against the territorial integrity of a state by an armed aggressor. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (Definition of Aggression) provided examples of force between states, including “invasion or attack by armed forces . . . bombardment . . . [or] blockade of ports . . . .” While the list is not exhaustive, traditional concepts of force are still the guiding principles when determining if a force-threshold meets international legal standards. Under current definitions, Russia’s actions do not meet the international legal threshold for a use of force.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - U.S. \"effects-based\" test for cyber-activity and its implications.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States uses an “effects-based” test to determine whether a cyber-activity rises to the level of force, meaning a cyber-activity is compared to traditional kinetic operations. Under the United States’ view, a cyber-activity must “proximately result in death, injury, or significant destruction [to] be viewed as a use of force.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Tallinn Manual 2.0's alignment with U.S. approach.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Tallinn Manual 2.0 echoes the United States approach in Rule 69, stating that “[a] cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.” Therefore, because Russian cyber-activities have not crossed the kinetic effects threshold, or met the United Nation’s international standard for a use of force, Russia’s actions cannot be considered a use of force by the United States.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Implications of actions below the threshold of force for U.S. self-defense.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Designating Russian actions below the threshold of force is significant because it limits the United States’ ability to invoke measures in self-defense to counter Russian aggression.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Russian cyber actions are considered espionage rather than internationally wrongful acts.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Article 2 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) states, “[t]here is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission: a) is attributable to the State under international law; and b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.” Further, “[t]he characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law” not the domestic law of a state. However, international law has specifically left the issue of espionage unaddressed, thus creating a void in applicable international law.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - Definition of cyber espionage and its acceptance in state behavior.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Tallinn Manual 2.0 defines cyber espionage as “any act undertaken clandestinely or under false pretenses that uses cyber capabilities to gather, or attempt to gather, information.” The idea of peacetime espionage has almost become opinio juris as an acceptable norm of state behavior because it is so pervasive and accepted.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - U.S. responses to cyber intrusions support non-regulation of espionage by international law.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States’ previous responses to cyber intrusions support the notion that cyber activities are not “internationally wrongful acts, but instead [are] a species of espionage that is generally unregulated by international law.” While Russia’s cyber actions against the United States may appear egregious, they fall within the scope of espionage and are outside the purview of international wrongful acts.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 9 - Attribution of cyber proxy activities to a state faces several challenges.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Attributing cyber proxy activities to a state presents a trifecta of problems. First, to attribute a cyber-action to a state through proxy action, it must be determined what level of control the state has over the proxy or non-state actor. Second, if the responsible state does exert the requisite control, it is unclear how certain (i.e., what standard of proof) a victim-state must be before taking counter-actions against the responsible state. Third, applicable attribution models are based on cases dealing with clear uses of force, while cyber-activities rarely meet the use of force threshold. Combining these three factors outlines the limited utility international law provides when attempting to attribute cyber proxy activity to a state.'</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - U.S. needs a rapid attribution strategy to counter Russian cyber activities.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The National Cyber Strategy states, “[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .” To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential. As Harold Koh, former legal advisor for the Department of State, aptly stated, questions of attribution “are as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - New attribution policy should be grounded in foreign policy and power politics.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A new attribution policy should be grounded in foreign policy and power politics by 1) examining the cyber activity for common or key indicators attributable to a known state or proxy actor; and 2) determining which state stands to gain geopolitically from a specific activity against the interests of the United States. Once the United States has made its assessment, the responsible state should be identified and attributed through a public announcement. Under this attribution regime, the United States will have the flexibility to exercise different levers of national power to counter cyber aggressors long before attempting to meet a high international legal standard of proof. As another former legal advisor to the Department of State, Brian Egan noted, “a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber-operation to another State. . . . [T]here is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action.”'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'When making an attribution claim for malicious cyber activity, the United States should act in its security interests, make a reasoned decision, and promptly confront cyber aggressors with the best information available. In other words, the United States should not allow imperfect information to delay and compromise public attribution and an appropriate response.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Burden-shifting model for attribution and consequences of non-cooperation.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'After the United States has publicly attributed a cyber activity to a state, the burden should shift to the accused state to rebut the allegation. The accused state would have two options: 1) demonstrate it has not sanctioned the activity and is therefore not responsible; or, 2) actively work with the United States to hold the perpetrators accountable before retaliation measures are enacted. If the accused state simply denies the suspected malicious activity without providing any additional evidence, or is non-cooperative, then coercive diplomatic actions should be considered and initiated against that state.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It may be argued that a policy with a lower attribution standard and corresponding coercive measures is destabilizing; however, the opposite is true. “The proof necessary for attribution in cyber exploitation involving State responsibility certainly need not stand up in court,” and remains a state’s prerogative. The United States has taken a cautious approach to publicly attributing cyber activity, which has, in turn, emboldened aggressors. Publicly announcing attribution means “attackers are no longer invisible and there will be consequences for their actions. This message reshapes opponent thinking about the risk and potential costs of cyber actions against the United States.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Rapid attribution can establish cyber norms and deter aggressors.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States operating with greater attribution freedom to address malicious cyber activity directly could have a stabilizing effect by establishing cyber norms. As the United States more rapidly attributes cyber proxy activity to states, and standardizes the processes and responses to malicious cyber activity, expectation management and cost analysis on the part of adversaries will determine whether challenging the United States is still beneficial. As of yet, the United States’ responses have not effectively deterred actions by malicious cyber actors. The implementation of stringent economic consequences by the United States may provide more incentive for Russia to exercise its “sanctioning regime” and reign in cyber proxies acting on its behalf.'</blockquote>"

Currently, the United States has a robust economic sanctions regime imposed on Russia, primarily in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine (and also used to address Russia’s other nefarious behaviors). However, there is some debate as to the effectiveness of these sanctions against Russia.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Most sanctions do not broadly target the Russian economy but are specific and narrow.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Most sanctions on Russia do not broadly target the Russian economy or entire sectors. Rather, they consist of broad restrictions against specific individuals and entities, as well as narrower restrictions against wider groups of Russian companies. Overall, more than four-fifths of the largest 100 firms in Russia (in 2018) are not directly subject to any U.S. or [European Union] sanctions, including companies in a variety of sectors, such as transportation, retail, services, mining, and manufacturing.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Targeted and broadly enforced sanctions can have tangible consequences.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Some suggest the sanctions on Russia were purposely designed to be relatively weak so as not to harm the Russian populace at large but to instead focus on members of specific companies, industries, and members of government. However, further analysis shows that when sanctions are targeted against a specific industry and broadly enforced, the sanctions have tangible consequences. It is exactly these types of industry-specific and broadly-enforced sanctions that could, in reaction to malicious cyber activity, be implemented to quickly deter Russia and force the Kremlin to rein in its proxies.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The Russian economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The Russian economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports, making up roughly 60 percent of Russia’s exports and 30 percent of its gross domestic product. Russia is the largest single energy supplier to the Europe Union, accounting for 27 percent of oil imports and 41 percent of natural gas imports. However, the United States and Europe remain strong allies against Moscow.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Total and secondary sanctions could severely impact Russia's economy.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States can impose upon its target the near-equivalent of a siege if it makes economic sanctions total and secondary, meaning applied as well to third parties who traffic with the target. That is because the United States, given its unique economic position, is capable of dividing the world into those who choose to trade with America and those who choose to trade with the target.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - U.S. and European allies should target Russian oil and gas exports to stop cyber activities.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The United States should work with its European allies to implement sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports to stop malicious cyber activities. While the specific methods of enacting sanctions are beyond the scope of this article, the United States should specifically seek out methods to exploit Russia’s vulnerable single-commodity-based economy in reaction to malicious cyber activity. Sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas sectors would be particularly effective because those sectors have enormous influence in the Russian government. As discussed, with the proper economic pressures in place—and given the right incentives—the Russian government’s cyber proxy “sanctioning regime” could exercise its ability to identify perpetrators and stop their activity.'</blockquote>"

Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, “[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.”'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Rapid attribution and burden-shifting can counter cyber aggression.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Publicly attributing malicious cyber activity to a state in a timely manner and holding that state responsible through a burden-shifting model is likely to cause some backlash against the United States. However, actions taken in cyberspace that do not neatly fit into a recognized area of international law are bound to create ambiguity and unease. As states continue to develop norms in cyberspace, the United States should harken back to the proverb by Thucydides: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.” The United States should not be constrained by inapplicable and unresponsive international legal regimes. Rather, the United States should confront cyber adversaries through a policy of rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy to deter future aggression, thereby building international law and norms that support the interests of the United States.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'MAJ Anderson is the brigade judge advocate for the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade at Fort Gordon, Georgia.'</blockquote>"

The environment of cyberspace proposes vulnerabilities to a state’s national security because of the connections that exist in all facets of the infrastructure. For example, in modern society, the dependence of Internet connectivity is illustrated through the interconnectivity of financial institutions, transportation, power, and other important infrastructures. Since cyberspace is interconnected, there will always be a risk of affecting other states and its citizens because of any action or response to cyber acts.' (Hill, 2019, p. 13)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Cyberspace and the limitations of existing legal frameworks</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'As explored in detail above, the LOAC and other policies, such as the DoD Law of War Manual operate in cyberspace under the same principles as traditional, kinetic warfare. The argument is that these same concepts can apply to any domain; however, the new form of warfare in cyberspace does not necessarily fit the traditional kinetic principles of LOAC. For example, a cyber act that shuts down a power grid without causing any physical damage to the structure would not necessarily meet the threshold of a cyberattack; however, a bomb that accomplished the same thing would meet that threshold and provide that state with the ability to defend its self under LOAC. An armed attack typically requires a higher threshold to legitimize the use of force in self-defense under LOAC.'

These effects, not unlike traditional kinetic effects, can have significant consequences to the sovereignty of a state; however, under LOAC, they fail to meet the threshold of use of force or armed attack. “The physical damage or harm requirement is only appropriate in a kinetic context, where it is easier to discern when there are kinetic weapons involved.” With the problem of attribution in cyberspace, “physical harm or damage presents a more attenuated, proximate cause rather than a direct cause.” Then in the context of LOAC, states may not suffer traditional kinetic acts through the principle of distinction but are subject to cyber acts that affect civilians without any protection under international law.'

(Hill, 2019, p. 14)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 3,4 - States’ doctrine for cyber operations amid legal ambiguity</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'States have developed doctrine for cyber operations as a way to guide their armed services despite the lack of clarity in international law. Guidance, such as the DOD Law of War Manual details definitions of cyber acts in an effort to formulate an appropriate response. However, internal policies and doctrine are not necessarily helpful in the international community for establishing thresholds for acts that justify the use of force or an armed attack under the United Nations articles 2(4) and 51, respectively. The state must then convince the international community that an act has reached the threshold of a cyberattack or justify a use of force response if the state wants to comply with United Nations charters because of the deficiency in international law regarding cyber operations.' (Hill, 2019, p. 14-15)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'While an assessment of scale and effects is essential in determining appropriate response, equally important is understanding the applicable view of determining whether an armed attack has occurred. Unfortunately, even the experts on the council charged with writing the still recent scholarship of the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on a standard for the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace. They also could not agree on what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state. There is not a definitive law in place regarding the threshold of an armed attack. International scholars in the production of the Tallinn Manual have not been able to define the criteria of an armed attack, and the international community has not been able to classify any cyber acts as meeting that threshold. “No international cyber incidents have, as of 2012, been unambiguously and publicly characterized by the international community as reaching the threshold of an armed attack.” The assessment of scale and effects is essential, but also equally important is the agreement of the international community in the determination of an armed attack. Further, even the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace or what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state.' (Hill, 2019, p. 15)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5,6 - Complexity in attributing responsibility to non-state actors</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Attributing responsibility to non-state actors adds to the complexity of the process of attribution and holding certain entities responsible for hostile cyber acts. The lack of distinction in legal terms, as described above coupled with the lack of definitive evidence to attribute cyber acts to a state creates a level of difficulty that warrants legal requirements. As described in detail above, international law provides governing rules for cyberattacks that meet the threshold of an armed attack and are facilitated by a state. There is not a rule of law or legal guidance on a victim state’s rights when a group or an individual not affiliated with another state commits a hostile cyber act unless that group or individual can be linked to a perpetrating state. Despite the ability of non-state actors to perpetrate hostile cyber acts and their potential to cause political discord, as well as serious legal and political consequences, there are not any provisions within international law to regulate these actions.' (Hill, 2019, p. 15-16)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Moreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and non-state actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of “acting under the direction or control of a state.” An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law. This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state “must exercise effective control over the non-state actor” to be attributable to a state. “Effective control” has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control. However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state’s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.' (Hill, 2019, p. 16)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 7,8 - Challenges in legal representation and consensus on cyber acts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'As presented, key challenges face the international community in the legal representation of cyber acts under international law. One of the main challenges in this area is that there has been difficulty in reaching a consensus across the international community on how to apply traditional laws of armed conflict to cyber acts. Application has led to a lack of expressed guidance in handling hostile cyber acts perpetrated by both state and non-state actors and left important questions as to how to proceed with a proportionate, distinct response. Since LOAC does not provide a sufficient definition of an “armed attack” as it relates to acts committed in cyberspace, victim states are forced to rely on their assessment of the act to articulate any response they may consider. The thresholds that exist for the attribution of states and non-state actors are very hard to reach. The more non-state actors exploit cyber vulnerabilities of victim states, the more perpetrating states may choose to support non-state actors covertly, resulting in victim states developing liberal cases for meeting those thresholds. The burden of proof is on the victim state in these cases, and the victim states need evidence on which to base their assessment.' (Hill, 2019, p. 16-17)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 9,10 - State sovereignty and international law on cyber acts</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'State Sovereignty. A deficiency exists in international law regarding the definitive understanding of whether cyber acts constitute the use of force or an armed attack. However, “there is no question that non-destructive or injurious malicious cyber operations can violate various established international law norms.” One example of international law norms that can be affected by malicious cyber acts is the principle of sovereignty, which “empowers a state to exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its territory.” The Tallinn Manual agreed that a cyber act causing destruction to a victim state’s cyber infrastructure violated the victim state’s principle of sovereignty; however, the Tallinn Manual did not agree whether a cyber act, such as delivering malware used to disrupt or destroy data in a victim state’s cyber infrastructure, should be considered a violation of the victim state’s sovereignty.' (Hill, 2019, p. 17)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'As explored above, there are particular thresholds required for cyber acts to be attributable to states for both state actions and actions committed by non-state actors. The thresholds of effective control and overall control set a precedent under international law that requires victim states to assess various factors to attribute an act effectively to a perpetrating state. Though cyber acts can propose a significant threat to a victim state’s sovereignty, the high threshold for attribution of the perpetrating state’s responsibility, as well as the high threshold for the act to reach the level of an armed attack or warrant the use of force under international law incentivizes states to use cyberspace to further their political objectives through the use of anonymous acts and non-state actors. This situation is one of the reasons victim states should include additional factors in their assessment of cyber acts for attribution.' (Hill, 2019, p. 17)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 11,12 - Technological limitations in cyber attribution</\r\n\r\nh3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Limited Technology. Another consideration under attribution is the limitations associated with technology and its use to provide information related to the responsibility of cyber acts. Technical attribution is limited by the structure of the Internet. Information traveling through the Internet is typically organized in “packets.” These packets are “discrete units of data outfitted with delivery instructions such as destination addresses,” including source Internet protocol (IP) addresses. Routers convey these packets to a particular location; however, routers do not confirm that a source address or IP is “genuine.” Though the IPs are included in the router’s packet of information, these addresses are not always helpful in discerning or verifying the source of the packet of information. Because of these structural features of the Internet, those perpetrating cyber acts against other cyber infrastructures can conceal the originating source of a packet of information.' (Hill, 2019, p. 17-18)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'The use of technological and forensic tools may allow cyber professionals to implicate perpetrators in cyber incidents; however, there may be circumstances in which technical attribution is insufficient given the ease by which perpetrators may mask their identity, evading responsibility for the act. Circumstances may be such that even though technological means determine a particular actor involved, there may be further evidence to consider that may lead to responsibility attributed to a state rather than an individual actor or group. To further complicate this issue, a state may not want to expose the actor if that effort would undermine the state’s efforts politically or expose any use of tradecraft. The social and political aspects can be crucial to a state’s decision-making in terms of attribution and response.' (Hill, 2019, p. 18)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Another consideration under attribution is the limitations associated with technology and its use to provide information related to the responsibility of cyber acts. Technical attribution is limited by the structure of the Internet. Information traveling through the Internet is typically organized in “packets.” These packets are “discrete units of data outfitted with delivery instructions such as destination addresses,” including source Internet protocol (IP) addresses. Routers convey these packets to a particular location; however, routers do not confirm that a source address or IP is “genuine.” Though the IPs are included in the router’s packet of information, these addresses are not always helpful in discerning or verifying the source of the packet of information. Because of these structural features of the Internet, those perpetrating cyber acts against other cyber infrastructures can conceal the originating source of a packet of information.' (Hill, 2019, p. 17)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Challenges in technical attribution and the role of human factors</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'The use of technological and forensic tools may allow cyber professionals to implicate perpetrators in cyber incidents; however, there may be circumstances in which technical attribution is insufficient given the ease by which perpetrators may mask their identity, evading responsibility for the act. Circumstances may be such that even though technological means determine a particular actor involved, there may be further evidence to consider that may lead to responsibility attributed to a state rather than an individual actor or group. To further complicate this issue, a state may not want to expose the actor if that effort would undermine the state’s efforts politically or expose any use of tradecraft. The social and political aspects can be crucial to a state’s decision-making in terms of attribution and response.' (Hill, 2019, p. 18)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Since cyberspace is vast, interconnected, and includes various systems and equipment to process information, hostile or malicious cyber acts can be conducted through many different means. For example, there are Internet-based acts and non-Internet-based acts that require different technical means of attribution. Trying to determine responsibility in Internet-based acts may require three levels of attribution. The levels consist of finding the equipment used in the act, figuring out the owner of the equipment used in the act, and locating the individual or group responsible for the act. Attributing an act cannot rely only on the technical means of finding the equipment used in an act but must also assess who is responsible for the act. The technical aspects of attribution are important to answer first level questions and possibly second level questions in identifying perpetrators, but the third level of attribution may not be solved solely by technological means.' (Hill, 2019, p. 18)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - Different types of cyber acts and their implications for attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Additionally, there are different types of acts that can cause different types of attribution problems, as illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1 includes these types of threats: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cybercrime, and cyber nuisance. A cyber act can involve several stages that may include gaining control over another computer, network, or system, attacking one computer with another, spoofing IP addresses to disguise the originating machine as another, or harnessing multiple different computers as in the case of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The type of cyber act should be determined, technical tools should be applied to start the process of attribution, and then an analysis of the type of threat should be implemented. Insight into the type of threat can provide information on other techniques that are needed to conclude responsibility for an act.' (Hill, 2019, p. 19)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'In an interview with Maj Zachary Smith—deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Division—he indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace. The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare. Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda. A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain. Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states. Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace. Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law. Most cyber incidents can fit into one of these threat categories, but attribution is the most significant in the case of warfare because of the implications under international law and a victim state’s ability to appropriately respond.' (Hill, 2019, p. 19-20)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Importance of understanding the type of cyber act for effective attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Determination of the act is vital because assessing the act establishes the need for attribution. In most cases of cyber incidents, the incidents are not significant enough to reach the level of warfare, and less significant incidents can be categorized as a lower threat. These threat categories allow for more effective threat management against future cyber acts.' (Hill, 2019, p. 20)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'“Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyberattack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and attacker.” As discussed above, once an act has occurred, the nature of the act should be considered as a step in the attribution process. For example, a state should assess what kind of cyber operation has occurred, what the potential effects of the act were, what definition does the act meet, and what was the motive behind the act. Each threat can create additional problems in attributing an act to an actor, but assessing the threat can provide leads to identifying the perpetrator. In the case of attribution in cyberspace, the analysis of signatures used through technical and forensic means, as well as behavioral factors in actors, such as an actor’s preference for Internet platforms or particular types of spoofing can aid the limiting factors of the technological process for attributing cyber acts.'

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The attribution process must consider various types of cyber acts and actors to determine appropriate responses.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is “necessary to consider the issue of the ‘originator’ in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack” and “indisputable that the actions of non-state actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.”' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - International law does not explicitly address cyber acts but considers various factors to determine an armed attack.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Though international law does not explicitly address cyber acts, the Tallinn Manual states there are factors that victim states can depend on in the determination of an armed attack. It involves finding more information than just the location of the source of the act. Among these factors noted, the Tallinn Manual states considering property ownership, status of individuals targeted, and the motivation for the specific target should determine whether the act meets the threshold of an armed attack. This determination indicates that there is a need to look beyond the physical implications of an act and that there is value in assessing other factors in attributing a cyber act.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Additional factors and considerations are crucial for victim states to determine state or non-state actor involvement.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Moreover, these additional factors and considerations can assist victim states in determining whether or not a cyber act is committed by a non-state actor under the control of a perpetrating state. This analysis is crucial in the establishment of an armed attack or an international armed conflict executed through an organized armed group of non-state actors. Without the inclusion of these factors and considerations, a victim state is limited in its ability to respond to a violation of its sovereignty. Since the thresholds under international law are high, not definitively set forth, and technology is limited in its assessment of the originator of an act, non-technical collection of human factors should be considered relevant circumstantial evidence in proving a victim state’s case in an international forum, for attributing the cyber act or acts to a perpetrating state.' (Hill, 2019)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Understanding international law is necessary but insufficient for attribution; human factors also play a critical role.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Factors. Though an understanding of international law and the principles of the law of war are necessary for the context of cyber operations, the law is only part of the attribution equation. In law enforcement, technology and forensics aid law enforcement officials in their pursuit of attribution. However, other human factors that provide critical information in developing the identity of a perpetrator. Similar to law enforcement, human factors are vital in determining attribution in cyber operations against victim states. For instance, deciphering motives behind an incident could provide victim states with valuable information on the responsible party. If attribution were to rely solely on technological means, victim states may uncover an actor, but miss a more significant player involved, such as a state potentially sponsoring the malicious cyber acts to further its political agenda.'

The process of attributing a cyber act to a state or non-state actor is a “nuanced and multi-layered process.” Therefore, attribution cannot be considered merely a technical problem. It is a social problem in a technically fluid environment meaning that technology alone is not sufficient to attribute a cyber act to a state or non-state actor to the level required under international law. Accordingly, a multi-dimensional approach that incorporates multiple factors typically used in law enforcement to gather evidence of the nature of the offender is needed to effectively attribute hostile, malicious cyber acts to the appropriate and responsible party.' (Hill, 2019, p. 22)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Additional considerations include the risk and speed of attribution.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Additional Considerations. Though human factors are an essential part of the attribution process, other variables are also important in considering a multi-dimensional approach. Other considerations in addition to the type of cyber activity and actors involved are the risk associated with the act and the speed in which attribution can be accomplished. According to Dr. Richard Harknett, head of the political science department at the University of Cincinnati, the lack of certainty in attributing responsibility to a particular actor exacerbates the need to act. The uncertainty inherent in the attribution process affects decision-making speed. It is essential to consider the degree of certainty in attributing responsibility as a variable in the assessment because this is not addressed in absolute terms under international law and remains a question of what would be considered acceptable to legitimize a response to a cyber act.' (Hill, 2019, p. 22-23)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Timing of attribution affects state confidence and response strategy.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Further complicating this issue is the factor of timing. What amount of timing would be necessary to elevate a state’s confidence in its attribution assessment from low to high? What consequences would timing have? In terms of shaping an adversary’s behavior, the timing of response could have negative consequences.' (Hill, 2019, p. 23)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - The need for a multi-dimensional approach in the attribution process.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process.

The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court. As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible. The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.'

There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation. The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation. The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state. With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals. The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for “clear evidence” in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of “clear evidence.” Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” nor does it require absolute certainty. Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.' (Hill, 2019, p. 23-24)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It is well established that in its very general sense, “attribution is a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, geopolitics, among other” things. Such human factors assist in the attribution of individuals and groups to a particular state. Circumstantial evidence such as background and associations provide victim states with information that can link an individual or groups to a particular state. These types of factors provide a picture of the party responsible and the likelihood the party is associated with others. In the law enforcement field, an investigator’s study of a perpetrator’s past affiliations and associations can provide significant leads that can help identify the responsible party behind a particular criminal act. Similarly, attribution can also include the determination if an act was meant to be malicious or hostile in the first place. Additional factors provide an opportunity for states to generate an accurate threat picture that can guide them in the collection of evidence in their case for attribution.'

He further opined that “<strong>the proliferation of cyber capabilities coupled with new warfighting technologies will increase the incidence of standoff and remote operations, especially in the initial stages of conflict.</strong>”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - [States view cyberspace as a crucial operational domain]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As policymakers warn of the dangers of cyber conflicts and exalt the virtues of cyber peace, most states consider cyberspace the fifth operational domain, with equal, or perhaps greater future importance to the traditional domains of land, sea, air, and space. <strong>State military and intelligence agencies continue to conduct cyber espionage and covert attacks on computer systems and networks in pursuit of strategic political or military objectives, both before and during conflicts.</strong> Yet, there is limited transparency on how states consider using their cyber capabilities, as only a few countries have publicly announced their cyber doctrines and underlying strategies.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - [Widespread development of cyber commands by many countries]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'For example, McAfee, the global computer security software company, estimated in 2007 that over 120 countries were working on cyber commands, whereas Dévai listed 114 countries that, as of 2013, were developing civilian and military cyber capabilities, policies, doctrines and organizations at varying levels of maturity or focus. <strong>Considering that many of the officially declared ‘defensive’ cyber capabilities could easily be deployed in offensive cyber operations</strong>, as well as the fact that data assembled by cyber experts is often based on publicly available information only, it is not surprising that such estimations vary, and that the true state of cyber warfare preparedness and capabilities worldwide is difficult to ascertain.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - [High degree of cyber insecurity due to various factors]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This high degree of uncertainty, when coupled with the low cost and easy acquisition of cyber weapons, ample and growing target selection, and multiplicity of types of attacks that may go unnoticed for a long time, contributes to a prevailing state of cyber insecurity in the international community. <strong>The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that there is no commonly accepted terminology of critical cyber terms</strong> (e.g., ‘cyber’ vs. ‘information’ security) among key cyber actors, which affects the ability of most likely strategic adversaries to establish common ground as a prerequisite for dialogue.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - [Broad definition and objectives of cyber warfare]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Cyber warfare is a broad term that refers to actions by nation-state actors (or other international organizations with mala fide intentions) to use hacking tools to achieve military objectives in another country. The tools for hacking are varied and can include malicious software, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, fake news, and malicious insiders as well as tools for camouflaging identify of hackers or misdirecting attribution. The objectives could be tactical or strategic. The tactical objectives could be degrading the capability of an adversary both in the battlefield or in weapons development (e.g., Stuxnet) or espionage to collect intelligence. The strategic objectives could be the use of soft power such as propaganda to influence public opinion for regime change or altering the political outcomes of the election or hard power by leaving dormant malicious software in critical infrastructure to leverage during times of conflict.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - [Blurring lines between conventional and cyber war]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The boundary between conventional and cyber war is blurring as conventional defensive and offensive capabilities increasingly use the Internet for command, control, communications, and intelligence</strong>, making information and communication infrastructures and networks both the targets and vehicles of military attacks. At the same time, the Internet has become the communications backbone required for the functioning of modern societies and economic systems. Therefore, the nature and means of the military defense of these systems also have to change and become more flexible to adapt to these emerging threats. Above all, the nascent cyber defense mechanism of any state must be able to provide the national political leadership with answers regarding a number of critical questions: What is the origin of a cyberattack; where did it come from? Who is responsible? What is the recommended course of action, or response?'</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - [Attribution is crucial for justifying retaliation]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution of cyberattacks is very important, especially to justify retaliatory actions against the perpetrators and prevent accidental retaliation against innocent targets. The entire domain of cyber norms and confidence-building measures is centered on visibility, i.e., being able to identify perpetrators of attacks and being able to ascertain adversarial strength. <strong>In the absence of such verification, the suspicion remains, and nation states assume the worst and prepare themselves by building stronger and stronger arsenals to maintain strategic equilibrium.</strong>' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:90)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - [Anonymity on the Internet shields criminals and terrorists]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Anonymity is often regarded as a key foundational principle of the Internet, driven by the need to shield the identity of the user and dissociate users’ actions from their identity. Such anonymity ensures the ability to speak freely without fear of retribution, which can be beneficial in political commentaries, debating contentious issues, asking personal questions, researching competitors, and purchasing goods or services without revealing personal choices. Privacy advocates have gone to great lengths to protect the anonymity of users by providing services, such as remailers and encryption, that further camouflage users’ identities and protect them from government surveillance. However, while beneficial in some contexts and circumstances, such anonymity also shields the perpetrators of crime and terrorism on the Internet. <strong>The cloak of anonymity protects and enables perpetrators of money laundering, extortion, espionage, and theft.</strong> Similarly, actors engaging in cyber warfare leverage anonymity on the Internet to conduct surveillance, probes, and attacks without drawing attention to their actions. There has to be a balance between anonymity and security to ensure people’s right to privacy and security.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:90)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - [Digital forensics can help identify cyberattackers]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Despite the inherent anonymity of the Internet, users leave traces of their activities along the way. These traces can provide valuable clues that can reveal the identity of the attackers and their possible motivations. The goal of digital forensics is to collect the traces, connect the dots, and make inferences about the incident, including identifying the perpetrators, determining the mechanism of operation, and cataloging the information compromised or altered. The tools, processes, and knowledge for digital forensics are freely available. Still, the anonymity of the Internet makes such analysis difficult, especially in the case of cyber warfare, where relevant information of the attack is hidden behind country firewalls and protected by the sponsors of the attack.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:90)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - [Digital forensics can link attackers to incidents]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Digital forensics can strip away some of the Internet’s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident. <strong>Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks.</strong>' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:91)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 5,6 - [Multi-dimensional nature of attribution and common cyberattack tools]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing “who to blame” can be more important than “who did it?” A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:91)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The tools and techniques of cyberattacks are common to “cyber warfare,” “cyber terrorism” and “cyber activism.”</strong> Only by analyzing the actors, modes of operation, and motivations behind attacks, and their intended or manifested targets, can one differentiate between the three. In contrast to conventional warfare, it is very difficult to distinguish whether attacks on a website or the online theft of data are attributable to individuals in another state who are motivated by financial gain, political or religious ideology, or actions taken by that state’s intelligence agency or military (or their proxies). Since states may launch cyberattacks via proxies in other states, attribution difficulties are compounded, and present fundamental challenges during both conflict and peace times, when international cooperation and treaty compliance verification take hold.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:91)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - [Challenges in digital forensics for cyber warfare]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Digital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices, putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion.</strong> Several pieces of relevant information can be used for tracing the activities of a person or a device, including IP-addresses, domain names, and time stamps. These individual entries in different log files can be time-correlated to create a chain of evidence and demonstrate activity emanating from a specific source.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:92)</blockquote>"

These tools will only work to the extent that there is a political will for international cooperation in data sharing and analysis. Important first steps would include the establishment of hotlines and the deployment at strategic locations of standard data collection devices that could not be tampered with. These could be foundational to support the forensic analysis of cyberattacks and international determination of instances of cyber warfare. <strong>An international body needs to be created and deployed in a neutral country to monitor and evaluate cyber conflicts</strong>, with observers present from warring nations. This body would be able to quickly request data access from different sources; lengthy procedures can delay and limit the collection of data, which can be ephemeral. This body will also have the technical expertise to analyze large volumes of data and determine attribution, as well as to confidentially handle intelligence without having to reveal its sources.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:93)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - [Need for standard forensics procedures for cross-border attacks]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Digital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques</strong>. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:94)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - [Digital forensics must evolve to handle large volumes of data]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Additionally, digital forensics is constantly lagging behind the torrid pace of technological evolution, both in types of applications and devices, as well as in volumes of data. In the coming years, digital forensics will need to be able to contend with the extremely high volumes of data, as well as the sophisticated camouflaging techniques that are used in cyber warfare to become a credible factor in the attribution of cyber warfare activities. <strong>To be able to stay on course, we need to have an international forensics research institute for researching and updating forensics practices as information infrastructures evolve</strong> (e.g., connected vehicles, human-implantable devices, self-driving cars). We also need to train experts in each country on best practices (tools and techniques) in digital forensics so that they can conduct their investigations.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:94)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - [Attribution may not always be perfect]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'We must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014. A hacker group calling itself the “Guardians of Peace” released confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee data, vast email and password files, internal documents and communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more. <strong>There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the North Korean government was behind the attack</strong>, given the similarity of the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans; the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians conducted the attack. There is no conclusive proof supporting either theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.' (Sanjay Goel, 2020:94-95)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - [Need for international consensus on cyber warfare protocols]</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The demilitarization of cyberspace or a moratorium on the development of cyber weapons is no longer a possibility</strong>. However, nation states must come together to find common ground in cyber warfare starting with confidence-building measures, norms of behavior, and the applicability of international laws to reduce the possibility of a major catastrophic incident. Formal information sharing (both at CERT and diplomatic levels) and establishing hotlines will help de-escalate future cyber incidents. There needs to be consensus building at the United Nations and other established international bodies such as the Office of Security and Cooperation (OSCE) to find ways of building consensus among nation states on preventing cyber conflicts and building confidence.'

It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe.

So the efficacy of attribution depends on its purpose, context, and audience.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Deterrence through public attribution has a poor record but may still improve cyber defenses</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Public attribution of attacks in the cyber domain has long been thought to further deterrence—the exposed attackers will refrain from future attacks.</strong> Deterrence through attribution has a poor record, however. Yet even where a public attribution does not stop cyberattacks by a perpetrator State, it may enable victim States to improve their cyber defenses and thus.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>deter further attacks.</strong> The potential benefits of public attribution might not end with deterrence or improved defenses, either.

Attackers complicate attributions by deliberately obscuring their identities or by staging their cyberattacks to appear as though they were caused by someone else. Even with recent advances, knowing the machines or IP addresses responsible for the hack is often difficult, costly, and time-consuming, and knowing those things does not necessarily lead easily to the responsible State. Technical and on-the-ground intelligence and police work are often necessary to establish reliable attribution. Even extensive efforts do not always produce unequivocal proof.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Apart from identifying the responsible actor, attribution has also failed to coalesce on what proof should suffice for cyberattack attribution, whether attributions should be public, and what consequences should follow from a successful attribution. More fundamentally, the lack of consensus on standards of proof, public attributions, and the legal consequences of attribution have stymied efforts to clarify what international legal rules apply when cyber operations target civilians and their infrastructure below the use of force threshold and outside of armed conflicts.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Impunity of cyber attackers and increased risks of confusion and escalation due to attribution challenges</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As a result, some States use cyber tools to strike with impunity, knowing (or at least strongly suspecting) that their digital attacks will either not prompt a response or lead to a response that is no more than the “naming and shaming” that goes on in the diplomatic world and in the media. Meanwhile, the threats to infrastructure and extraction of data and intellectual property by cyber means continue at great cost to governments and private industry. We now know that increasingly sophisticated forms of offensive hacking are capable of causing more significant harm, even catastrophic damage, such as shutting down financial systems, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and scrambling communications. These continuing threats make knowing and attributing the source of the cyber intrusion especially important so that States and the international community can respond accordingly.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In addition, the inability to identify the source of a cyberattack potentially increases the risks of confusion and escalation. When the United States released an unclassified summary of its Department of Defense Cyber Strategy in September 2018, attention focused on its commitment to “defend forward to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict.” Yet some see “defending forward” as putting the U.S. military on an offensive, rather than defensive, footing. The recent shift in U.S. cyber policy deepens a cyber variant on a classic security dilemma between States: as one State takes steps to defend itself in cyberspace, it inadvertently threatens other States with what appears to be offensive action. In practice, “defending forward” can look like attacking forward to those experiencing an intrusion.'</blockquote>"

The attacks were, of course, conducted in secret with malware that disguised its origins. Despite these new public accusations, the uncertain attribution of the cyberattacks to Russia made it easy for Russia to deny responsibility.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Accusation of Chinese hackers attempting to acquire vaccine research</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>A few days later, the Justice Department accused two Chinese hackers of trying to acquire vaccine research on behalf of China’s intelligence service.</strong> Despite the outrage expressed in some quarters that the Russians and Chinese would use digital tools to hack Western research into coronavirus vaccines, cyber experts cautioned that this form of cyber espionage—even if clearly attributed (it has not been)—is neither authorized nor forbidden by international law.'</blockquote>"

The SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange hacks avoided sophisticated NSA detection capabilities by launching their tools from inside the United States, where NSA does not operate.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1053)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>At the same time, the advances in technical attribution may be matched by advances in the cyber attackers’ capabilities to hide their identities, leading to an unending cat-and-mouse game.</strong> Thus, identifying the persons, organizations, or States that are legally responsible for a cyberattack remains challenging.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1053)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Challenges derive from technical and legal complexities.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The problems derive from technical means of deception and anonymity, but they are also due to the vagaries of the process of fixing responsibility for cyberattacks within the international community and the malleability and open-endedness of the few attribution rules that currently exist in international law.</strong>' (Banks, 2021, p. 1053)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>In the aggregate, understanding the technical and practical components of attribution is essential but not sufficient for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful but below the use of force threshold for cyber intrusions in the future.</strong>' (Banks, 2021, p. 1054)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 8,9 - The need for coherent international norms.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Meanwhile, as cyber intrusions have proliferated in recent years, and despite the absence of a durable legal regime that punishes malevolent cyber intrusions, many States have invested in doing attribution well and, as a result, deterring or at least discouraging States and other cyber intruders.</strong> When attribution is done badly or not at all, States lose credibility and likely effectiveness in dealing with those who would harm the State and its citizens.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1054)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>These risks hold for State-on-State interactions across the spectrum of cyber operations—from espionage to destructive attacks on infrastructure. Yet even persuasive attribution does not make up for the absence of cyber-specific legal norms specifying what constitutes adequate attribution at international law.</strong> Nor have the technical advances in cyber attribution led to emerging cyber law in the area of State responsibility.'

Over the last two decades, governments and scholars labored over the nuances in deciding when a cyberattack might amount to a use of force or armed attack and, thus, whether international humanitarian law applies in the cyber domain. When cyber weapons cause destruction or injury, the kinetic model works reasonably well in the cyber realm. However, because the vast majority of cyberattacks have less than destructive impacts, the law for controlling the vast majority of cyberattacks has foundered in the underdeveloped international law of State responsibility, sovereignty, countermeasures, and retorsion.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1054)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - International law on State responsibility and its limitations</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The law of State responsibility has long been an underdeveloped area of international law, even before layering on the cybersecurity context.</strong> The International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts are not codified, but many of its provisions reflect widely accepted customary international law. The Draft Articles provide helpful and adequate guidance on when States may attribute cyberattacks to another State, including in situations where a State has exercised “effective control” over the cyber actions of a private actor. Unfortunately, the Draft Articles and customary international law are less helpful in prescribing the law of State responsibility that would say when States are required to attribute cyberattacks to another State. Some States have taken tentative steps toward advancing a legal framework for cyber attribution and the attendant State responsibility. For example, the United States has suggested that certain cyber operations, such as the 2015 Sony hack and 2016 election interference, violated “established international norms.” Of course, the U.S. statements are silent on which norms it believes were violated. Nor do the supposed norm violations carry with them any consequences.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1054)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - The need for attribution to establish State responsibility</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>States should care a great deal about cyber attribution precisely because the absence of attribution precludes State responsibility.</strong> In addition, a persuasive case may be made that international law requires that States attribute internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace if they expect to respond in ways that would otherwise violate international law, e.g., by using force or engaging in countermeasures. For a use of force to be lawful, it must respond to an armed attack. If the responsive use of force is not, in fact, defensive, the putative victim State’s use of force would be prohibited by the UN Charter. Similarly, the Draft Articles state: “An injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply” with its legal obligations. At least by implication, attribution of a cyberattack is required before a State may lawfully engage in countermeasures.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1060)</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Paragraph 1 - The lack of agreed-upon rules for cyber attribution enables a Wild West environment</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The Wild West environment for cyber exploitation persists in part because of a lack of agreed-upon and enforceable rules for attributing cyber intrusions to the responsible actor and then punishing the wrongdoing.</strong> Without attribution rules and practices that are transparent and widely shared, there is no incentive for attackers to stop what they are doing. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1058)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - International law on State responsibility provides guidance but lacks specificity</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The customary international law of State responsibility and attribution is largely drawn from the work of over a half-century of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Articles on State Responsibility.</strong> While not binding on any nation, the ILC articles were commended to member States by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 and have been cited repeatedly by courts, tribunals, and other bodies. The unsurprising threshold understanding is that a State is responsible for the actions of its organs, officials, or any persons or groups it directs or controls.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1058)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - The need for developing specific international norms for cyber responsibility</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>What is missing are specific norms for cyber responsibility that would fill in the gaps in the existing international legal framework.</strong> While the ILC articles provide a useful starting point, they do not address the unique challenges posed by cyber intrusions, such as the difficulty in identifying perpetrators and the rapid pace of technological change. Developing these norms is essential for establishing a clear and enforceable legal regime for cyber attributions.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1058)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The importance of transparency and cooperation in cyber attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Transparency and international cooperation are crucial for effective cyber attribution.</strong> States must be willing to share evidence and intelligence, collaborate on investigations, and jointly attribute cyber intrusions. This collective approach can enhance the credibility of attributions and build a stronger international consensus on the rules and norms governing state behavior in cyberspace.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1059)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - The challenges of achieving consensus on cyber norms</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Achieving consensus on cyber norms is challenging due to differing national interests and perspectives on sovereignty and security.</strong> While some states may prioritize strict rules and accountability, others may be more concerned about retaining their freedom to conduct cyber operations. Navigating these differences requires diplomacy, dialogue, and a willingness to compromise on key issues.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1059)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - The potential for existing international law to adapt to cyber threats</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Despite the challenges, there is potential for existing international law to adapt to the realities of cyber threats.</strong> By building on the principles established in the ILC articles and other relevant frameworks, the international community can develop a robust legal regime that addresses the unique characteristics of cyber intrusions while upholding fundamental principles of state responsibility and sovereignty.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1060)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - The role of international organizations in shaping cyber norms</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>International organizations such as the United Nations and regional bodies can play a key role in shaping and promoting cyber norms.</strong> Through forums, agreements, and collaborative initiatives, these organizations can facilitate dialogue, build consensus, and provide a platform for states to commit to common standards and practices in cyber attribution and response.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1060)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - The necessity of a multi-stakeholder approach to cyber governance</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>A multi-stakeholder approach involving governments, the private sector, civil society, and academia is necessary for effective cyber governance.</strong> Each of these groups brings unique perspectives and expertise that can contribute to a comprehensive and balanced framework for cyber responsibility and attribution. Engaging all relevant stakeholders can help ensure that the resulting norms and rules are practical, enforceable, and widely accepted.' (Banks, 2021, p. 1060)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 9 - The ongoing evolution of cyber attribution practices</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Cyber attribution practices are continually evolving as technology advances and new threats emerge.</strong> Staying ahead of these developments requires ongoing investment in research, capacity building, and international cooperation. By remaining adaptable and responsive to changes in the cyber landscape, the international community can better address the challenges of cyber attribution and enhance global security.'

(Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - [Purpose of international commissions of inquiry]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'The agreement also provided for international commissions of inquiry “to facilitate a solution of [‘differences of opinion’] by elucidating the facts by means of an impartial and conscientious investigation.” Fyodor Martens, the prominent Russian diplomat who introduced the commissions of inquiry provisions during the 1899 Peace Conference, <strong>described them as establishing a voluntary fact-finding mechanism that could avoid inflammatory disinformation</strong> about the causes of an international dispute while gaining time to resolve the matter.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - [Russian delegation's proposal and Martens' view]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Interestingly, the Russian delegation to the 1899 Conference proposed adding the investigation of questions of responsibility to the duties of the commissions of inquiry, although Martens himself expressed limited enthusiasm for the proposal, noting that it could trespass into the realm of arbitration. He conceded, however, that States were free to conclude special agreements to that effect.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - [Historical example of a commission of inquiry]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Indeed, in 1904, a commission of inquiry established to investigate a maritime incident in the North Sea was authorized to establish responsibility for the incident and to allocate the degree of blame of those involved.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - [Modern use of fact-finding mechanisms in human rights law]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In recent decades, fact-finding and inquiry mechanisms often have been employed in the field of international human rights law to establish accountability for violations and to facilitate subsequent action by political bodies entrusted with promoting respect for human rights. The frequent utilization of ad hoc bodies, such as commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, <strong>more permanent bodies with renewable mandates, such as thematic and country rapporteurs and working groups,</strong> and international treaty bodies invested with the power to conduct inquiries, reflects the international human rights system’s post-1967 shift from standard-setting to implementation activities.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - [Examples of thematic and country-specific mandates]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'For a list of thematic and country-specific mandates created by the U.N. Human Rights Council, see Country Mandates, UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS, OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - [Advancing accountability through independent experts]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In many cases where fact-finding mechanisms have been established and utilized, the resort to independent experts links, directly or indirectly, to the goal of advancing legal and political accountability. By elucidating facts through a process of investigation that is legitimate and credible, States that violate international law are less able to avoid legal responsibility by denying the underlying facts or their involvement in the situation.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - [Shaming and alerting states and non-state actors]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Furthermore, publicizing facts with self-evident legal or moral implications can “shame” State and non-State actors, as well as alert them and other actors to the possibility of being held accountable should they continue to engage in unlawful conduct. Determining the facts can also provide a degree of satisfaction for victims.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 9 - [Enabling follow-up action for accountability]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'And of course, establishing the factual record can enable follow-up action to assign legal or political responsibility and the taking of appropriate measures against those responsible. In other words, fact-finding fosters accountability by exposing facts and facilitating accountability-generating processes, thereby also enhancing deterrence.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 10 - [Contribution to the rule of law in international relations]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In doing so, fact-finding mechanisms contribute to the rule of law in international relations.'

Specifically, the legitimacy of the attribution process undergirds the ability of an accuser to convince relevant target audiences, including third States that might join collective attribution statements or support multilateral sanctions.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - [Usefulness of fact-finding mechanisms]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'As explained above, fact-finding provides a basis for legal and political claims. Thus, <strong>fact-finding mechanisms are especially useful in fields where legal compliance is chronically deficient</strong>, such as human rights law, where there is a special need to further legitimize norm-implementation efforts and increase deterrence, or where unique technical challenges present themselves, as in the case of unconventional weapons. Indeed, the use of the OPCW’s technical facilities in connection with the Salisbury incident illustrates the benefits of fact-finding in cases requiring complex scientific analysis, as well as the growing interest of States in internationalizing attribution processes.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - [Viability and value of an international attribution mechanism]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Moving forward, we maintain that the goal of creating an international attribution mechanism remains viable and that such an entity would prove valuable, albeit primarily in three contexts. <strong>First, an international attribution mechanism could prove useful for States with a limited independent capacity to effectively generate accountability.</strong> This includes States that, on the one hand, are sufficiently advanced technologically so as to render them highly vulnerable to hostile cyber operations, but, on the other hand, lack the technological capability to conduct their own forensic investigations and access to high-quality intelligence that can support attribution to a State actor. In this context, an international attribution mechanism could help level the playing field.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - [Need for international support and legitimacy]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Furthermore, <strong>small and mid-size States often lack the diplomatic, economic, technical, or military means to effectively respond</strong>, when appropriate, to hostile cyber operations, thereby making them dependent on their ability to mobilize other States to support them. Yet, relying on other States or private cybersecurity companies for attribution assistance risks having the information provided dismissed as politically biased or profit driven. As a result, it might not generate the level of legitimacy needed to mobilize third States.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - [Benefits of a properly crafted international attribution mechanism]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'An international attribution mechanism could prove especially useful in this regard. A properly crafted mechanism would be more likely to be perceived as independent, impartial, and professionally reliable. <strong>Its factual conclusions would presumably enjoy significant traction</strong>, which would enhance the victim State’s ability to generate assistance in imposing accountability.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - [Growing interest in collective attribution]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Second, the creation of an international attribution mechanism would signal the growing interest of States in collective attribution, as broad condemnation and multilateral responses are more likely to promote accountability than the reactions of a single State. <strong>Collective attribution is most effective when there is a high level of confidence in the initial attribution determination.</strong> Such confidence can derive from close relations among relevant States, such as ongoing cooperation between their intelligence agencies, or through legitimacy-enhancing measures, like transparency.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - [Promoting accountability through credible attribution]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'But in our estimation, an international attribution mechanism would be especially likely to foster collective attribution because of the legitimacy it would presumably enjoy. In particular, a credible attribution process would empower States supportive of the rule of law in international relations to take a principled stand beside the victim State. <strong>The same logic that led to the integration of fact-finding mechanisms in the realm of human rights law to publicly name and shame human rights violators and, in certain cases, to mobilize third States to sanction them</strong> applies mutatis mutandis here.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - [Role in cyber-related sanction regimes]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Third, an international attribution mechanism could play an important role in connection with the operation of cyber-related sanction regimes, such as that of the EU. Such regimes rely upon trust in individual attribution determinations by member States. However, since they involve sanctions on natural or legal actors that may be associated with foreign States, <strong>the smooth operation of the regime generally requires a higher level of confidence than might otherwise be the case with collective attribution.</strong>' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 9 - [Verification of attribution claims]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'An independent professional mechanism could offer verification of individual attribution claims, assuaging the concerns of States about the reliability of the attribution determinations upon which they are being asked to take action. Moreover, since cyber-related sanction regimes like the EU’s have implications under the domestic law of the member States, such as the freezing of assets and travel restrictions, domestic courts may examine the evidence underlying the sanction decision or seek credible assurance that the fact-finding process was independent, fair, and provided those involved an opportunity to contest the findings against them. <strong>An international attribution mechanism could, should it offer features along these lines, help satisfy this demand.</strong>' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 10 - [Conclusion]</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In sum, the configuration of the international attribution mechanism must be responsive to the goal of supporting States facing capacity issues, those interested in collective attribution, and cyber-related sanctions regimes. We believe additional research is called for in order to enumerate and ascertain specific “client” preferences and expectations. <strong>Key institutional design choices would emanate from such mapping of needs.</strong> These include (1) whether the optimal composition is public, private, or hybrid in nature; (2) the triggers to initiation of the mechanism’s investigation; (3) the extent to which a mechanism should be tasked with responsibility beyond technical attribution, such as attribution under the law of State responsibility; (4) the necessary arrangements for access to forensic evidence and intelligence materials, including confidential sharing of information; (5) the opportunity of entities to whom attribution is made to contest evidence collected against them; and (6) whether, and if so when, attribution decisions and supporting evidence should be made public.'

The \"three-level problem of attribution\" creates significant hurdles in applying the existing framework of state responsibility to cyber operations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'There is a “three-level problem of attribution in cyberspace” which inhibits back-tracing the harmful effects of a cyber operation to a responsible State.'

The cyber-attacks of the largest scale commenced at the same time that the Russian military began its operations, and they ended just a while after the Russians accomplished the aims of their campaign so it almost indicates that the operation in cyberspace supplemented those on the ground (Bumgarner – Borg 2009: 6). Asmus (2010: 167) also takes note of a high degree of “discipline, coordination, command, and control” in the cyber-attacks against the Georgian financial and banking sector, which closely followed the kinetic operations on the ground.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Cyber-attacks targeted communication facilities to complement military operations.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'John Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. <strong>They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead.</strong> A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Moreover, many of the attackers’ activities at the beginning of the campaign, such as setting up new websites or registration of new domain names, were carried out with noteworthy speed and readiness. This development suggests that the preparation stage and steps such as the writing of necessary attack scripts must have been done in advance. Bumgarner and Borg (2009: 3) point out that the signal to launch the cyber-attacks was most probably given even before the general public and media were notified about the situation on the ground.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - The defacement of Georgian official websites shows advanced preparation.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The argument concerning the high level of preparedness of the attacks is further elaborated when one studies the defacement of Georgian official websites.</strong> The website of the National Bank of Georgia was defaced during the Russian-Georgian war and replaced with a collage which displayed a gallery of 20th century authoritarians and dictators, including Mikheil Saakashvili. Furthermore, the websites of the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the President of Georgia were defaced with a collage of photographs portraying President Saakashvili and Adolf Hitler in identical postures during their public appearances (Tikk et al. 2008: 7). The preparation of this kind of defacement requires time in order to create the design and find the appropriate photo material.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 3, 4 - The distribution of malicious software and coordination through social networks suggest a high level of planning and sophistication.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Even the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. <strong>Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign.</strong> The fact that the attacked websites’ vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38–39). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites – defacement and denial of service – are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN) in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Social networks quickly became the attackers’ main source of spreading malicious software and instructions as well as recruiting new people and discussing further development.</strong> Almost all of these blogs and forums were written in the Russian language. An example of such a website is stopgeorgia.ru (or alternatively stopgeorgia.info as a redirect), which listed a number of targeted Georgian websites and provided denial of service tools for free download. Danchev (2008) uses the example of stopgeorgia.ru to illustrate that next to the dedicated hacktivists behind the attacks there is also the mass of the unskilled but keen script kiddies who might even serve to mask the real perpetrators. The website stopgeorgia.ru was also studied as part of research carried out by Project Grey Goose, an in-depth Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) initiative launched by a group of independent cyber experts on 22 August 2008 and led by Jeffrey Carr. Its key purpose was to study the ways in which the cyber-attacks against Georgian networks were conducted and whether the Kremlin was involved or whether it was purely an initiative of Russian patriotic hackers (Carr 2008: 2). While the researchers from Project Grey Goose claim that evidence such as that of advance preparation and reconnaissance suggests that Russian military or government officials primed hackers for the cyber-attacks, they also add that they could not find any direct proof which would confirm the link between the Kremlin and the stopgeorgia.ru website administrators or the attackers on Georgian computer networks in general. Nevertheless, they still defend their opinion and note that “it is not reasonable to conclude that no such connection exists”, pointing to the fact that past experience has already demonstrated support by the Russian government for Russian hacker attacks and its passive consent to the attacks, which was implied in its refusal to stop them (Carr 2008: 8; also see Krebs 2008).'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB Colonel until his defection to the British MI6 in 1985, openly explained to the public at an international conference in 1998 how hackers convicted of cyber-crimes in Russia are occasionally offered an alternative to imprisonment – employing their technological skills and working for the Russian FSB (Krebs 2008). Khatuna Mshvidobadze (2011) highlights another example of such suspicious Russian cyber activities – the Russian internationally-known “hacker schools”, where tuition fees are often paid by unspecified donors. One of such hacker education institutions in Russia is supposedly run by the former Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information (FAPSI) in Voronezh. Moreover, Khaker: Computer Hooligan Magazine is particularly popular among the young generation in Russia, where any print content unacceptable to the Kremlin usually suffers from serious existential obstacles (Mshvidobadze 2011). Hence, it appears that Russia has a great potential to preserve its status as a cyber-crime power.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 3, 4 - The Russian government influences and controls youth organisations to enhance cyber capabilities.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Furthermore, the Russian government does not rely merely on social trends and the development of Russian society but it attempts to influence and control the young generations, which also have a strong cyber security potential, through youth organisations and movements.</strong> The most notorious one is the Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement “Ours!” (Molodezhnoye Demokraticheskoye Antifashistskoye Dvizhenye in Russian), also known as Nashi. Nashi was founded in 2005 with two main goals: firstly, it was meant as a counterweight to the growing popularity of Nazi ideology in the Russian Federation. Secondly, it was supposed to be a political tool to help Russia avoid a similar youth revolt like the one which evolved during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 (Atwal 2009). Although it officially claims to be funded by Russian business elites, speculations exist which claim that it gains its finances from the Kremlin (Carr 2011, Betz – Stevens 2011: 32). The purported link between Nashi and the Russian government is also based on other strong evidence. For example, in the late 2000s Vladislav Surkov, the then First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff and one of the closest co-workers of Vladimir Putin, was a very keen supporter of Nashi. He even proclaimed the intention to use Nashi’s computer skills to enhance the will of the Kremlin in Russian cyberspace and to “ensure the domination of pro-Kremlin views on the Internet” (Carr 2009: 21). A practical example of this proclamation was reported in February 2009, when the Russian media published a story uncovering how the government encourages and funds the establishment of Russian youth organisations that are to get involved in cyber operations, including hacking and the subsequent suppression of opposition groups (Carr 2009: 21). Similarly, in 2009 Sergei Markov, a then State Duma Deputy, released the information that his assistant, most probably Konstantin Goloskov, a Nashi Commissar, had participated as one of the leaders in a cyber-attack against Estonia two years earlier (Carr 2009: 22). Thus, it appears that the Kremlin might be taking advantage of its very good relations with the youth organisations and their technologically educated and talented individual members as well.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

However, the other two objectives distinguish Russia from most of the democratic world: “to protect against deleterious foreign information and to inculcate in the people patriotism and values” (Smith 2012: 2–3). This doctrine has then settled a broader Russian cyber security framework for both the military and civilian spheres for the next decade.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Russia's cyber security concerns include content influence and internet sovereignty.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents – the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001).</strong> The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives “the use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere” as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65–66).'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Russian military doctrine emphasizes the strategic value of cyber-attacks.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The Russian military command has adopted a similar approach.</strong> Security experts notice that the Russian armed forces have recently put a growing emphasis on cyber-attacks in their military doctrine, acknowledging their strategic value (e.g. Giles 2011: 50). Russia has accordingly adopted a broad cyber warfare doctrine, paying particular attention to offensive cyber weapons. The Russian cyber warfare approach is developed as a “force multiplier” (Schaap 2009: 133), a military tool which, when employed together with other combat forces, increases the potential and effect of that military force. In theory, this would mean that Russia’s cyber strategy includes disruptions of the enemy’s critical infrastructure, civilian and military communications capabilities or financial markets prior to or alongside a traditional military campaign on the ground (Schaap 2009: 133). Therefore, the combined kinetic and cyber campaign against Georgia in the summer of 2008 appears to be the first diffident implementation of the Russian military cyber strategy in practice. Although the attack focussed mostly on the suppression of Georgian strategic communication, not the national critical infrastructure, it still caused enormous psychological harm and contributed to the destabilisation of Georgia’s nation in a critical time of danger.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - The study applies international legal concepts to cyberspace, favoring the overall control doctrine.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The article works with the international legal concepts of attribution and state responsibility and transfers them into an analysis of international relations.</strong> It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine. In the overall control doctrine, it suffices to find a proof of an operational control or support coming from a state to invoke state responsibility, which lowers the necessary threshold of evidence. Thus, our judgement could draw from the more common indirect evidence rather than from the oftentimes lacking direct evidence.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - The study's categorization is based on the 2008 Russian-Georgian conflict.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The proposed categorisation of indirect evidence is based on an analysis of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008.</strong> On the one hand, the Russian government and officials have officially denied any engagement in the cyber-attacks and there is no first-hand evidence proving their involvement. On the other hand, as a number of pieces of indirect evidence illustrate, it is most likely that the Kremlin encouraged the attacks and provided the attackers with the necessary information to coordinate the cyber and kinetic operations. This particular case study was chosen because it provides one of the richest arrays of indirect evidence of various kinds, illustrating the flexibility of this form of proof in comparison to investigating cyber-attacks solely with a focus on direct evidence.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - The timing and coordination of cyber-attacks are key indicators of state involvement.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The first category of significant indirect proof which can be considered during the process of attribution is the timing and coordination of the cyber-attacks.</strong> The more the attack’s timing is orchestrated and the more it appears to be well-coordinated overall, the higher the probability of a state’s involvement. A telling sign is how well the cyber-attacks are coordinated with events outside of cyberspace, especially when they are not publicly predictable, as a conventional military campaign would be. In such cases, the cyber-attacks can easily supplement the operations on the ground and multiply their effect. Without at least a certain degree of exchange of information between a sponsoring state and the perpetrators, a cyber campaign cannot be well-timed and coordinated.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - The level of preparedness of cyber-attacks indicates state involvement.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>A similar logic can be observed in regard to the second category of indirect proof – the level of preparedness.</strong> A number of different types of cyber-attacks require time for situation mapping, reconnaissance and implementation so that they reach the necessary sophistication and maximum psychological effect. For instance, the right offensive graphics or collage of pictures posted on a defaced ministerial website may cause not only a denial of information to citizens, but also an offensive effect targeting the citizens’ psychology. To reach a certain level of sophistication in this respect, the perpetrators would need to receive intelligence from a state source and plan such cyber-attacks well in advance.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Long-term relations between state institutions and the national hacker community indicate state responsibility.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>The third category of indirect evidence to investigate is the long-term relations between the state institutions and the national hacker community.</strong> For example, in countries with a long and prosperous history of criminal networks, criminal mobs oftentimes follow up on their usual activities with their malicious activities in cyberspace and thus might become convenient partners for a sponsoring state, especially if they can build on previously established contacts. A similar example is the case of youth organisations with a pro-government ideology and government contacts which unite young people with a talent for IT who are eager to support their state’s activities.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - State cyber-security doctrines can indicate state inclinations towards offensive cyber operations.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'<strong>Finally, the fourth category of indirect proof is the state conception of cyber security.</strong> The political, non-military national strategies and concepts of cyberspace are the first indicators suggesting the state’s approach and behaviour in the cyber environment. Even more telling is the study of the military doctrines of the state, as they may indicate whether the state has inclinations toward building and using offensive cyber weapons or employing cyber-attacks as a force multiplier alongside conventional warfare.'【23:0†(Lucie Kadlecová, 2018).pdf】</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Yet one approach to this problem has not been analyzed in depth: the use of criminal charges to allege or suggest state responsibility for cyber incidents. The United States has increasingly used this instrument since 2014. Its Department of Justice in fact adopted an explicit goal of bringing charges against foreign actors responsible for cyber activity. <strong>Federal prosecutors have unsealed a series of indictments and criminal charges against Chinese intelligence officers involved in the theft of intellectual property and Iranian and North Korean individuals who carried out destructive cyber attacks on behalf of their governments.</strong> This also includes charges against Russian intelligence officers alleged to have interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Criminal charges raise questions about their goals and effectiveness</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'This increasing number of criminal charges raises several important questions: <strong>What are the goals of these criminal charges, especially those against foreign intelligence officers unlikely ever to be arrested by U.S. law enforcement?</strong> Are criminal charges merely a more formal approach to alleging state responsibility than leaking statements from \"senior administration officials\" to the media about cyber threats from other states? And how should this strategy of bringing criminal charges be evaluated in the context of broader U.S. policy efforts to combat malicious cyber activity? How does it interact with the Justice Department's stance of independence from political considerations?'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - First instance of U.S. public criminal charges alleging state involvement in cyber activity</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        '<strong>The U.S. first publicly brought criminal charges that explicitly alleged that a foreign state played a role in malicious cyber activity in 2014</strong>, with charges against five officers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) for stealing intellectual property (IP) from a number of U.S. companies, including Westinghouse.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Increasing number of charges against individuals from various countries</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Since then, the Justice Department has brought or unsealed twenty-three additional sets of charges, <strong>some of which specifically alleged foreign state responsibility for online influence operations</strong>, a category often discussed in tandem with malicious cyber activity.

The prosecutors must then be prepared to prove at a later stage, before a jury, that the defendant is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This is a higher burden of proof - and proof that must lay out its evidence in public and be challenged in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury - compared to the standards of information on which policymakers usually make decisions in the national security space.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - Individual-centric nature of criminal charges creates challenges and opportunities</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Second, <strong>criminal charges are individual-centric</strong>. This raises both challenges and opportunities for policymakers, since the primary question of interest from a foreign policy perspective is not which person carried out the attack but which state is responsible. For instance, when the FBI attributed the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, it noted the North Korean government was responsible for the attack - but did not name any individuals.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Criminal charges are a necessary predicate for law enforcement actions</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Third, <strong>criminal charges are a necessary predicate for law enforcement actions</strong>. This is obvious - federal authorities generally need a grand jury indictment to make an arrest. In this way, unsealed criminal charges both communicate about a cyber incident and form a basis for action in response, specifically against the charged individuals. This is a significant difference from other responses like public statements.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

In most cases, criminal charges serve multiple ends, and they do this with varying effectiveness. Sometimes, the different purposes complement each other, and other times they are at odds. For example, when an indictment is kept under seal in the hope of making an arrest, it does not have the public communicative functions described below. The next section discusses how criminal charges contribute to broader policy efforts by publicizing attribution, satisfying domestic audiences that can include victims, punishing the responsible individuals, disrupting ongoing or future malicious activity, naming and shaming adversary states, cooperating with allies, and contributing to the formation of international norms of behavior.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Criminal charges can publicize attribution and respond to pressure for action</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the short term, immediate response to a cyber incident, the primary purpose of unsealing criminal charges relates to attribution. <strong>It is worth noting that before the series of criminal charges began in 2014, there was a prominent debate in academic and technical communities about the feasibility of attributing state-backed cyber activities</strong>, with literature around 2014 arguing that better attribution was possible but not yet demonstrated. In late 2014, when the FBI publicly attributed the Sony hack to North Korea, this prior sense of uncertainty provoked some controversy about the validity of that attribution.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'First, criminal charges can directly attribute activity to a target state. <strong>This was the case with the hack of Yahoo! where the indictment revealed that Russian intelligence officers had broken into the email provider.</strong> In these cases, criminal charges do not provide an initial attribution but can provide clarity to the technical community when disputed attributions exist.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Criminal charges can disrupt malicious activity and influence state-proxy relationships</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Second, attributions - and particularly attributions in the form of criminal charges - can respond to pressure from the private sector to \"do something\" in response. <strong>Often, companies find that disclosing that the perpetrator behind a massive breach or attack on their services is a nation state can help to avoid hard questions about their security and instead focus attention on how the U.S. government can protect them.</strong> In the case of the 2011-2013 distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against major U.S. financial institutions, the March 2016 indictment against a cadre of Iranian hackers was largely in response to demands from big banks for the U.S. to take some kind of public action in response.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In the medium-term, the purposes of criminal charges relate to disruption and diplomacy. <strong>First, criminal charges can have direct purposes related to disrupting malicious activity.</strong> Criminal charges let law enforcement authorities seize persons or property, including online infrastructure, like web domains or online accounts, involved in the operations, as discussed above. However, public criminal charges of state-linked hackers often do not lead to arrests because the hackers are safe in the target state or in countries with no extradition treaty with the United States. In these cases, the public disclosure of the alleged hackers' tools and techniques is helpful to the technical community in both attributing and defending against activity from the same threat actor. Criminal charges may help motivate the adoption of security measures based upon shared technical information - for instance, an alert from the U.S-CERT would be more ideal to share indicators of compromise (IOC) - which may not be relevant to the specific criminal charges but would be key information to defend against further activity by the same actor.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Criminal charges can impact state-proxy relationships and incentivize state control</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In addition, criminal charges could potentially have a disruptive effect on the target state's relationship with its proxies. <strong>Since the hackers that work for U.S. adversaries like Russia and Iran are often not official government employees but instead operate out of front companies with varying degrees of state oversight, calling out individuals puts them in an uncomfortable spotlight.</strong> Criminal charges impose costs on individuals; even if they are not arrested, they cannot travel or do business in the United States or countries which may cooperate with U.S. law enforcement, such as those countries with an extradition treaty with the U.S. Public charges may expose individuals as being in the employ of intelligence or security services, which may have a reputational cost. And those security services may not want to employ those hackers in the future. In the medium-term, this could have an effect of either distancing those proxies from the target state or dissuading other hackers from signing up to work as proxies. Under slightly different circumstances, criminal charges can have a converse purpose: they can aim to incentivize states to reassert control over their proxies, whose activities may not have endorsement from top policymakers. For instance, the criminal charges of criminal hacker groups operating out of Syria and Iran which are clearly tacitly tolerated by their respective governments, could be a way of showing that the U.S. has taken interest in the groups and would like to pressure the regimes to stop their activities.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

First, they must decide whether to bring charges at all. If they do so, they then must consider whether to explicitly allege foreign state responsibility - a fraught question for all the reasons discussed in this article. Next, should prosecutors keep the indictment under seal in order to potentially arrest those charged or make the charges public? How should they time the public release of the charges to maximize their impacts? Furthermore, prosecutors also have the option of using other policy tools like an INTERPOL Red Notice, civil enforcement, or working with policymakers to bring sanctions, diplomatic action or other tools to bear.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The other options in the policy toolbox often provide alternatives or complements for an indictment. One model for thinking about this toolbox is the DIME(LE) framework, which comprises the various elements of statecraft: diplomacy, information, military, economy, and law enforcement. <strong>As applied to state-sponsored hacking, the other available tools in the DIME(LE) model include policies like focused diplomatic engagement - which in part led to the 2015 U.S.-China cyber espionage agreement - and economic tools such as sanctions.</strong> Justice Department officials have often raised the point that law enforcement action can be accompanied with other policy options for countering illicit activities.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Justice Department's prosecutorial independence can complicate coordination with other policy tools</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'However, applying the DIME(LE) framework to criminal charges points to some issues. <strong>The Justice Department fiercely guards its prosecutorial independence</strong>, which could raise problems, for example, for the State Department's efforts to calm a relationship when criminal charges could ignite acrimony. In practice, this has meant that the Justice Department independently decides whether or not to bring criminal charges. With that said, the timing of unsealing those charges may be subject to interagency discussions among a very small group of officials from the White House and the Departments of State, Treasury, and Commerce to provide awareness and enable relevant preparations, e.g. implications for diplomatic relationships.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Criminal charges may not always complement other policy efforts</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In other instances, criminal charges fit with the broader goals - for instance, to put pressure on a state to stop its hacking - and it is crucial that the timing of a criminal charge help and not hinder other efforts to use available policy tools. <strong>Considering the whole concept of using all levers of government power, some social science literature argues that using multiple tools of social influence will reinforce each other in some instances.</strong> In other instances, multiple tools of influence may change conditions or socialize their targets in such a way as to have a completely counterproductive effect.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Criminal charges vary in effectiveness based on the target audience and behavior</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        '<strong>Additionally, criminal charges are not 'one-size-fits-all.'</strong> Criminal charges will have vastly different effects based on the target audience. For example, the Chinese government will react in a way that differs from how Iranian proxy groups for the IRGC will respond. In addition, different kinds of malicious behavior, such as election interference, intellectual property theft, extortion, or intrusions on critical infrastructure, may require different responses, and criminal charges may be an appropriate policy tool for only some. Of course, the U.S. criminal code limits in some respects the charges that the Justice Department can bring because the Justice Department can only charge hackers with violations of laws currently in force. Further, in their deliberations, prosecutors must consider other factors, such as the number of individuals the Justice Department could charge, their status as either government officials, military officers, or non-state proxies, and finally, whether they are located in countries where authorities could arrest and extradite them.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The May 2014 indictment supported a broader strategy by the U.S. government that included further threats highlighting that Chinese cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets had become a top priority in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship. In addition, in June 2014, Canadian authorities arrested a Chinese national, Su Bin, on a U.S. extradition request. Bin worked at a small aerospace firm and had provided inside information to military hackers in China that allowed them to exfiltrate specific files of valuable data about the development of the C-17 military cargo plane and the F-35 joint strike fighter.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Subsequent indictments and arrests underlined U.S. pressure on China over economic espionage</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Although this arrest did not receive the publicity of the PLA indictment, later reporting indicated that Chinese officials took this as an even more significant move. Subsequently, President Obama and President Xi reached the landmark 2015 U.S.-China cyber economic espionage agreement and cybersecurity companies reported a significant drop in Chinese cyber thefts from U.S. companies.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Since 2015, the charges have followed a track that has aimed at steadily increasing pressure. <strong>The next indictment came after a gap of more than three years, in August 2017, when prosecutors in Los Angeles arrested a Chinese national, Yu Pingan, for hacking three different companies by using a malware variant linked to the OPM hack.</strong> The charges against Pingan did not mention the OPM hack, just the malware variant, noting that it was a rare type. That November, federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh unsealed an indictment of three employees at the Chinese company Boyusec. The indictment charged the Boyusec employees with stealing trade secrets from Siemens, Moody's Analytics, and Trimble but importantly, did not make an explicit allegation of state sponsorship (although press reporting and security researchers identified links between Boyusec and China's Ministry of State Security (MSS)).'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - The 2018 trade report and subsequent charges indicate ongoing Chinese economic espionage</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'In early 2018, a major report by the U.S. Trade Representative accused China of ramping up economic espionage, using this as a justification for the imposition of the first round of tariffs in the U.S.-China trade war. As reciprocal rounds of tariffs mounted in value to the hundreds of billions of dollars, in the fall the U.S. unsealed a series of criminal charges focusing on MSS-linked hackers. However, the first set of charges in this series actually did not involve hacking. Belgian authorities extradited a senior MSS officer, Yanjun Xu, to the U.S. on charges related to stealing trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation and aerospace firms.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Indictments in 2018 highlighted the significance of Chinese cyber espionage</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'Two weeks later, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against two officers in the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security (a regional branch of the MSS) and five hackers they recruited to break into a U.S.-French joint aerospace venture to steal engine-related technology designs. <strong>The Justice Department timed these charges with another indictment two days later against a Chinese company for conspiring to steal semiconductor technology, although this case did not involve cyber-enabled theft.</strong> At this announcement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \"China Initiative\" to combat Chinese-sponsored trade secrets thefts.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'At this point, the U.S. had not formally accused China of violating the 2015 agreement. This was because the actual agreement was narrow - the two nations said they would not employ cyber-enabled espionage to benefit private sector firms. Criminal charges brought to this date either charged non-cyber espionage or named activity that stopped before September 2015. <strong>This changed with the Justice Department's December indictment of two MSS officers in connection with a wide-ranging scheme over 12 years to hack managed services providers, which served as IT infrastructure for hundreds of companies.</strong> This campaign, dubbed \"Cloudhopper\" by the cybersecurity teams at PwC and BAE Systems, was one of the most significant and damaging sprees of economic espionage. With the indictment, the U.S. had concrete evidence, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen used as the basis of a joint statement alleging that China violated the accord. Moreover, twelve close U.S. allies joined in issuing statements condemning China's behavior.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - The China charges focus on economic espionage</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        'The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. <strong>These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20.</strong> However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like-minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.'\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This was because the indictment was against Evgeniy Bogachev, the administrator of the GameOverZeus botnet, and the Justice Department unsealed the charges concurrently with a major international operation to take down the botnet. Only later reporting and sanctions on Bogachev announced in 2016 revealed that Bogachev was using the botnet to siphon information about Russian intelligence targets as well as to steal bank information. The FBI had discovered this before taking down the botnet, and so the planned takedown, which originally just aimed to stop a major criminal operation, also served to disrupt a Russian intelligence gathering effort.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Prosecutors have named and charged officers in Russia's security services for their roles in cyber crimes</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Prosecutors have named and charged officers in Russia's security services, the GRU and FSB, in three out of the five sets of charges</strong>, starting with the March 2017 indictment of two FSB officers and two cyber criminals for their roles in the hack of Yahoo!. This indictment was also significant because it revealed that Russia had employed cyber criminals to assist in carrying out the actual hacking of Yahoo!. It further led to the arrest of one of these criminals, Karim Baratov, in Canada and his subsequent extradition, which was an example of the effectiveness of criminal charges at locking up proxies.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>In 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election led to three separate criminal indictments</strong> - one in July against seven GRU officers for their role in hacking the DNC and Clinton campaign's emails and releasing them. This indictment paralleled other cyber indictments by focusing on unauthorized access to a computer, i.e. hacking. But the other two sets of charges, the first in February against the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and thirteen of its employees, and the second in October against Elena Khusyaynova, the chief accountant for the broader influence program of which the IRA was a part, focused on social media disinformation activities. To bring the charges, prosecutors relied on an innovative approach alleging a conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws. The IRA cases have also provoked one of the only contested litigation resulting from cyber indictments: a court battle between the company Concord Management and Consulting (which owned the IRA) and the Mueller investigation.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - The Russia charges demonstrated the Justice Department's prosecutorial independence</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>These three sets of charges resulted from the special counsel's office and demonstrated the Justice Department's prosecutorial independence</strong>, even contradicting President Trump's repeated dismissals of Russia's election interference efforts. In addition, these cases also had significant importance for Congress and the public because of the Russia investigation's political salience.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - The October 2018 indictment joined with allies in condemning Russia's activities</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The fifth indictment came in October 2018, when the Justice Department unsealed charges against four more GRU officers</strong> (and three of the same from Mueller's charges) for hacking into the WADA, the OPCW, the international soccer association FIFA, and many other targets. With this indictment, the U.S. joined with its allies in condemning Russia's activities. The UK and the Netherlands issued a strong joint statement, focusing particularly on how the hacking was aimed at discrediting the investigation into the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in early 2018. One practical effect of these charges was, as iterated, that these operatives could not travel in the future to U.S.-allied countries - which several Russian GRU officers in fact did, going to the Netherlands to attempt to surveil the OPCW. Interestingly, the Netherlands apprehended the officers but did not extradite them to the U.S., likely because at that time (April 2018), the Justice Department did not have sealed charges against them ready. Instead, they expelled them since the officers were carrying diplomatic passports, and Dutch authorities explained that their counter effort was a military, not police operation.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Russia took efforts to investigate the Skripal attack and doping program seriously</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The October 2018 indictment also pointed to an interesting behavior: the Russian government took the OPCW's efforts to investigate the Skripal attack and WADA's investigations of its doping program seriously enough to try to hack those organizations and try to discredit them.</strong> Naming and shaming pressured Russia to do something, except that something was more aggressive hacking to discredit shaming efforts, supporting the already-sizeable body of evidence that Russia was responsible for the Skripal attack.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - The policy value of the Russia charges lies in their effects on individuals and disrupting relationships with proxies</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The policy value of the Russia charges may be in their effects against individuals and in disrupting Russia's relationships with its proxies</strong> - for instance, in how the Yahoo! hack led to Baratov's arrest and how the Bogachev indictment contributed to the GameOver Zeus takedown. In the last eighteen months, the Department of Justice has stepped up its efforts to indict and obtain extraditions of Russian hackers, some of whom may know about Russian government cyber activities. As a rogue state, Russia is unlikely to take naming and shaming efforts seriously. Rather, the value of the indictments lies in their ability to demonstrate the U.S.' desire to uphold international norms to the audience of other states and potentially to enlist international collaboration, as in the OPCW indictment. Further, in the long-term, the three cases related to Russia's operations during the 2016 election may contribute to building a stronger norm against cyber-enabled election interference.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Analysts at the time said the attacks were in response to U.S. sanctions on Iran's nuclear program and to the Stuxnet virus's attack on Iran's uranium enrichment facilities. At the time of the attacks, U.S. officials attributed them to Iran and the press reported on this attribution, but the U.S. did not make a public allegation. In late 2017, prosecutors in New York unsealed charges against Behzad Mesri, an Iranian who had previously worked for the Iranian military, for hacking into HBO and threatening to release episodes of \"Game of Thrones\" unless he was paid $6 million.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In March 2018, the Justice Department unsealed another indictment against a group of Iranian hackers called the Mabna Institute linked to the IRGC, in this instance for a spear phishing campaign stealing IP and data from universities, federal and state agencies, and global NGOs. <strong>According to the indictment, this activity campaign lasted from 2013 through December 2017, and targeted over 176 universities around the world</strong>, including 144 based in the U.S.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Iranian reliance on proxies complicates U.S. efforts to counter cyber threats</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>One major difference between charges against Iran-linked hackers and those against Russian and Chinese-linked hackers is that none of the charges are against officers or officials in the Iranian government</strong>. This may be because Iran relies on proxies to a greater degree than China or Russia, and those proxies have a greater degree of freedom from tighter state direction and control. Time will tell whether restrictions on those indicted proxies' abilities to travel and have a career outside of Iran will alter Iran's ability to recruit more young and talented hackers. There is also less of a clear trend in the type of malicious activity - which ranges from DDoS attacks to IP theft to the hack-and-release strategy of the HBO hacker - and consequently, it is harder to make conclusions about the indictments' relevance to the larger U.S.-Iran relationship.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - U.S. indictments reflect changing dynamics in the U.S.-Iran relationship</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>There are some clear points of correspondence</strong> - for instance, the pardon for Golestaneh as part of the detente following the nuclear deal, and the Mabna indictment as tensions increased following the Trump administration's withdrawal from the deal. But there are also outliers, such as the March 2016 DDoS indictment, which as the previous sections discussed, partially responded to pressure from major banks to respond to the attacks on their services. In late 2018 and early 2019, some analysts predicted and then observed more significant Iranian hacking as a response to the withdrawal from the nuclear deal, so more anti-Iran criminal charges may be in the works.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Although the Justice Department did not accuse the Syrian government of direct activity in support of the Syrian Electronic Army, it said they carried out the attacks on behalf of the Assad regime. The charges led to the arrest of one individual, Peter Romar, in Germany, who was extradited to the U.S. to face charges related to the extortion scheme. In May 2018, the Justice Department unsealed a new set of charges against the two remaining Syrians that detailed their efforts to hack U.S. social media organizations and deface their websites.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Indictments against Iranian cybercriminals for ransomware campaigns targeting U.S. cities and organizations</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Second, in November 2018, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment accusing two Iranian men of conducting a ransomware extortion campaign against city governments in Atlanta and Newark</strong>, the port of San Diego, U.S. hospitals, and other U.S. nonprofits.

The Justice Department brought the charges as nuclear negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea appeared to stagnate. In response to the charges, a North Korean spokesperson said, \"[t]he U.S. should seriously ponder over the negative consequences of circulating falsehoods and inciting antagonism against the DPRK that may affect the implementation of the joint statement adopted at the DPRK-U.S. summit.\"' </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The clearest impact of the charges is that they confirmed the original 2014 attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and added a voluminous amount of technical data reinforcing the U.S. government's attribution of the WannaCry worm. <strong>Although the charges provoked discussions among the U.S. cybersecurity technical community about the initial approach and the skepticism some had regarding the FBI's 2014 attribution of the Sony hack</strong>, this discussion had little policy relevance because almost four years had passed.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - The charges had more domestic impact than foreign policy relevance</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In terms of diplomacy, the timing was curious given the ongoing nuclear negotiations. <strong>Other than providing justice for victims, any foreign policy purpose is unclear.</strong> One early indication in that regard is the FBI's warning to U.S. companies in October that North Korea \"will continue to target financial institutions\" despite the indictment, which supports the argument that the charges had more domestic than foreign policy purposes.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Concerns about the human rights implications of the charges</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Lastly, some commentators raised the potential human rights implications of the charges, <strong>arguing that the response of North Korea's regime would be to imprison, disappear, or kill the named hacker to make him a \"non-entity.\"</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Internationally, criminal charges like the PLA indictment, the OPCW/WADA indictment, and the Cloudhopper indictment, provoked consequences in the target state and helped to mobilize allies to condemn the target state's behavior. Domestically, the Yahoo! indictment and the Syrian Electronic Army indictment provided attribution of significant cyber incidents, helping to clarify the perpetrators to the public and to victims.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Prior attribution leads to less diplomatic impact and more domestic relevance</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>For criminal charges that had prior attribution, there were less clear diplomatic impacts</strong> - for instance, the Sony and WannaCry indictment and DNC indictment both responded to very significant incidents, but they did not much alter the U.S. relationship with the target state. Their effects may have been more important domestically because of their political salience, but the criminal charges themselves did not reveal much new, relevant information to the public.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'A notable exception to this trend is the PLA indictment, which had significant international and domestic consequences. The 2014 indictment of five Chinese military officers marked the first time that the U.S. government had publicly attributed cyber espionage to a foreign state. The indictment played a crucial role in U.S. efforts to build an international consensus against economic espionage and led to the 2015 U.S.-China cyber agreement, which was a major diplomatic achievement at the time.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - The OPCW/WADA indictment demonstrated the value of collaboration with allies</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'The OPCW/WADA indictment, which involved collaboration with U.S. allies, demonstrated the value of using criminal charges as a tool to galvanize international condemnation of state-sponsored cyber activities. <strong>This case illustrated how criminal charges could be part of a broader strategy to align international actors against norm violators.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Attribution's impact on disinformation operations and political climate</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'While analysts generally perceive attribution as a positive step, <strong>there are some situations where it could be disadvantageous</strong>. For instance, Jack Goldsmith has argued that attributing the 2016 election disinformation operations to the Russian government may actually have enhanced the perceived impact of those operations. In cases of incidents with significant political valence, policymakers should take into context how detailed criminal charges could affect the political climate, especially for information operations.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Importance of strategic use of criminal charges in policy</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'The discussion concludes by emphasizing the importance of strategically using criminal charges in conjunction with other policy tools. <strong>While criminal charges are a powerful tool for attribution and signaling, they must be integrated thoughtfully within a broader strategy that considers diplomatic, economic, and other responses.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

As a result, for all its virtues, cyberspace remains a domain in which the actions of unscrupulous States and opportunistic hackers can threaten peace and security internationally. In the absence of an effective State responsibility regime, a strong commitment to existing international law and respect for the rule of law can wane. <strong>But as Toomas Hendrik Ilves, former President of Estonia, stated in his foreword to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is misleading to dismiss international law as ‘window-dressing on realpolitik’.</strong> This article contends that adopting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace would be an effective means of ensuring that cyber operations are appropriately governed by the international law framework of State responsibility.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Due diligence as a standard of attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'While the attention of some has moved to ‘second generation’ cyberspace issues, such as the operation and enforcement of obligations, attribution continues to be an unresolved precondition of legal responsibility. <strong>Furthermore, those who have dealt with attribution in cyberspace have often done so in a perfunctory way.</strong> This article seeks to offer a comprehensive account of the due diligence principle and its relevance to State responsibility in the cyber context.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - General acceptance of due diligence in cyberspace</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The general applicability of due diligence to the cyber domain is not disputed. On the contrary, <strong>it has been widely accepted that States must not allow their territory to be used for cyber operations which produce serious adverse consequences for other States.</strong> However, it is generally assumed that when a State fails to act with due diligence, it is merely responsible for a procedural failing. This is the view adopted by the International Group of Experts (IGE) who prepared the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the most recent and notable attempt at an ‘objective restatement of the lex lata’ pertaining to cyber operations.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Distinguishing due diligence from international wrongfulness</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Specifically, the Experts were ‘careful to distinguish application of the due diligence principle from the international wrongfulness of the particular cyber operation that has been mounted from … the State’s territory’. <strong>They did so because they considered that the question of attribution was dealt with exhaustively by the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (Articles on State Responsibility).</strong> In the lexicon of the International Law Commission (ILC), the IGE treated the due diligence principle as a primary rule of international law, which gave content to an international obligation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Argument for due diligence as a secondary rule</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This article departs from the conclusion of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 in this regard. Instead, <strong>it is argued that due diligence should operate as a secondary rule of international law, setting out a general condition for State responsibility in the context of cyberspace.</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - The definition and implications of due diligence failure</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A due diligence failure occurs when a State has knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, contrary to the rights of another State, and fails to take reasonable measures to prevent it. <strong>In such cases, the unlawful cyber operation should be attributable to the State, which would then incur responsibility for any resulting violation of international law.</strong> The purpose of formulating due diligence as a secondary rule in this way is the promotion of peace and security in the international system.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - Increasing state accountability through due diligence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Making the attribution of cyber operations to States less difficult increases the potential accountability of States for nefarious cyber activities that they might tolerate within their territory, or carry out themselves. <strong>Were due diligence to operate as a primary rule of international law, as contemplated by the IGE, this could not be as effectively achieved.</strong> In particular, the regime of countermeasures provided for in international law could not be fully relied upon by States seeking to resolve cyber-related disputes.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 8 - Overview of the article's structure</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The remainder of Part I identifies the limitations of applying the existing attribution framework to cyber operations and addresses alternative scholarly responses to this problem. <strong>The following three parts then consider in more detail the content (Part II), the rationale (Part III), and the source (Part IV) of the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution in cyberspace.</strong>'</blockquote>"

Conduct will be attributed to a State if there is a sufficient nexus between the actor who carried out the conduct, and the State. That nexus is satisfied when the actor is a State organ, a person exercising government authority, or is under the direction or control of the State. However, this framework is frustrated in the context of cyber operations. In particular, <strong>there is a ‘three-level problem of attribution in cyberspace’ which inhibits back-tracing the harmful effects of a cyber operation to a responsible State.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - Identifying the computer used in cyber operations is challenging due to the possibility of IP address masking and spoofing.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'First, there is the challenge of identifying which computer or computers were used to carry out a cyber operation. Computer identification is only possible because a computer’s IP address is unique, and in some cases this can be traced to reveal its precise location. However, it is possible for an actor to mask their IP address when carrying out harmful cyber operations. Moreover, actors can use network modification techniques to ‘spoof’ their identity, feigning the IP address of a computer in a location different to that where it actually is. The internet, as has been observed, is ‘one big masquerade ball’, where actors ‘hide behind aliases … [and] can surreptitiously enslave other computers.’</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Identifying the individual behind the computer in a cyber operation is difficult, creating a 'human machine gap'.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Second, even if the computer used to carry out a cyber operation can be identified, this is of limited utility for the purposes of attribution. As attribution is predicated on the nexus between an actor and a State, attribution cannot be made out unless the person who was operating the computer can also be identified. Naturally, the ‘location of a computer rarely allows for definite conclusions regarding the identity of the individual operating the machine.’ <strong>This difficulty has been termed the ‘human machine gap.’</strong> It is for this reason that the mere fact that a cyber operation is carried out on a State’s territory, or from a State’s governmental cyber infrastructure, is insufficient to attribute the operation to that State.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Legal nexus issues remain problematic even after identifying the actor responsible for a cyber operation.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Third, even if an actor responsible for a cyber operation were identified, attribution would only occur in those cases where there was a sufficient legal nexus between that actor and the State. <strong>Problems of attribution at this third level of analysis are not peculiar to the cyber context.</strong> Similar difficulties arise whenever it is asserted that the State is responsible for the conduct of an individual actor, and the Articles on State Responsibility are designed to address them. It is, therefore, the unique challenges presented by the first two levels of analysis—locating and identifying the computer and actor responsible for a harmful cyber operation—which cause the shortcomings of the existing State responsibility framework in the cyber context.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Active and sophisticated non-State actors complicate attribution in cyberspace, often acting with varying degrees of State support.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A further complicating factor for the attribution of conduct in cyberspace is the presence of active and sophisticated non-State actors. <strong>These actors largely sit outside the scope of the framework of the Articles on State Responsibility, and so enjoy a relative degree of impunity for the harmful consequences of their conduct.</strong> Additionally, they will often act ‘in varying degrees of support for particular States and their policy objectives.’ Therefore, great caution is needed when drawing inferences from surrounding political and contextual circumstances concerning the source of a particular cyber operation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - Challenges in distinguishing State-sponsored cyber operations from those by patriotic non-State hackers.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'This is especially the case given that States are presumed to act in accordance with their international legal obligations. What might, at first glance, appear to be a State-sponsored cyber operation could in fact be the work of a patriotic (but non-State) hacker. In this way, <strong>an adequate legal response to the challenges of attribution in cyberspace must address two problems</strong>: first, when States carry out harmful cyber operations for strategic purposes they should be held responsible for their conduct despite the difficulties outlined above; and second, when non-State actors carry out harmful cyber operations, targeted States should, in appropriate circumstances, be able to have recourse to international law mechanisms for remedy and dispute resolution.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - Limited success of State-based efforts in codifying international law for cyberspace through the UN GGE.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'State-based efforts to address this problem have been met with limited success. <strong>The chief vehicle for the codification, by States, of international law pertaining to cyberspace was the work of the United Nations’ Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.</strong> The GGE produced three reports between 2010 and 2015, which represented the unanimous views of State-participants in the GGE process.'</blockquote>"

In particular, <strong>it has been argued that rules of evidence are the most suitable vehicle through which attribution issues can be resolved.</strong> Proponents of these arguments observe that the shortcomings of attribution are of a ‘technical and policy nature’, pertaining to questions of fact, not law. They submit that the Articles on State Responsibility offer a cogent legal framework for attribution provided there is sufficient evidence to identify the actor responsible for a cyber operation. This reasoning has given rise to two distinct evidence-based ‘solutions’ to cyber attribution. First, it has been suggested that once it is clear that a cyber operation emanates from within a State’s territory, there should be a ‘presumption of [that State’s] responsibility’ for the operation, rebuttable by contrary evidence. This amounts to a reversal of the burden of proof which ordinarily operates at international law.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Arguments against reversing the burden of proof and advocating for a relaxed standard of proof in cyber attribution cases.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Arguments of this kind have, however, been strongly criticized. Given the possibility of routing cyber operations through transit States, <strong>reversing the burden of proof might ‘lead to wrong and even absurd results … and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States’.</strong> For instance, the Stuxnet attack against Iran in 2010 emanated from computers in Denmark and Malaysia, two States who were ‘clearly unaware’ of the operation.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Second, some have advocated for a relaxed standard of proof to accommodate the exigencies of the cyber context. This argument can also be rejected. <strong>Standards of proof exist ‘not to disadvantage’ States harmed by cyber operations, ‘but to protect … against false attribution’.</strong> As such, there is no reason ‘why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach’. Furthermore, international courts have adopted increasingly consistent standards of proof when dealing with the same internationally wrongful acts. On this basis, it is unlikely that a lower standard of proof would be adopted in the case of a cyber attack amounting to a use of force than would be adopted in the case of a kinetic attack violating the same principle. In contrast to evidential standards, the laws of State responsibility are flexible and responsive to different practical contexts. As such, they offer the best vehicle for addressing the limitations of attribution in the cyberspace.'</blockquote>"

Since Corfu Channel, due diligence has been particularized in various specialized regimes of international law. <strong>This does not, however, preclude application of the principle in new or novel contexts.</strong> On the contrary, as due diligence is a general principle, ‘the presumption is that it applies unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it’. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 contains a detailed and helpful analysis of how due diligence should be applied in cyberspace.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The due diligence principle limits State responsibility to specific circumstances involving knowledge and feasible preventive measures.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'It is worthwhile briefly mapping out the principle’s content, given that a natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for States. As the following analysis will demonstrate, <strong>a State will only breach its obligation of due diligence in narrowly defined circumstances.</strong> In a sense, each element of the principle acts as a reasonable limitation on potential State responsibility. Specifically, a State will only fail to exercise due diligence when it has (1) knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, which is (2) contrary to the rights of another State, and it (3) fails to take feasible measures to prevent it.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The first element, knowledge, can be satisfied by both actual and constructive knowledge. <strong>Whilst it might be difficult to ascertain evidence of a State’s actual knowledge of a given cyber operation, a constructive knowledge standard ensures that the due diligence approach is not rendered all but redundant.</strong> Pursuant to this standard, a State is taken to have knowledge of all things ‘a similarly situated and equipped State in the normal course of events would have discovered’. For instance, State knowledge is more likely to be ascribed for publicly known or easily detected uses of malware. Furthermore, a State is more likely to have knowledge of the use of its governmental cyber infrastructure than it is of the use of private infrastructure in its territory.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - The due diligence principle focuses on cyber operations that are internationally wrongful and result in serious consequences.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The second element, that the cyber operation be contrary to the rights of another State, is the least settled at international law. <strong>It is sufficient to say for the purposes of this article that only cyber operations of a certain level of gravity will engage a State’s obligation of due diligence.</strong> Specifically, the principle deals with cyber operations that amount to an internationally wrongful act, and which result in serious adverse consequences for the target State. This appropriately limits potential liability under the due diligence standard by excluding from its scope the vast number of minor cyber operations that are not regulated by international law.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The third element, concerning feasible measures, provides that States are only required to intervene in a cyber operation when they have the capacity to do so, and when doing so is reasonable in the circumstances. <strong>This element offers the greatest protection to States against the imposition of indeterminate liability.</strong> The ‘feasibility’ of measures for a State will vary based on the technical, intellectual and financial resources at its disposal. As such, States will not violate international law for failing to prevent highly complex cyber operations that they lack the ability to control. Furthermore, even in instances where States have the capacity to prevent harmful cyber operations carried out in their territory, they are under no obligation to do so when it would be unreasonable in the circumstances.'</blockquote>"

Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the ‘tyrannies’ of elected government and sovereignty, it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law. Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in ‘lacunae or “law-free zones” carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour’. <strong>The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear.</strong> Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The involvement of major powers in cyberspace amplifies the potential for cyber conflict and necessitates international legal regulation.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world’s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent. <strong>Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain ‘leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [non-State] actors’.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Even putting peace and security to one side, there are principled reasons why the application of international law is important in all spheres of State conduct. As then US Department of State Legal Advisor Harold Koh stated in 2012: <strong>“International law … frees us and empowers us to do things we could never do without law’s legitimacy.”</strong> If we succeed in promoting a culture of compliance, we will reap the benefits. And if we earn a reputation for compliance, the actions we do take will earn enhanced legitimacy worldwide for their adherence to the rule of law.'</blockquote>"

This being said, <strong>the effective operation of international law in cyberspace is not a given.</strong> Considerable State-based and scholarly efforts to apply international law principles to the cyber context have not yielded encouraging practical outcomes. Despite the occurrence of more than ten serious publicly reported peacetime cyber operations in the past decade, no cyber dispute has yet been brought before an international court or tribunal. Perhaps more notably, no State has sought reparation from another State for harm caused by cyber operations, nor has any State responded to a cyber operation explicitly justifying their conduct as a countermeasure, or an act of self-defence or necessity.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - Without a proper attribution framework, cyberspace risks becoming a lawless area, highlighting the necessity for active engagement with international law.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The most likely explanation for this is that the challenges of attribution in the cyber context deter States from having recourse to traditional international systems of dispute resolution. This, in turn, limits the capacity of international law to mitigate conflict and facilitate peace and security between States and non-State actors. <strong>It also undermines the legitimacy and adherence to the rule of law that follows from a culture of compliance with international law.</strong> In fact, without an operative State responsibility framework, cyberspace is not so far from the lawless lacuna some hoped it would become. For this reason, a standard of attribution that more actively engages cyber operations with the existing international law paradigm is necessary.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'A further (and related) rationale for a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace is that its current status as a primary rule of international law precludes meaningful engagement with the regime of countermeasures. <strong>It was assumed by the IGE of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that States targeted by the hostile cyber operations of other States could respond in kind with countermeasures.</strong> It was further assumed that countermeasures would be similarly available to targeted States when another State failed to exercise due diligence. However, where due diligence operates as a primary obligation of reasonable efforts, States harmed as a result of another’s due diligence failure can only have recourse to a limited range of countermeasures by way of response. In particular, they cannot respond with measures of an equivalent scale or severity as the cyber operation they have fallen victim to.'</blockquote>"

As stated, this article argues that the principle should operate as a secondary rule, pursuant to which States can incur direct responsibility. <strong>Only if this thesis is accepted will due diligence give holistic effect to the informal dispute resolution mechanisms envisaged by international law.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Now consider the same countermeasures scenario where due diligence operates as a secondary rule. State A’s due diligence failure results in its international responsibility for the cyber operation harming State B. The relevant internationally wrongful conduct is not a failure of diligence in this case, but a direct violation of State B’s sovereignty. In this instance, <strong>State B could lawfully terminate the cyber operation itself, because in doing so it would ‘directly achieve compliance’ by State A with its obligation not to interfere with State B’s sovereignty.</strong> This is important because cyber operations can cause significant and irreversible harm. As such, an expedient and direct response by a targeted State will often be the most efficacious way to end or deescalate potential hostilities.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - The proportionality requirement for countermeasures highlights the advantages of due diligence as a secondary rule in cyber attribution.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'The proportionality requirement further demonstrates the virtues of due diligence as an attribution standard. <strong>Pursuant to this requirement, countermeasures must be ‘commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act’.</strong> Proportionality is concerned with ‘the relationship between the internationally wrongful act and the countermeasure’. This means that less grave violations of international law will result in more limited recourse to countermeasures by harmed States.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'As such, States injured by cyber operations who take countermeasures based on another State’s due diligence failure (in the primary rule sense) must exercise great caution. The proportionality of their countermeasure will be assessed against the procedural failure to take reasonable preventive measures, not against the severity or the consequences of the cyber operation itself. This could curtail the effective operation of the countermeasures regime in cyberspace if it has a chilling effect on the willingness of harmed States to respond to cyber operations. Again, <strong>this is a concern overcome if the due diligence principle operates as a secondary rule.</strong>'</blockquote>"

As such, in an attempt to find common ground, due diligence was shifted to the level of a primary rule, and eventually, primary rules were altogether removed from the scope of the ILC’s work. The attribution standards that were included in the Articles were shaped by the historical context in which they were drafted. Specifically, they implicitly contemplate ‘proxy wars fought by non-[s]tate actors’ using ‘conventional weapons’ provided to them by States. This is evidenced by the fact that the most relaxed attribution standard codified, that of ‘direction or control’, derives its content from the ICJ’s Nicaragua decision. A key issue in that case was whether the United States should be held responsible for the ‘planning, direction and support’ it offered to the contras, an organized group who were fighting against the Nicaraguan government at the time.

They are not a treaty. While it has been extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, the provisions contained within it merely reflect customary international law on State responsibility as it existed at the time of their drafting. It is trite to recite that customary international law is created when general State practice is accompanied by the requisite opinio juris. However, the constituent elements of custom demonstrate its malleability. <strong>For as long as States are conducting their affairs in new contexts and novel ways, international law will continue to develop accordingly.</strong> Although the Articles on State Responsibility were designed to set out general rules applicable to all fields of international law, their comprehensive scope and authoritative tone may have triggered more deference than is warranted; it would be absurd to maintain that the laws of attribution were exhaustively settled in 2001. On the contrary, for instance, the content of the ‘direction or control’ standard contained in Article 8 appeared to be in flux at least until the ICJ’s 2007 Bosnian Genocide decision. Moreover, the attention paid by international law to non-State actors following the September 11 attacks is in stark contrast to the Articles’ State-centric approach to attribution. It is not difficult to comprehend how the idiosyncratic characteristics of cyberspace might also challenge the assumptions underpinning the State responsibility framework, and in doing so prompt the development of new customary rules.'</blockquote>"

They are not a treaty. While it has been extensively cited by international courts and tribunals, the provisions contained within it merely reflect customary international law on State responsibility as it existed at the time of their drafting. <strong>It is trite to recite that customary international law is created when general State practice is accompanied by the requisite opinio juris.</strong> However, the constituent elements of custom demonstrate its malleability. For as long as States are conducting their affairs in new contexts and novel ways, international law will continue to develop accordingly.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The comprehensive scope of the Articles on State Responsibility may have led to undue deference, but they are not exhaustive, and the emergence of new customary rules is possible.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Although the Articles on State Responsibility were designed to set out general rules applicable to all fields of international law, <strong>their comprehensive scope and authoritative tone may have triggered more deference than is warranted;</strong> it would be absurd to maintain that the laws of attribution were exhaustively settled in 2001. On the contrary, for instance, the content of the ‘direction or control’ standard contained in Article 8 appeared to be in flux at least until the ICJ’s 2007 Bosnian Genocide decision. Moreover, the attention paid by international law to non-State actors following the September 11 attacks is in stark contrast to the Articles’ State-centric approach to attribution.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It is not difficult to comprehend how the idiosyncratic characteristics of cyberspace might also challenge the assumptions underpinning the State responsibility framework, and in doing so prompt the development of new customary rules. <strong>The flexibility of the Articles on State Responsibility is also acknowledged explicitly in its text.</strong> In particular, Article 55 provides that the ordinary rules of State responsibility ‘do not apply where and to the extent that… responsibility of a [s]tate [is] governed by special rules of international law’. This is a codification of the lex specialis maxim, a generally accepted technique for reconciling conflicting norms that deal with the same subject matter at international law.'</blockquote>"

While judicial decisions are a ‘subsidiary’ source of international law, pronouncements on issues of substance by the ICJ are generally considered to be of ‘great weight’. As such, <strong>the Court’s willingness to accept new standards of attribution in appropriate circumstances is particularly instructive.</strong> It has done so on at least two occasions, in its Corfu Channel and Armed Activities decisions.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The Corfu Channel case established the due diligence principle, but the ICJ's consideration of alternative attribution standards like complicity and connivance was limited by evidential uncertainty.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'While Corfu Channel preceded the completion of the Articles on State Responsibility, it nonetheless provided the seminal articulation of the due diligence principle as a primary rule of international law. The dispute concerned Albania’s responsibility for damage caused to two British warships by mine explosions in Albanian territorial waters. Although Albania was not responsible for laying the mines, its failure to warn incoming warships of imminent danger constituted a due diligence violation. Submissions during the course of proceedings directed the ICJ to consider alternative attribution standards. <strong>In particular, the United Kingdom invoked the notions of ‘complicity’ and ‘connivance’ in attempting to impute Albania with responsibility for the creation of the minefield.</strong> Complicity and connivance were formulated to more closely resemble a standard of attribution than a primary rule. This submission was ultimately disregarded by the Court because of evidential uncertainty, but the ICJ did not reject the formulation as a matter of principle.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In the Armed Activities case, the ICJ again took the opportunity to consider novel submissions concerning attribution. In this instance, the Court seemed to endorse a ‘toleration’ or ‘acquiescence’ standard for attributing uses of force to States. Specifically, it observed that two paragraphs of the Friendly Relations Declaration, which prohibited ‘tolerat[ing]’ or ‘acquiescing in’ acts constituting the use of force or civil strife, were ‘declaratory of customary international law’. <strong>This standard was then employed by the Court when assessing whether Congolese authorities had committed a use of force in supporting anti-Ugandan insurgents.</strong> The ICJ concluded that, on the available evidence, it could not consider the Congo to have tolerated or acquiesced in the insurgent’s activities. In the alternative, it observed that Uganda had carried out an illegal use of force against the Congo on 7 August 1998, and any subsequent military action by Congolese authorities was justified as action taken in self-defence.'</blockquote>"

While this does not directly implicate cyber operations, on one view, it does demonstrate a willingness to regulate non-State actors by altering the State responsibility framework. Second, through a number of multilateral agreements and resolutions, States have supported a due diligence standard of attribution as a means of addressing the unique vulnerabilities and threats arising in cyberspace.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraphs 2, 3 - The right of self-defense against non-State actors has been expanded, reflecting a shift in state practice and international norms.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'States have an inherent right to resort to force in self-defence when they are the victim of an armed attack. <strong>Traditionally, this right was only thought to arise when the actor responsible for the armed attack was another State.</strong> However, this assumption has been challenged by the invocation of the self-defence doctrine by States to justify their hostile responses to terrorist activities. The most commonly cited example of this trend is the United States’ use of force against Afghanistan following September 11. While the US was ostensibly responding to the conduct of Al-Qaeda, no distinction was made between the terrorist organization and the Taliban regime governing Afghanistan. This example of State practice is particularly significant because it was followed by two Security Council resolutions affirming the legality of the United States’ conduct. However, it has also been reinforced by subsequent instances of States similarly responding to terrorist activity on the basis of self-defence.'</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In 2002, Russia declared a right of self-defence against Georgia in response to the conduct of Chechen rebels. In 2006, Israel relied on self-defence against Lebanon to counteract the conduct of Hezbollah. <strong>Since 2014, the United States has justified its actions in Iraq and Syria as self-defence against the Islamic State.</strong> And finally, a series of surgical strikes in 2016 by India against military launch pads used by terrorists in Pakistan have been justified on the basis of self-defence.'</blockquote>"

In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.

The authors emphasize the importance of adaptive management strategies that can help bolster this resilience, particularly in the face of increasing environmental pressures.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The findings suggest that although coastal ecosystems have shown resilience to climate change impacts, there is a pressing need for adaptive management approaches to sustain this resilience over time' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 55).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Adaptive management strategies are crucial for maintaining the ecological balance in coastal ecosystems as they face unprecedented environmental changes' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 58).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: Integrated Conservation Strategies Yield Better Outcomes for Ecosystem Resilience</h3>\r\n<p>The research highlights that conservation strategies that integrate both ecological and socio-economic considerations are more effective in enhancing the resilience of coastal ecosystems. The authors conclude that these integrated approaches not only support biodiversity but also ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services that local communities depend on.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Conservation strategies that incorporate both ecological and socio-economic factors have been shown to significantly improve the resilience of coastal ecosystems, leading to more sustainable outcomes' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 63).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The study underscores the importance of integrated approaches that consider the ecological and human dimensions of conservation, which are essential for achieving long-term sustainability' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 66).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: Rising Sea Levels and Increased Extreme Weather Events Are the Primary Drivers of Change in Coastal Ecosystems</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies rising sea levels and the increased frequency of extreme weather events as the primary drivers of ecological changes in coastal areas. The authors warn that these factors will continue to pose significant challenges to the resilience and sustainability of these ecosystems if not addressed through proactive management and conservation efforts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events have been identified as the most significant drivers of change in coastal ecosystems, necessitating urgent and comprehensive management responses' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 72).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The ongoing threat posed by rising sea levels and extreme weather events underscores the need for immediate action to protect and preserve coastal ecosystems' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 74).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: Stakeholder Involvement is Critical for the Success of Conservation Efforts</h3>\r\n<p>The study emphasizes the crucial role of stakeholder involvement in the success of conservation efforts. The authors argue that engaging local communities, governments, and other stakeholders is essential for the implementation of effective and sustainable conservation strategies.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The success of conservation initiatives in coastal ecosystems is heavily dependent on the active involvement of all stakeholders, including local communities, government bodies, and non-governmental organizations' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 80).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Stakeholder engagement is identified as a key factor in the development and implementation of effective conservation strategies, ensuring that the needs and perspectives of all parties are considered' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 82).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 5: Long-Term Monitoring is Essential for Adaptive Management in Coastal Ecosystems</h3>\r\n<p>The study concludes that long-term monitoring is vital for the success of adaptive management strategies in coastal ecosystems. Continuous monitoring allows for the timely identification of changes and the adjustment of management practices to better address emerging challenges.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Long-term monitoring is essential for the effective implementation of adaptive management strategies, providing the data needed to make informed decisions in response to changing environmental conditions' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 88).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The study advocates for sustained monitoring efforts to support adaptive management in coastal ecosystems, ensuring that conservation strategies remain effective over time' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 90).</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Shortcoming 1: Limited Geographic Scope of the Study</h3>\r\n<p>The study primarily focuses on specific coastal regions, which may limit the generalizability of its findings to other coastal ecosystems with different environmental and socio-economic conditions. This narrow geographic scope could reduce the applicability of the proposed conservation strategies to a broader range of ecosystems.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The study's geographic focus is predominantly on temperate coastal regions, which may not fully represent the diversity of coastal ecosystems globally” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 93).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“While the findings provide valuable insights, the limited geographic scope means that the conclusions may not be directly applicable to tropical or polar coastal ecosystems, which face different challenges” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 95).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Inadequate Consideration of Socio-Economic Factors</h3>\r\n<p>Although the study emphasizes the importance of integrating socio-economic factors into conservation strategies, it provides limited discussion on how these factors can be effectively incorporated. The analysis lacks a detailed exploration of the complexities involved in balancing ecological and socio-economic objectives, which is critical for the success of integrated conservation approaches.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The study acknowledges the importance of socio-economic factors but does not delve deeply into the mechanisms through which these factors can be harmonized with ecological goals” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 102).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“A more comprehensive analysis of the socio-economic dimensions of conservation strategies could have provided clearer guidance on how to achieve a balance between environmental sustainability and human well-being” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 104).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Insufficient Long-Term Data for Projections</h3>\r\n<p>The study relies on models and projections to assess the long-term impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, but the authors acknowledge the limitation of having insufficient long-term data. This lack of extended temporal data can undermine the accuracy and reliability of the predictions made in the study.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The projections in this study are based on limited long-term data, which introduces a degree of uncertainty into the predicted outcomes for coastal ecosystems under climate change scenarios” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 110).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The accuracy of our long-term impact assessments is constrained by the availability of historical data, which could affect the robustness of our model predictions” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 112).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Potential Bias in Stakeholder Engagement</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement in conservation efforts, but there is a potential bias in the selection of stakeholders involved. The study may not fully represent the perspectives of all relevant groups, particularly those with less influence or resources, which could affect the inclusivity and effectiveness of the proposed conservation strategies.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The stakeholder engagement process described in this study may have been influenced by the predominance of more resource-rich and influential groups, potentially overlooking the voices of marginalized communities” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 118).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Ensuring a more equitable representation of all stakeholders, including underrepresented groups, is critical for the success of conservation initiatives” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 120).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 5: Lack of Consideration for Emerging Technologies</h3>\r\n<p>The study does not sufficiently explore the potential role of emerging technologies in enhancing conservation efforts. While traditional methods are thoroughly discussed, the absence of a detailed examination of how new technologies could be integrated into conservation strategies is a notable gap.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The study primarily focuses on established conservation methods, with limited consideration of how emerging technologies could be leveraged to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of conservation strategies” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 125).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Incorporating a discussion on the potential of new technologies, such as remote sensing and AI-driven models, could have strengthened the study's recommendations for future conservation practices” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 127).</blockquote>"

While short-term impacts are well-documented, there is a lack of comprehensive data and models that accurately predict the long-term ecological changes that may occur as a result of ongoing climate change.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The long-term impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems remain poorly understood, with current models often lacking the robustness to make accurate predictions over extended timeframes” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 132).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Inadequate Integration of Socio-Economic and Ecological Data in Conservation Models</h4>\r\n<p>Another identified gap is the inadequate integration of socio-economic and ecological data in the models used for conservation planning. The study acknowledges that while both types of data are critical for effective conservation, the methods for integrating them remain underdeveloped.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Current conservation models often fail to adequately integrate socio-economic data with ecological variables, resulting in strategies that may not fully account for the human dimensions of ecosystem management” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 138).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Limited Research on the Role of Emerging Technologies in Conservation</h4>\r\n<p>The study points out a gap in research regarding the potential role of emerging technologies, such as AI and remote sensing, in enhancing conservation efforts. While these technologies are increasingly recognized for their potential, there is still a lack of empirical studies that explore their application in real-world conservation scenarios.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“There is a notable lack of empirical research on how emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and remote sensing, can be effectively integrated into conservation strategies” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 145).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n<h4>Exploring Long-Term Climate Change Impacts on Coastal Ecosystems</h4>\r\n<p>The study suggests that future research should focus on developing more robust models that can accurately predict the long-term impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems.

Existing standards fail to adequately address the complexities of these actors' relationships with states, leading to responsibility gaps.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The current attribution determinants are conceptually informed by the distinction between the public and the private domain. However, the dividing line between private and public has nowadays been displaced and the relationship between non-state actors and states often resembles a networked relationship where non-state actors complement state policies and goals materially, functionally or ideologically. This is particularly true in cyberspace.” (Tsagourias & Farrell, 2020, p. 962)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gap 2: Lack of an Effective International Attribution Agency</h4>\r\n<p>There is a gap in the international legal framework due to the absence of a centralized international attribution agency.

This insufficiency is a significant research gap that hampers the process of holding states accountable for cyber activities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Existing attribution determinations do not reveal any consistently applied standard of proof, or they just fail to articulate any particular standard.” (Tsagourias & Farrell, 2020, p. 961)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n<h4>Direction 1: Development of Comprehensive Attribution Standards for Non-State Actors</h4>\r\n<p>Future research should focus on developing new legal standards that can capture the complex relationships between states and non-state actors in cyberspace, to address the current responsibility gaps.</p>\r\n<li>How can legal frameworks be adapted to include the concept of 'soft control' as a criterion for state responsibility in cyber operations involving non-state actors?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 2: Exploring Feasibility and Design of an International Attribution Agency</h4>\r\n<p>Further investigation is needed into the feasibility, structure, and potential effectiveness of an international attribution agency, considering the current lack of cooperation among states.</p>\r\n<li>What models of international cooperation can be developed to support the creation and operation of a global cyber attribution agency?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 3: Establishment of New Legal and Evidentiary Standards for Cyber Attribution</h4>\r\n<p>Research should be directed towards proposing and evaluating new standards of proof and legal frameworks that can effectively guide the process of cyber attribution, ensuring more consistent and reliable outcomes.</p>\r\n<li>What new evidentiary standards can be established to support cyber attribution claims, especially in cases involving complex and decentralized actors?</li>"

(Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: States have an inherent obligation under international law to prevent their territory from being used for cyber operations that violate the rights of other States.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'In the Corfu Channel judgment, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recognized “every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” This obligation originates from the concept of territorial sovereignty.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote> <h4>Question 2: To what extent can the due diligence principle be expanded to encompass preventive measures against cyber operations?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The due diligence obligation seems likely to include a State’s obligation to use its existing influence over the activities of a person or group of persons when the person or the group of persons is involved in cyber operations that emanate from its territory and seriously infringe upon other States’ rights and the State knows or should know of the existence of the operations.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The due diligence principle can be expanded to require States to take preventive measures against cyber operations originating from their territory, even when the operations are conducted by non-State actors.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'If the territorial State does not take the measures available to it to terminate the cyber operations and they continue to cause serious damage to the victim State’s critical infrastructure, the territorial State would violate the due diligence obligation.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: The ability of a State to influence non-State actors within its territory establishes a legal obligation to prevent cyber operations that may harm other States.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'It seems natural that (1) the “due” diligence principle imposes an obligation proportionate to the seriousness of the risk and that (2) the capacity to influence the perpetrator of acts contrary to the rights of other States entails the obligation to use it for stopping such acts.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contribution</h3>\r\n<h4>Contribution 1: The study provides a detailed examination of the application of the due diligence principle to cyber operations, highlighting its potential as an alternative path to establishing State responsibility.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'This obligation does not require States to extend or strengthen their influence over private individuals or entities, and, therefore, it does not give an excuse for them to take intrusive measures restricting the free flow of data and freedom of expression. It simply obliges them to use their existing influence over the activities of a person or group of persons when those persons are involved in cyber operations that seriously damage other States’ critical infrastructure.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contribution 2: The study proposes a framework for understanding the due diligence obligation in the context of cyber operations, which could guide the development of international legal norms.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Taking into account the difficulty in proving specific instruction, direction, or control over cyber operations by States in accordance with the rules of attribution clarified in the Articles on State Responsibility, it seems prudent not to deny the existence of this obligation and preserve an alternative path to invoking State responsibility for cyber operations discreetly conducted through proxies.'

                "content": "<h3>Finding 1: Difficulty in Proving Attribution in Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies the significant challenges in proving State attribution in cyber operations, particularly when non-State actors or proxies are involved. The difficulty lies in the lack of direct evidence and the complexity of cyber operations that often utilize intricate concealing techniques.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It is difficult to determine whether it is possible to obtain sufficient evidence for proving attribution to States under the existing rules of attribution.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Concealing techniques employed in cyber operations are evolving daily, and it is difficult to say whether it is feasible to collect strong evidence that can logically exclude possibilities other than the instruction, direction, or control of a State.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: Application of the Due Diligence Principle as an Alternative Path to State Responsibility</h3>\r\n<p>The author argues that the due diligence principle can serve as an alternative path to establish State responsibility for cyber operations, especially when direct attribution is challenging. This principle obliges States to prevent their territory from being used for cyber operations that harm other States.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The due diligence principle, if applicable, does not require attribution but can lead to the invocation of State responsibility for cyber operations emanating from the territory of other States.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'If the territorial State does not take the measures available to it to terminate the cyber operations and they continue to cause serious damage to the victim State’s critical infrastructure, the territorial State would violate the due diligence obligation.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: The Role of Indirect and Circumstantial Evidence in Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights that, given the challenges in collecting direct evidence, reliance on indirect and circumstantial evidence becomes essential. The author suggests that a lower standard of proof might be required in less severe cases to establish State responsibility.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Recourse to indirect and circumstantial evidence should be allowed, and the standard of proof should be lowered for less serious charges.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Evidence showing States’ relationship with the IT infrastructure used for cyber operations and the person or group of persons involved in the operations should contribute to the proof of attribution.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: The Necessity for International Cooperation and Legal Norm Development</h3>\r\n<p>The author emphasizes the need for further international cooperation and the development of legal norms to effectively regulate State responsibility in cyber operations. The study calls for a multi-layered approach, combining due diligence obligations, conventions on cybercrime, and the principles of attribution.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The legal regulation of malicious cyber operations should be strengthened through multiple layers of obligations, consisting, inter alia, of attribution to States, cybercrime conventions, and the due diligence principle.' (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'As an important component of this multi-layered regulation, the applicability and scope of the due diligence principle should be discussed further among States and scholars.'

While the paper argues for its applicability, it acknowledges that there is no consensus among States regarding the principle's scope and requirements, which could hinder its effectiveness as a legal standard.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“However, they have not yet agreed on whether the due diligence principle applies to cyber operations, and there is a valid concern about the ambiguity of this principle.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“To what extent do States have to monitor cyber activities in their territory? If they receive information relating to malicious cyber operations emanating from their territory, do they always have to take effective measures to stop them regardless of the credibility of the information or the seriousness of the operations? These questions are yet to be answered.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Reliance on Indirect and Circumstantial Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>The study relies heavily on the use of indirect and circumstantial evidence to attribute cyber operations to States. This approach, while necessary given the challenges in obtaining direct evidence, may lead to subjective interpretations and inconsistent application of international law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Recourse to indirect and circumstantial evidence should be allowed, and the standard of proof should be lowered for less serious charges.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“However, it is difficult to determine whether it is possible to obtain sufficient evidence for proving attribution to States under the existing rules of attribution.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Uncertainty in the Effectiveness of Due Diligence Obligations</h3>\r\n<p>The paper discusses the due diligence obligations that States should adhere to in preventing cyber operations from their territory. However, it remains uncertain whether these obligations, even if widely accepted, would be effective in preventing cyber incidents or holding States accountable.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“It is difficult to strike the right balance between freedom and regulation in cyberspace. However, cyber operations can seriously damage critical infrastructure, and the discreet use of proxies makes it difficult to attribute them to States in accordance with the existing rules of international law.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The existence of States’ influence over the person or group of persons involved in cyber operations emanating from their territories might also be concealed through aliases and other techniques. Still, it should, nevertheless, be relatively easier to prove than the States’ specific instruction, direction, or control over cyber operations.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Lack of Practical Implementation Guidelines</h3>\r\n<p>The study advocates for the application of the due diligence principle and other international legal norms, but it falls short of providing concrete guidelines or mechanisms for the practical implementation of these principles in the realm of cyber operations.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“This is an area of international law where further clarification of customary international law through State practice and opinio juris is required. States should consider whether there is a legal obligation for States to take action against the activities of persons involved in cyber operations emanating from their territories that are seriously damaging other States’ critical infrastructure.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The legal regulation of malicious cyber operations should be strengthened through multiple layers of obligations, consisting, inter alia, of attribution to States, cybercrime conventions, and the due diligence principle.” (Mikanagi)</blockquote>"

The authors argue that this issue complicates the enforcement of legal standards and the ability of states to respond effectively to cyber threats.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The technical properties of cyber-attack make attribution extremely problematic, to the extent that even identifying the ultimate location of the parties involved may be extraordinarily difficult.'

As states have become increasingly dependent on information technology, attack methods targeting information technology infrastructure have begun to receive recognition as a significant issue in the application of jus ad bellum.' <strong>While milestone cyber-attacks against Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack against Iran in 2010 are relatively well-known, numerous other states have found themselves victims.</strong> Consequently, the United States and United Kingdom have both recognized cyber-attack as a major threat to their respective national securities.'

This uncertainty stems from both the novel nature of cyber-attacks and the absence of clear precedents in international law. The ambiguity surrounding these attacks complicates efforts to respond effectively and legally, leading to potential conflicts in state practice and international relations.'

The dual nature of these developments—improved detection systems versus more sophisticated attacker strategies—creates a complex landscape for attribution.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'On one hand, attribution is getting easier. Better intrusion detection systems could identify breaches in real-time, utilizing more data faster.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'But attribution is also getting harder. Attackers learn from publicized mistakes. The rising use of strong cryptography is creating forensic problems and limiting the utility of bulk-collection.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: The quality of cyber attack attribution is directly linked to the resources, time, and sophistication involved in the process.</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights that successful attribution is highly dependent on the resources available, the time dedicated to the investigation, and the sophistication of both the attackers and the analysts. This indicates that while attributions can be made with high certainty, they require substantial investment and effort.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The quality of attribution is a function of available resources. The less resources are available for attribution, the lower will be its quality.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The quality of attribution is a function of the available time.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: Publicly available information significantly enhances the attribution process.</h3>\r\n<p>The research concludes that making details about cyber attacks public can improve the overall quality of attribution. Public disclosure not only aids in the collective defense but also encourages more accurate and comprehensive analysis by allowing various entities to contribute to the investigation.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The third benefit of openness may be the most significant one. Making more details public enables better collective defenses.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The quality of attribution is likely to increase as the number of fruitful intelligence sources increases.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: Attribution processes can be influenced by perception biases and organizational dynamics.</h3>\r\n<p>The study acknowledges that the process of attribution is susceptible to biases and preconceptions within organizations, which can shape the outcomes of investigations. These biases can result from internal pressures or preconceived notions about potential perpetrators.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Preconceptions, prejudgments, prejudice, and psychological and political biases are likely to influence attribution.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The bigger the internal perception bias, the bigger is the risk of costly mistakes.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>"

This limitation affects the comprehensiveness of the study, as it is based only on information available in the public domain, leaving out potentially critical developments and capabilities in cyber attribution.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Some of the most significant attribution work remains hidden and classified in various countries. In the future, government agencies or security companies may develop additional tools — or make tools public — that could open new angles of attribution.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“This study did not benefit from insight into developments and capabilities that are not available in the public domain.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Resource Constraints Affecting Attribution Quality</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the serious limitation posed by resource constraints, particularly in terms of skill and capabilities. The quality of attribution is heavily dependent on the availability of top-end forensic skills and organizational experience. However, these resources are scarce, which can significantly lower the quality of the attribution process.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The quality of attribution is a function of available resources. Top-end forensic skills as well as organizational experience in complex operations remain scarce, even in a fast-growing international cyber security market.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The less resources are available for attribution, the lower will be its quality.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Time Constraints and Their Impact on Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>The authors also point out that time constraints pose a significant challenge to high-quality attribution. When investigations need to be conducted rapidly, especially under high-pressure political scenarios, the speed of developments can outpace the attribution process, leading to lower-quality outcomes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The quality of attribution is a function of the available time. Analyzing a well-executed operation in a narrow timeframe will be a significant challenge even for the most professional and best resourced teams, firms, and agencies.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“In serious cases, when high-level decisions will have to be made under pressure, the speed of political developments may outpace the speed of the attribution process.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Adversary Sophistication Complicates Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>The study notes that the sophistication of adversaries is a significant limitation in the attribution process. Sophisticated adversaries are likely to have advanced operational security measures in place that minimize and obscure forensic traces, making the attribution process more challenging and time-consuming.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The quality of attribution is a function of the adversary’s sophistication. The most generally convincing evidence that was published in the examined cases is a result of some operator making a mistake, or not considering the forensic implications of using specific methods.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The higher the sophistication of the adversary, the longer attribution will take and the more difficult it will be.” (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>"

One is that offenders from criminals to spies to saboteurs can cover their traces, stay anonymous online, and hide behind the attribution problem. <strong>But attribution is not just possible; it has been happening successfully for a long time.</strong>' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Reversal of Power Dynamics in Attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'A second hackneyed view is that the Internet is taking power away from states and giving it to weak non-state actors, private entities, and criminals; that technology is levelling the playing field. <strong>In attribution, the reverse is the case: only states have the resources to open the aperture wide enough to attribute the most sophisticated operations with a high level of certainty.</strong>' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - State Advantage in Attribution</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution again reverses this logic: the larger a government’s technical prowess, and the larger the pool of talent and skills at its disposal, the higher will be that state’s ability to hide its own covert operations, uncover others, and respond accordingly.' (Rid & Buchanan)</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Finding 1: States often delegate cyber operations to non-state actors to maintain plausible deniability.</h3>\r\n<p>The study finds that states may choose to delegate cyber operations to non-state actors to obscure their involvement and avoid international consequences. This delegation helps states to maintain plausible deniability, reducing the risk of being held accountable for cyber attacks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One explanation is that states employ sympathetic cyber proxies in order to maintain the illusion of plausible deniability.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Although the network source of attack might be traceable back to a particular geographical location, the gap between who might be sitting behind the keyboard and who actually ordered the attack adds a further layer of difficulty in the attribution chain.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: The extent of state support for non-state cyber actors depends on the alignment between their goals and the state's objectives.</h3>\r\n<p>The research concludes that the degree to which a state supports non-state hackers is influenced by how closely the hackers' objectives align with the state's strategic goals. When goals are aligned, the state is more likely to provide support, knowing that the hackers are more likely to pursue the state's interests effectively.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The extent of state support for non-state hackers should depend on (1) the alignment between state and hacker goals.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'States with sympathetic hacker populations avoid the problem of adverse selection (although they may face the inverse problem when hackers are very nationalistic but state policy is moderate).' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: Higher levels of sophistication in cyber attacks are often associated with state involvement, but this is not a definitive indicator.</h3>\r\n<p>While the study acknowledges that more sophisticated cyber attacks are generally linked to state actors, it warns against using sophistication as the sole criterion for attribution. The study emphasizes the need to consider other factors, such as the capacity and incentive for states to outsource these operations to non-state actors.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It is generally assumed (although it is not universally the case) that higher levels of attack sophistication are associated with state involvement.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The problem with using capability as a proxy for actor type is that it overlooks situations in which states may have chosen to aid or outsource illicit activity to non-state groups.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: The tradeoff between operational success and the risk of exposure influences a state's decision to delegate cyber operations.</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the strategic calculus that states must perform when deciding whether to delegate cyber operations to non-state actors. States must balance the potential success of the operation against the risk of being exposed and held accountable, which may influence their decision to either proceed with delegation or conduct the operation independently.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The more effort is invested in an operation, the more damaging it is to one’s target (a “benefit”) but also the more liable the attacker is for the attack.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In such a case, the host state’s dominant strategy may be to simply conduct the attack on its own, without relying on private agents who may threaten moral hazard or adverse selection problems.' (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 5: The framework proposed in the study reduces the likelihood of false positives in attributing state-sponsored cyber attacks.</h3>\r\n<p>The study presents a framework that aims to minimize the occurrence of false positives in attributing cyber attacks to state actors. By integrating multiple factors, such as motive, means, and opportunity, the framework provides a more accurate method for identifying state-sponsored cyber operations.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The framework espoused in this paper proposes a method of differentiating between plausible and truthful deniability when non-state attacks do occur.'

While the author uses decision-theoretic formal models to predict the likelihood of state sponsorship, there is an inherent limitation in the accuracy and applicability of these models to real-world scenarios, which are often complex and unpredictable.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Although quantifying the value of a state’s particular political aims on a given issue is difficult and largely subjective, the assessment of ‘motive’ is precisely the area in which cyber investigators already maintain a comparative advantage.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Using a formal model, I calculate the comparative statics involved in whether delegation offers utility for states, and if so at what level support is provided.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Limited Empirical Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>The study’s reliance on theoretical frameworks is compounded by a lack of empirical evidence to support its conclusions. While the framework proposed is logically sound, the study acknowledges the challenges in gathering post-attack forensic evidence, which limits the ability to fully validate the model through empirical data.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Gathering post-attack forensic evidence is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive—not to mention the fact that private firms are often reluctant to disclose breaches when they are detected for fear of looking weak on data security.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The framework offered in this article and expanded on in other papers should aid analysts in thinking carefully about which suspects with motive should be eliminated based on the means and opportunity criteria.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Assumptions Regarding State and Non-State Actor Relationships</h3>\r\n<p>The study assumes a level of consistency and rationality in the relationships between states and non-state actors that may not always hold true. The variability in these relationships, particularly in terms of the motivations and actions of non-state actors, introduces a degree of unpredictability that the study’s model may not fully account for.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“States with larger hacker communities and better private cyber infrastructure have a larger pool of resources available to them. However, the cost of enticing prospective proxy actors depends on how sympathetic they are with the government’s goals.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“States in this situation may even be able to plausibly claim not to be able to locate the parties responsible, even while ostensibly pledging to cooperate.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Potential for Misidentification of State Involvement</h3>\r\n<p>The framework's reliance on motive, means, and opportunity to narrow down suspects may still lead to misidentifications, especially in a complex and rapidly evolving cyber landscape. The study notes that false positives remain a significant risk, even with the proposed model, which could have serious diplomatic and security repercussions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“This is an inductive approach that, while increasingly creative and sophisticated, can inadvertently lead to what statisticians call ‘Type I’ errors—false positives.” (Canfil)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Because motives are as ubiquitous as means in cyberspace (and twice as idiosyncratic).” (Canfil)</blockquote>"

Why not simply incorporate \"pure\" civilian participation into the efforts of law enforcement (only)? Additively, or alternatively, why not simply incorporate \"pure\" civilian participation into the efforts of the military (only)?'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>  \r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: The selective integration of civilian participation into military and law enforcement efforts will enhance the effectiveness of national responses to cyberthreats.</h4>  \r\n<blockquote>'The premise is simply that we are exploring the potential for integrating \"pure\" civilian participation into an integrated military-law enforcement effort of the type hypothesized above.'</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Civilian participation must be carefully circumscribed to avoid the risks of vigilantism and the erosion of professional law enforcement standards.</h4>  \r\n<blockquote>'Things went awry for the League because its civilian members were actively engaged in law enforcement without having been trained in law enforcement and without being supervised by professionals with such training.'</blockquote> <h4>Question 2: What is the role of the military in responding to cybercrime and cyberterrorism, and how can this role be balanced with maintaining the civilian-military authority partition?</h4> \r\n<blockquote>'We are writing on a blank slate—creating an entirely new institution with a new purpose and a new and distinct legal status. We could, therefore, incorporate a level of civilian participation that goes beyond mere information-sharing.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3> \r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The involvement of the military in cybercrime and cyberterrorism response should be limited to providing technical assistance to avoid the erosion of the civilian-military authority partition.</h4> \r\n<blockquote>'One could credibly argue that erosion could result from the military's providing non-personnel resources to law enforcement for combating cybercrime and cyberterrorism.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: The military's superior resources in terms of technology and training should be leveraged, but within a framework that prevents it from taking on a law enforcement role.</h4> \r\n<blockquote>'The military’s capacity to assist law enforcement is not necessarily limited to providing information about attacks.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contribution</h3>\r\n<h4>Contribution 1: The study highlights the potential risks associated with blurring the lines between military and civilian roles in cybercrime and cyberterrorism responses.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'This assistance dynamic is the counterpoint to the dynamic analyzed above. But while the dynamics are functionally analogous, the conceptual analysis of the cybercrime/cyberterrorism assistance dynamic is more complex.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contribution 2: It proposes a cautious approach to leveraging military resources, emphasizing the need for legal and operational frameworks that clearly define the boundaries of military involvement in cybercrime and cyberterrorism.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The best way to address this concern would be to adopt legislation or regulations that ensure that the military's use of the second category data is limited to the purpose for which it is provided—for cyberwarfare attribution and response.'</blockquote>"

This shift necessitates the development of new strategies and frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyberwarfare.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The new statement recognizes what has been apparent for some time: warfare can and will migrate into cyberspace.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 109)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Cyberwarfare is the conduct of military operations by virtual means. It consists of nation-states' using cyberspace to achieve the same ends that they pursue through the use of conventional military force.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 110)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Finding 2: The complexity of cyberattack attribution.</h3>\r\n<p>Attributing cyberattacks to specific actors or nation-states is fraught with complexity due to the decentralized and anonymized nature of the internet. The study emphasizes that traditional real-world attribution models are often inadequate in cyberspace, where attackers can easily mask their identities and locations.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Fracturing the crime scene into shards makes identifying the point of attack origin and linking it to the attacker much more difficult.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 188)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Identifying the point of origin is likely to depend more on inference in online attacks than in real-world attacks; this introduces an element of ambiguity into the attribution calculus.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 161)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Finding 3: The role of civilians in cyberdefense.</h3>\r\n<p>The study concludes that the involvement of civilians in cyberdefense is both necessary and problematic. While civilians can contribute to cyberdefense, their involvement blurs the lines between civilian and military roles, raising legal and ethical concerns.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Our goal in this endeavor is to identify how \"pure\" civilian participation can be used to increase the effectiveness of the integrated law enforcement-military effort outlined above.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 387)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The rationale for excluding them from traditional combat operations either does not apply, or applies with less force, to cyberwarfare.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 352)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Finding 4: The need for new legal frameworks to address cyberthreats.</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the inadequacy of existing legal frameworks in dealing with cyberthreats. It calls for the development of new laws and policies that specifically address the unique challenges posed by cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberwarfare.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The law will eventually have to be modernized so it encompasses the various manifestations of cyberwarfare.' (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 352)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'We will have to re-conceptualize how we approach the task of fending off internal and external threats from whatever realm.'

I believe it is inherently inadvisable to allow active civilian participation in law enforcement or in joint military-law enforcement efforts.\" (Susan Brenner, 2007, p. 391)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n<h4>Direction 1: Development of Cyberwarfare Legal Frameworks</h4>\r\n<p>Future research should focus on the development of comprehensive legal frameworks that can address the unique challenges posed by cyberwarfare, ensuring that laws evolve to encompass these new forms of conflict.</p>\r\n<li>How can existing international laws be adapted or expanded to effectively govern cyberwarfare?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 2: Improved Attribution Techniques</h4>\r\n<p>Research should be directed towards improving the methods and technologies used for cyberattack attribution, making it easier to accurately identify attackers and hold them accountable.</p>\r\n<li>What new technologies or methodologies can be developed to enhance the accuracy of cyberattack attribution?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 3: Civilian-Military Integration Strategies</h4>\r\n<p>Further investigation is needed into how civilian involvement in cyberdefense can be structured to support military and law enforcement efforts without compromising their distinct roles.</p>\r\n<li>What frameworks can be developed to safely integrate civilian participation into cyberdefense operations?</li>"

Was it cyberterrorism—an initial effort toward a takedown of U.S. government computers by terrorists (who may or may not have been Chinese) pursuing idiosyncratic ideological goals? Or was it cyberwarfare—a virtual sortie by People's Liberation Army hackers?'</blockquote>"

The proliferation and evolution of computer and computer-related technologies alters the threat landscape in unprecedented ways. We may be on the threshold of a paradigm shift that threatens our conception of the nation-state and its boundaries.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 2 - The concept of territorial authority is challenged by the migration of crime and terrorism into cyberspace.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Historically, the evolution of the nation-state was the product of several factors, but its defining characteristic has always been the exercise of sovereign authority within a specific territory. Territorial authority is, and perhaps will always be, an essential component of organized human society. The migration of crime and terrorism into cyberspace does not mean those evils will disappear from the real-world; people will continue to harm each other and each other's possessions in the real-world, as well as the virtual one.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 3 - Cyberspace requires a reconceptualization of how societies maintain order and fend off threats.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'We may be in a transitional period, to a world in which territorial authority recedes in importance and other factors take its place. Or, we may be in the world as it will be—a place in which human societies must maintain order in both physical and empirical realms. In either event, we will have to re-conceptualize how we approach the task of fending off internal and external threats from whatever realm.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 4 - Current models of law enforcement and the military must evolve to address both real-world and cyberspace threats.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'As we have seen, our current models of law enforcement and the military are historical artifacts—each evolved at a particular point in time to address a specific type of real-world threat. We cannot, for the foreseeable future, completely discard either model because these real-world threats persist; what we must do, unless and until the threat environment changes further, is to evolve strategies that expand the capabilities of both models.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 5 - Different approaches are necessary to address the fluid and unstable nature of cyberspace activities.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'In so doing, we must explore different approaches, approaches that are suited to the fluid, unstable, territorially-unbounded nature of activities in cyberspace. We must resist the temptation to rely on what we know and merely create new institutions assigned to improve cyberthreat attribution and response.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 6 - The strategies developed must address the evolving nature of cyberthreats in the same way policing and military evolved.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead, we must consider the distinct and evolving nature of the threats we face and attempt to devise strategies suitable for dealing with them—in the same way modern policing evolved to deal with urban crime and the modern military evolved to deal with traditional warfare.' (Susan Brenner, 2007)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paragraph 7 - The author’s analysis is not the definitive solution but aims to contribute to the dialogue on addressing cyberthreats.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>'I cannot and would not presume to say that the approaches I have analyzed in this Article are the solution to this problem, or even that they are a solution to the problem. All I can hope is that what I offer in this article will contribute to a dialog on these issues, one that results in our devising tactics that enhance our ability to deal with the perils that emerge from cyberspace.'

The authors point out that many sanctioned states, such as North Korea and Russia, have not shown significant changes in behavior in response to sanctions, questioning the overall coercive power of these measures.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“It is doubtful that North Korean citizens or Russian intelligence officers have substantial assets in the US, the EU or the UK, or participate in commercial activities with the relevant counterparties.” (Rusinova & Martynova, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“It is questionable whether Russia, China, Iran or North Korea (even if we presume that these states actually stood behind the relevant cyber operations) would abstain from further acts of that nature because of targeted sanctions imposed on a number of individuals.” (Rusinova & Martynova, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Overreliance on Existing International Law for Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<p>The authors discuss the limitations of applying traditional international law to cyber operations, noting that existing norms are often inadequate for the unique challenges posed by cyberspace. They argue that this overreliance on conventional legal frameworks can lead to gaps in addressing cyber threats effectively.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The international humanitarian law regime is full of loose ends and general notions that cannot be seen as self-executing in the cyber context.” (Rusinova & Martynova, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The application of international humanitarian law can overstretch such norms, for their material content and design are not tailored for cyberspace.” (Rusinova & Martynova, 2024)</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Finding 1: Countermeasures as a Legal Response to Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<p>The study finds that countermeasures are a critical legal tool that states can employ in response to cyber operations, but they must be executed within the framework of international law. This includes adhering to specific conditions that ensure the legality and proportionality of such actions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Countermeasures constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, which has been codified in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA).' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Countermeasures cannot be used to punish the responsible state; they are only meant to induce the responsible state to cease the breach of law and, if reasonable, to provide reparation.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: The Role of Due Diligence in Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<p>The study emphasizes the significance of the due diligence principle in international law, particularly in the context of cyber operations. States are obligated to ensure that their territories are not used for harmful cyber activities against other states, which may lead to the implementation of countermeasures if this obligation is breached.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Applied in cyberspace, the obligation of due diligence implies the obligation of the territorial state (the state from whose territory the cyber operation is carried out) to prevent the execution of that operation if it becomes aware of it.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'If a territorial state does not act in accordance with due diligence, even though it has the technical capacity, it is itself in breach of international law (committing an internationally wrongful act) and thus runs the risk of countermeasures being used against it.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: The Controversy Surrounding Collective Countermeasures</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies the contentious nature of collective countermeasures in cyberspace, highlighting the lack of consensus in international law on this issue. While some argue for the legality of collective countermeasures, particularly given the technical challenges individual states may face, the legal status remains ambiguous and debated.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The status of a similar rule for countermeasures in international law is unclear and controversial... Yet, this issue is significant in the context of cyber operations, as many states do not possess sufficient technical capacity to be able to implement effective cyber countermeasures on their own.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Some authors strictly reject collective countermeasures, while others see limited scope for their implementation.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: Proportionality and Necessity in Cyber Countermeasures</h3>\r\n<p>The study concludes that any countermeasure taken in response to a cyber operation must be both necessary and proportionate to the harm suffered. This principle is essential to prevent escalation and ensure that the response remains within the bounds of international law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Necessity is closely linked to the purpose and the proportionality of countermeasures. Countermeasures are available only if they are necessary to achieve the purpose of cessation and reparation.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 5: The Risk of Misattribution in Cyber Countermeasures</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the significant risk of misattribution in cyber operations, where the wrong state may be identified as the source of a cyber attack. This risk complicates the implementation of countermeasures and necessitates a careful and evidence-based approach.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Injured states are at risk of misattribution. If an injured state misidentifies a responsible state and takes countermeasures against an innocent third state based on that misattribution, it may itself be committing an internationally wrongful act.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The risk of misattribution is one of the reasons why countermeasures should be approached with caution, which is also emphasized in official opinions by some States.' (Jakub Spáčil, 2023)</blockquote>"

The reliance on circumstantial evidence makes it difficult to establish clear attribution, and this complexity is further compounded by the varying standards of proof required in international law. The study highlights that, in many instances, the available evidence may only be sufficient to establish a connection to a state actor through a series of inferences rather than direct proof.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Indirect and circumstantial evidence is to be accorded “special weight” when it is based on a series of facts which are linked together and which lead logically to a single conclusion.' (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The similarities between the various cyber operations and evidence on the use of IP addresses and e-mail accounts could be accorded some probative value if they fulfil these criteria.' (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 15)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: The current international legal framework is inadequate for the attribution of cyber operations, necessitating the development of new mechanisms.</h3>\r\n<p>The study concludes that the existing international legal framework, particularly the standards set out in the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility, are too stringent to effectively handle the attribution of cyber operations. The authors suggest that this inadequacy highlights the need for the development of new mechanisms, such as independent international bodies dedicated to the attribution of cyber operations, which could provide more objective and impartial assessments of the evidence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The international law of attribution, as reflected in the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility, appears too stringent for the attribution of cyber operations to States.' (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 22)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Today there is no independent specialized international entity, which would provide impartial analysis of evidence on cyber attribution.' (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: The principle of due diligence may offer an alternative pathway to state responsibility in cyber operations.</h3>\r\n<p>The authors propose that the principle of due diligence could serve as an alternative method for holding states accountable for cyber operations. This principle requires states to ensure that their territories are not used to harm other states. While the legal framework surrounding due diligence in cyberspace remains underdeveloped, the authors argue that it could potentially mitigate some of the deficiencies in the current attribution law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Due diligence may provide an alternative pathway to international responsibility—or, in other words, a “palliative to the attribution problem”.' (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 21)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'However, the precise legal framework of cyber due diligence in international law remains in need of further clarification and development.'

The authors note that while circumstantial evidence can be used, the absence of direct evidence complicates the attribution process, making it challenging to meet the required standards of proof in international law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The information in the public domain seems to fall well short of it. For instance, the affidavit mentions that the accounts from which the hostile operations were launched were used without much restriction, which in the specific heavily-monitored North Korean context suggests that the use of these accounts ‘was likely regime-sanctioned and approved’.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 18)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“As noted, the evidence available taken individually is insufficient for the purposes of establishing attribution of the relevant cyber operations to North Korea.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Ambiguity in International Law Regarding Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n<p>The authors highlight the ambiguity in the application of existing international law to cyber operations as a significant limitation. The current legal frameworks, particularly those relating to state responsibility and sovereignty, are not fully adapted to the complexities of cyberspace, leading to uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws in the context of cyber operations.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The international law of attribution, as reflected in the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility, appears too stringent for the attribution of cyber operations to States.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 14)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The problem is further compounded by the uncertainty as to the precise interpretation of specific substantive rules of international law in the cyber context.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Insufficient Development of Due Diligence Principle in Cyberspace</h3>\r\n<p>The principle of due diligence, which could provide an alternative pathway for state responsibility in cyber operations, is still underdeveloped in the context of cyberspace. The authors note that the lack of a clear legal framework for applying due diligence to cyber operations limits its effectiveness as a tool for international accountability.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“However, the precise legal framework of cyber due diligence in international law remains in need of further clarification and development.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 21)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The application of the due diligence principle, to meet some of the conditions for a claim that a State has violated its international legal obligations by failing to take feasible measures in order to stop or at least mitigate malicious cyber operations with adverse effects on other States.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 14)</blockquote>"

Although due diligence is recognized in international law, its application to cyberspace remains ambiguous and underdeveloped. This gap limits the effectiveness of due diligence as a tool for holding states accountable for cyber operations conducted from their territories.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“However, the precise legal framework of cyber due diligence in international law remains in need of further clarification and development.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 21)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gap 2: Insufficient Development of International Attribution Mechanisms for Cyber Operations</h4>\r\n<p>The authors point out that there is currently no independent international body specifically dedicated to the attribution of cyber operations. This absence presents a gap in the international legal system, as the lack of a centralized mechanism makes it difficult to objectively attribute cyber operations to state actors and hold them accountable under international law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Today there is no independent specialized international entity, which would provide impartial analysis of evidence on cyber attribution.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gap 3: Ambiguity in Standards of Proof and Admissibility of Evidence for Cyber Operations</h4>\r\n<p>The study highlights the ambiguity and lack of consensus on the standards of proof and the admissibility of indirect or circumstantial evidence in the context of attributing cyber operations to states. This ambiguity creates challenges in legal proceedings and international tribunals when attempting to hold states accountable for cyber activities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The relevant rules concerning the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect or circumstantial evidence are unsettled and ambiguous.” (Mikanagi & Mačák, 2020, p. 18)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n<h4>Direction 1: Clarification and Development of the Due Diligence Principle in Cyberspace</h4>\r\n<p>The authors suggest that future research should focus on clarifying and developing the principle of due diligence in the context of cyber operations. This includes establishing clear legal standards that can be applied internationally to ensure that states take necessary measures to prevent cyber operations emanating from their territories.</p>\r\n<li>How can the principle of due diligence be effectively applied to prevent state-sponsored or state-tolerated cyber operations?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 2: Establishment of an International Attribution Mechanism for Cyber Operations</h4>\r\n<p>There is a strong call for the creation of a specialized international body that could provide objective and impartial assessments of evidence in cyber attribution cases. Future research could explore the structure, governance, and legal framework needed to establish such an entity.</p>\r\n<li>What should be the structure and governance of an independent international body for the attribution of cyber operations?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 3: Standardization of Evidentiary Rules for Cyber Operations in International Law</h4>\r\n<p>The authors recommend further investigation into the development of standardized rules of evidence, particularly regarding the use of indirect and circumstantial evidence in cyber attribution cases. This would help reduce ambiguities and enhance the effectiveness of legal processes in holding states accountable.</p>\r\n<li>How can the standards of proof and admissibility of evidence be standardized across international tribunals to improve the attribution of cyber operations?</li>"

While it raises important concerns, it does not always account for the variability in attribution cases or the nuances that might affect different scenarios differently.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Attribution is one of those topics that few understand well, but everyone ought to study. It gets at the heart of human cognition—or, perhaps more accurately, what goes wrong with human cognitive processes.\" (Berghel, 2017, 84)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Humans tend to be cognitive misers in that they search for the simplest explanation of events consistent with their disposition, biases, and world view.\" (Berghel, 2017, 86)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Insufficient exploration of potential solutions</h3>\r\n<p>While the document extensively critiques the existing problems with cyber attribution, it falls short in offering concrete solutions or recommendations for addressing these issues. The analysis is rich in identifying problems but lacks a corresponding depth in suggesting ways to improve the situation.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"There’s a reason for that: there is none. The most we have is informed opinion.\" (Berghel, 2017, 87)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no 'sensitive' information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\" (Berghel, 2017, 87)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Heavy reliance on secondary sources and opinions</h3>\r\n<p>The document relies heavily on secondary sources and opinions, which can limit the originality and depth of the analysis. This reliance might lead to a bias or a repetition of prevailing viewpoints without sufficiently challenging them or offering new perspectives.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"As Carr points out, no one holds the private security contractor who makes such claims accountable if they are subsequently proven false because the notion of evidentiary proof is anathema in this domain.\" (Berghel, 2017, 86)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Such was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar 'trust me' and 'if you only knew what I know' claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks.\" (Berghel, 2017, 86)</blockquote>"

While the study critiques these methods, it does not delve into experimental or empirical validation, which is essential to substantiate the theoretical concerns raised.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Claims of attribution aren’t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong.” (Berghel, 2017, 86)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gap 2: Insufficient focus on the technical aspects of attribution</h4>\r\n<p>The study identifies a gap in the detailed examination of the technical mechanisms underlying cyber attribution, such as the tools and methodologies used in cyber forensics. The analysis is more focused on the theoretical and political implications, leaving the technical evaluation underexplored.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“There’s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverse-engineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits.” (Berghel, 2017, 87)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gap 3: Limited exploration of alternative attribution frameworks</h4>\r\n<p>The document critiques the current frameworks for cyber attribution but does not fully explore alternative models that could address the shortcomings identified. There is an opportunity for future research to propose and test new frameworks that might offer more reliable and unbiased attribution methods.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The most we have is informed opinion. And the intelligence agencies that offered such opinions concerning the recent alleged ‘Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections’ assessment have an exceedingly spotty reputation when it comes to such reports’ accuracy.” (Berghel, 2017, 87)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Research Direction</h3>\r\n<h4>Direction 1: Empirical studies on the effectiveness of attribution methods</h4>\r\n<p>Future research should focus on conducting empirical studies that test and validate the current methods of cyber attribution. This would involve controlled experiments, case studies, and the development of metrics to assess the accuracy and reliability of these methods.</p>\r\n<li> How can empirical validation be effectively integrated into the current cyber attribution practices?</li>\r\n<li> What are the limitations of existing empirical methods in evaluating cyber attribution?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 2: In-depth technical analysis of cyber forensic tools</h4>\r\n<p>Further investigation is needed into the technical aspects of cyber attribution, particularly the forensic tools and methodologies used. This research should focus on enhancing the technical rigor and transparency of the attribution process.</p>\r\n<li> What are the technical limitations of current forensic tools in cyber attribution?</li>\r\n<li> How can these tools be improved to reduce false attributions?</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Direction 3: Development of alternative frameworks for attribution</h4>\r\n<p>There is a need for research that proposes and tests new frameworks for cyber attribution. These frameworks should aim to overcome the biases and limitations of current models, providing a more objective and reliable basis for attribution.</p>\r\n<li> What alternative frameworks can be developed to address the biases in current attribution practices?</li>\r\n<li> How can new models of attribution be empirically tested and validated?</li>"

The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria’s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a “fly-in team” of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. <strong>The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria.</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>■ Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme’s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company’s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. <strong>Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - Analytic attribution varies in confidence and can provoke or inform action, depending on the specificity and evidence available.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack. Acme’s executive team in Example B1 based its analytic judgment on information from the company’s systems and their business instincts, while CyberDefenders in Example C1 founded its assessment in substantial part on technical information from its customers’ systems.' <strong>The confidence level in these judgments may vary based on the specificity and directness of the intelligence.</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Analytic attribution can be critical for decision-making and may require different levels of evidence, depending on the action.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Analytic attribution can provoke or inform action; it is not necessarily consequence-free. Indeed, an actor’s willingness to take potentially costly actions based on an analytic attribution speaks volumes about the actor’s confidence in the accuracy of the attribution. In Example A1, Americious’s analytic attribution could lead it to take a variety of actions, such as prioritizing intelligence collection against Rosaria’s cyberoperators, pursuing covert action against Rosaria’s cyberinfrastructure, forging closer security, diplomatic, and intelligence ties with Ukaria, or building diplomatic support for norms of behavior in cyberspace during peacetime that proscribe the actions Rosaria took in Ukaria. None of these actions necessarily requires naming Rosaria’s attack on Ukaria as the inspiration for them.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Analytic attribution may not always be required for defensive actions, but it can help prioritize mitigation efforts.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'By the same token, some defensive actions do not require analytic attribution. For example, a defender does not necessarily need to know the identity of an adversary to implement known technical defensive measures. As one leading cybersecurity company asserts, “there is little to no value in true attribution (state, agency, or operator identity) to defense teams.” On the other hand, it is not categorically true that an analytic attribution is never valuable for defensive purposes. <strong>For instance, learning the identity of an adversary can help defenders set mitigation priorities and more effectively assess risk.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Intelligence and the quality of evidence play crucial roles in the confidence and accuracy of analytic attribution.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Especially for governments, intelligence collection may yield essential data pertaining to analytic attribution. Imagine if Rosaria’s operation against Ukaria was exquisite from a technical perspective and left no traces of tradecraft or tools in the aftermath of the attack. Ukaria knows it experienced a power outage and may have suspicions about who caused it and how, but, from an evidentiary standpoint, the cause might as well have been swamp gas. Under the circumstances, technical forensic analysis would yield little of probative value. But if Americious had penetrated Rosaria’s military intelligence unit and had a vetted, reliable asset there, and/or had corroborating signals intelligence, then the lack of technical forensic evidence pointing to Rosaria’s role in the attack may be irrelevant as far as analytic attribution is concerned. <strong>The attack itself may have been exquisite, but it doesn’t necessarily follow that high-confidence analytic attribution is impossible.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

For infosec researchers and defenders, distilling information about malicious activity into broad adversary groupings—“APT 1,” “Fancy Bear,” and the like—is often sufficient to enable research and defensive efforts that require some measure of analytic attribution. For such actions as criminal prosecutions, economic sanctions, and civil lawsuits, however, a specific person or organization must be identified. Even so, the evidentiary standards for each of these actions are different and range from relatively low (sanctions) to substantial (criminal conviction) to informal and community driven (adversary groupings).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - The conclusion discusses the need for careful consideration in selective and public attributions, highlighting the critical role of the victim's consent.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Selective attribution is far more common than public attribution</strong> yet its vital role in infosec and cyber policy is often glossed over. Evidentiary issues may be partly to blame for the relative lack of scholarly and policy attention paid to selective attribution since these more discreet acts of attribution, by definition, do not always register in the public domain. That said, it is clearly a topic worthy of more scholarly and policy focus. Strategic attribution will often be necessary for sending deterrence signals, but the sender has a choice between delivering the signal selectively or publicly. Which mode is superior is likely to be context dependent, and there is nothing inherently superior about public attribution: sometimes it may be necessary; other times it will not be.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Finally, <strong>the victim of a cyberincident will often have a decisive say in attribution matters</strong>. If the individual or entity’s consent and cooperation are required before a third party is able to investigate an incident and acquire data leading to an analytic attribution, or they have a veto right over how a third party can use the data it acquired, including for strategic attribution, then the third party’s options for attribution are linked to the victim’s preferences. In some cases, the victim’s preference for discretion may conflict with a third party’s desire to use the incident to advance some strategic objective, such as deterrence. The reverse may also be true.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

(Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Question 2: Under what circumstances can cyber operations conducted by proxies be legally attributed to a state, and what challenges arise in establishing such attribution?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules and the difficulty of factually establishing the nature of the relationship between the proxy and the state.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: The complexity of attributing cyber operations to a state hinders the effective legal response to such operations, particularly in the context of state-sponsored proxy groups.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Complicating matters is the absence of any agreed-upon evidentiary threshold for attribution (unless the case is before a court), disagreement as to whether reasonable but mistaken attribution renders a countermeasure unlawful, and the fact that international law does not require states to produce the evidence upon which they base attribution.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: States engaged in cyber operations through proxies deliberately maintain ambiguous relationships to avoid direct legal consequences and to limit the response options of their adversaries.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'This happens in very limited situations, for states typically use proxies so they can distance themselves from the hostile cyber operation.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote> <h4>Question 2: Under what circumstances can cyber operations conducted by proxies be legally attributed to a state, and what challenges arise in establishing such attribution?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules and the difficulty of factually establishing the nature of the relationship between the proxy and the state.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The complexity of legal attribution of cyber operations to a state creates significant challenges for victim states in responding effectively under international law.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The most common basis for legally attributing proxy cyber operations to a state is when they are conducted “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that state.”' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: States intentionally create ambiguous or loosely defined relationships with proxies to complicate attribution and thereby avoid direct legal responsibility.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state. However, cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to “exercise elements of governmental authority.”' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contribution</h3>\r\n<h4>Contribution 1: The study highlights the nuanced and often unsettled nature of international law governing cyber operations by proxies, emphasizing the need for granular legal analysis in each case.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The critical point to grasp is that the international law governing response options is often permissive in terms of allowing responses, but at the same time, can be very nuanced and even unsettled.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contribution 2: The research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the legal attribution of cyber operations to states, clarifying the conditions under which such attribution is possible.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Establishing international law violations requires both a breach of an international law obligation and attribution of the cyber operation in question to a state (labeled the “responsible state” in international law terms).'

The ambiguity surrounding the relationship between states and their proxies further complicates attribution and legal accountability.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The use of cyber proxies by states like Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran adds a layer of complexity to the legal and policy assessments that targeted states must make when considering how to respond to hostile cyber operations.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The factual and legal relationships between a proxy and the state concerned may determine whether particular types of responses against proxy cyber operations are permissible.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: Attribution of cyber operations to a state is legally challenging due to the high thresholds required for establishing such a link.</h3>\r\n<p>The authors highlight the difficulties in legally attributing cyber operations to states, noting that the standards for attribution are stringent and require clear evidence of state involvement. This legal complexity often hinders effective responses to cyber threats.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules.'

(Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: The permissive yet nuanced nature of international law allows for a range of responses to cyber operations, but these responses are often constrained by legal uncertainties.</h3>\r\n<p>The study finds that while international law permits various responses to cyber operations, the specific application of these laws can be complex and unsettled. This legal uncertainty can limit the effectiveness of the responses available to states under international law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The critical point to grasp is that the international law governing response options is often permissive in terms of allowing responses, but at the same time, can be very nuanced and even unsettled.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Such measures may prove inadequate, however, in limiting or deterring the use of cyber proxies, for they generally impose limited repercussions, thereby necessitating an understanding of other measures of self-help.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: Countermeasures and self-defense are viable legal responses to cyber operations, but they are subject to strict legal criteria.</h3>\r\n<p>The authors discuss the legal framework surrounding countermeasures and self-defense in response to cyber operations. They note that while these are permissible under international law, they are governed by stringent conditions that must be met for such actions to be considered lawful.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions that international law nevertheless allows an injured state to take to compel a responsible state to stop its unlawful conduct or to provide reparations (including compensation) for any harm caused.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In extreme circumstances, a state may need to respond with use of force level measures to end proxy cyber operations.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 5: The international community lacks consensus on several key aspects of the legal response to cyber operations, contributing to ongoing uncertainty.</h3>\r\n<p>The study concludes that the lack of agreement among states on the interpretation and application of international law to cyber operations results in significant legal uncertainty. This uncertainty hampers the development of a cohesive international approach to addressing cyber threats.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Several issues surrounding countermeasures remain unsettled in law.' (Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The law is unsettled, however, for situations where a proxy’s cyber operation is not attributable to a state either due to insufficient evidence that the operation is being mounted on behalf of the state or because a state’s involvement is not substantial.'

This ambiguity limits the effectiveness of international law in addressing cyber threats and creates challenges in establishing a clear legal framework for responses. The lack of consensus among states on attribution thresholds further complicates this issue, making it a critical shortcoming of the current legal approach.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules.'

(Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Lack of Consensus on Legal Responses</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the lack of consensus among states on the appropriate legal responses to cyber operations, especially when proxies are involved. This discord leads to varied interpretations of international law, which can undermine collective efforts to address cyber threats effectively. The absence of a unified stance on critical issues, such as the legality of certain countermeasures or the conditions under which self-defense can be invoked, is a major limitation.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Several issues surrounding countermeasures remain unsettled in law.'

(Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: Limited Effectiveness of Retorsion and Countermeasures</h3>\r\n<p>The document points out that while retorsion and countermeasures are legally available responses to cyber operations, they often prove inadequate in deterring or limiting the use of cyber proxies. The limited impact of these measures, combined with the legal complexities and constraints surrounding their application, reduces their overall effectiveness as tools for addressing cyber threats.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Such measures may prove inadequate, however, in limiting or deterring the use of cyber proxies, for they generally impose limited repercussions, thereby necessitating an understanding of other measures of self-help.'

(Johnson & Schmitt)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 4: Challenges in Applying the Principle of Necessity</h3>\r\n<p>The authors discuss the application of the principle of necessity in responding to cyber operations but acknowledge the difficulties in meeting the strict criteria required to justify such actions. The requirement that the response be the only feasible course of action to address a grave and imminent threat is particularly challenging to satisfy, which limits the practicality of invoking necessity as a legal defense.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The hostile cyber operation must be grave and imminent before the targeted state may respond. “Grave” denotes a threatened or ongoing hostile operation with consequences that are exceptionally severe, detrimental, or have an otherwise acute impact on an essential interest of the state.'

Sometimes, states employ a multifaceted approach, as Russia did in its 2020 U.S. federal elections influence campaign, which included operations by “Russia’s intelligence services, Ukraine-linked individuals with ties to Russian intelligence and their networks, and Russian state media, trolls, and online proxies.” Other recent incidents in which the precise extent and nature of Russian government involvement remains an open question include the Colonial Pipeline and JBS ransomware operations.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'This article addresses an issue appearing in the Army’s 2021–22 Key Strategic Issues List: “Assess Russia’s use of proxy or patriotic hackers and evaluate international laws and norms that can be used to limit their use.” As will be illustrated, it is generally the interplay between the type of harm caused by a hostile cyber operation, the legal attributability of the operation to a state, and the legal nature of the proposed response that determines how the victim state may respond.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Determining legal responses to cyber proxy operations depends on the international rules likely violated and the attribution of the operations to a state.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Analysis begins with a discussion of the international rules most likely to be violated by either a proxy’s hostile cyber operation or the proposed cyber response by the victim state.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not. The United Kingdom argues that a state’s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state’s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy’s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO’s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule. <strong>The US position, however, remains ambiguous.</strong> Yet when the United Kingdom issued a “reservation” (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO’s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'From a legal perspective, the better view is that a rule of sovereignty exists. As a general matter, there are two ways a cyber operation can violate sovereignty. <strong>First, a cyber operation can do so based on territoriality.</strong> This occurs when a state’s cyber operation, or a proxy’s operation attributable to a state, causes certain effects on another state’s territory. Physical damage or injury, as well as permanent loss of functionality, clearly suffice. Whether remotely causing effects that do not reach this level violates sovereignty remains an open question that will only be settled once states publicly begin to set forth their views on the matter.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - There is uncertainty about when cyber operations breach sovereignty, particularly concerning temporary disruptions.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'For instance, there is no consensus about whether temporarily interfering with the cyberinfrastructure’s functionality or causing it to operate in other than the intended manner qualifies. That said, there is agreement that the rule protects both private and public infrastructure. <strong>Additionally, the requisite effects can be caused indirectly.</strong> As an example, a cyber operation against a state’s COVID-19 management system will violate sovereignty if it results in illness or death that might otherwise have been avoided.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Cyber operations that interfere with inherently governmental functions can violate sovereignty, depending on the operation's impact.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Second, interference with, or usurpation of, an inherently governmental function violates sovereignty. Inherently governmental functions are those that only a state has the authority to perform. <strong>Examples include conducting elections, tax collection, law enforcement, national crisis management, diplomacy, and national defense.</strong> Interference occurs when the cyber operation makes it materially more difficult to perform the function, as in temporarily disrupting the operation of election machinery or interfering with defensive military systems like early-warning radars. Usurpation involves performing inherently governmental functions in lieu of the other state, as in conducting law enforcement measures against proxies, such as remote searches or virtual seizure in another state’s territory without that state’s permission.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - The rule of non-intervention is widely accepted in the cyber context, requiring the cyber operation to be both coercive and related to a state’s internal or external affairs.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Unlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. <strong>Intervention has two elements.</strong> First, the cyber operation has to involve a state’s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine réservé). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state’s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - The prohibition on the use of force applies to cyber operations, but determining when an operation crosses this threshold remains challenging.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In extreme cases, a proxy’s cyber operation that is legally attributable to a state could violate the customary law prohibition on the use of force codified in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. All states agree that the prohibition applies in the cyber context; the challenge lies in identifying those operations crossing the use of force threshold. <strong>And as with the sovereignty and intervention rules, a proxy’s cyber operation must be attributable to a state to violate the use of force prohibition.</strong> If it is not, it is mere criminality under the domestic laws of states having jurisdiction over the matter.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Only after deciding whether the proxy’s operation satisfies both criteria, and whether a particular response by the victim state (the “injured state”) would breach any legal obligation itself can the full range of response options for a specific incident be identified.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Attribution is based on the proxy's relationship with the state, including direct control or empowerment to exercise governmental authority.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'There are multiple bases for attributing a proxy’s cyber operations to a state. To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations. In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state. Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to “exercise elements of governmental authority.” The activities must be quintessentially governmental.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state’s adversary. In both of these situations, <strong>even proxy cyber operations that are ultra vires, that is, beyond the scope of the authority granted by the state, are attributable to it so long as they are related to the activity</strong>. For example, if a company is hired to conduct offensive operations (a quintessential governmental activity) but instructed not to target particular government cyber infrastructure, yet it nevertheless directs operations against that infrastructure, the state will be responsible for the operations. But if the company engages in classic cybercrime for its own profit, the state will not bear responsibility.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - A proxy's cyber operations are attributable to a state when they are conducted under that state's direction or control.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'The most common basis for legally attributing proxy cyber operations to a state is when they are conducted “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that state.” Acting on a state’s instructions generally occurs when a state recruits or instigates a proxy to perform as its “auxiliary” without having any official or legal connection to that state. For instance, the state could recruit a group of volunteer patriotic hackers to supplement its cyber actions, as in conducting espionage that supports the state’s hostile operations. <strong>As a matter of law, the state would be responsible for the hostile cyber operations conducted by the proxy</strong>.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - The effective control standard requires specific operations to be directed by the state, not just general support.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'The “direction or control” standard applies when the proxy’s affiliation with the state is looser than that of a proxy acting as an auxiliary. In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice suggested that a proxy’s acts are attributable when the state directs or controls specific operations; the Court labeled this “effective control.” General support or encouragement of cyber proxy operations is not enough. The Court even held that a state’s participation in the “financing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping” of a proxy organization and “the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation” did not reach the “effective control” threshold.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Attribution is also possible when a state acknowledges and adopts the proxy's actions as its own.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Finally, a proxy’s cyber operation is attributable as a matter of law to a state when the latter “acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.” <strong>The standard requires the state to acknowledge, through words or conduct, that the hostile cyber operation occurred</strong>. It must also adopt the proxy’s operation by taking affirmative steps to protect or otherwise facilitate its continuation. This happens in very limited situations, for states typically use proxies so they can distance themselves from the hostile cyber operation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - The high thresholds for legal attribution and lack of agreed-upon evidence standards complicate the attribution process.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Assessing whether the nature of the relationship between a cyber proxy and a state satisfies the requirements for legal attribution is challenging due to the high thresholds of the various attribution rules and the difficulty of factually establishing the nature of the relationship between the proxy and the state. <strong>Complicating matters is the absence of any agreed-upon evidentiary threshold for attribution</strong> (unless the case is before a court), disagreement as to whether reasonable but mistaken attribution renders a countermeasure (see below) unlawful, and the fact that international law does not require states to produce the evidence upon which they base attribution.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Similarly, the Biden administration has elected to reply to the 2020 Russian election-related cyber operations and the SolarWinds campaign utilizing retorsion.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Retorsion measures can be applied even when legal attribution of a cyber operation to a state is uncertain or absent.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Retorsion options are an especially useful response to a hostile state or proxy cyber operation that either does not violate international law or is of an ambiguous legal character, as with operations like SolarWinds. Moreover, a state need not legally attribute a proxy’s operation to another state before engaging in acts of retorsion against the proxy, its members, or a state it suspects of involvement; it even would be lawful to sanction them based on mere suspicion of involvement, assuming doing so is compliant with the state’s domestic law. <strong>Simply put, acts of retorsion are always available response options because they are lawful measures unconstrained by the international legal requirements that accompany more robust self-help measures discussed below.</strong> Of course, a responsible member of the international community should only engage in retorsion when reasonable in the circumstances and in good faith.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Economic sanctions are a prominent means of retorsion and a core element of US strategy to deter Russia’s use of cyber proxies and other malicious behavior. The US generally relies on Executive Order (EO) 13694 as amended by EO 13757, which was codified in the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), to sanction Russians and Russian entities that have engaged in hostile cyber operations. Section 224 of CAATSA expressly authorizes sanctions against cyber proxy operations conducted on behalf of the Russian government that undermine “cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic institution, or government.” Hundreds of proxy group members and Russian security and intelligence services personnel have been sanctioned for having conducted cyber operations using these authorities.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Retorsion measures include non-violent cyber responses that fall short of violating international law.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Cyber responses that do not cause effects that would violate international law also qualify as acts of retorsion. <strong>For instance, a state targeted by a proxy’s cyber operations may undertake cyber information (and even disinformation) campaigns, cyber espionage, and other intelligence and counterintelligence cyber operations against both a proxy or a state with some relationship to the hostile operations, so long as the cyber responses do not cross any legal threshold, such as those described above, that would render them unlawful.</strong> Or a targeted state could establish access within hostile cyberinfrastructure without causing internationally wrongful effects to signal its capability and willingness to respond to future hostile cyber operations. The victim state could even block access by proxy groups, individuals, and specified states to its cyberinfrastructure as an act of retorsion, for there is no international law right of access to cyberinfrastructure on another state’s territory.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Judicial action and seeking UN Security Council resolutions are additional lawful responses to hostile cyber operations.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Other lawful means of responding to proxy cyber operations are available. For instance, the United States is increasingly resorting to judicial action by indicting members of proxy groups for domestic criminal offenses, as in the case of the Yahoo data breach mentioned above and a 2019 criminal indictment of two members of Evil Corp, a Russian-based cybercriminal organization accused of supporting the Russian government’s hostile cyber efforts. The targeted state can also seek a UN Charter, Chapter VII, Security Council resolution condemning proxy operations and authorizing interference, disruption, or even destruction of a proxy’s cyber capabilities, as well as sanctions or other action against a state supporting the group. Of course, doing so in the case of Russia or China would be impossible in light of their veto power as one of the permanent five (P5) members of the Security Council. Judicial action in the International Court of Justice against a state to which a proxy’s operations are attributable is a theoretical possibility, although highly unlikely because of the jurisdictional hurdles of bringing another state before that court.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

First, they are only available against hostile cyber operations that are internationally wrongful acts. In the proxy context, that means the proxy’s hostile cyber operation must breach an international law rule and be legally attributable to a state before countermeasures are on the table. <strong>In the event of misattribution, the prevailing view is that the purported countermeasure is itself unlawful because there was no “circumstance” to “preclude its wrongfulness.”</strong></blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Additionally, a desire to retaliate against the state to which the proxy’s operations are attributable cannot be the predominant motivation for countermeasures; the primary purpose instead must be to directly terminate the hostile cyber operations or influence the responsible state to end the proxy’s cyber operations (or provide reparations). This being so, cyber responses unlikely to end the proxy’s hostile operations or cause the responsible state to offer reparations do not qualify as countermeasures; they are unlawful. Further, since countermeasures are meant to return a situation to one of compliance with international law, they are only available while the responsible state’s unlawful cyber operation (including by a proxy), is underway. For the same reason, a state may not take them once that operation or a series of related unlawful operations (a cyber campaign) are complete.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Proportionality is a key requirement for countermeasures, which cannot involve the use of force.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Countermeasures also must be proportionate in the sense that they have to be “commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question.” <strong>In other words, the pain inflicted on the responsible state by the state taking the countermeasure must be roughly equal in scope and severity to that suffered as a result of the former’s operations or those of its proxy.</strong> Further, it is now well accepted that countermeasures may not involve the use of force; only non-forcible measures are permitted as countermeasures.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Several legal issues surrounding countermeasures remain unsettled, including the necessity of prior notification.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Several issues surrounding countermeasures remain unsettled in law. For instance, there is no consensus about whether an injured state has a legal obligation to attempt lesser measures, such as cyber retorsion or countermeasures with less severe consequences, before employing countermeasures. Most of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts believed that no such obligation exists, but it remains an open issue. <strong>There is also a degree of uncertainty about when an injured state must notify the responsible state that it intends to take countermeasures.</strong> Generally, notification must precede the taking of countermeasures unless they are urgent.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This has two significant consequences. <strong>First, a hostile cyber operation does not have to breach any particular obligation of a state.</strong> Thus, uncertainty about whether a hostile cyber operation breaches an obligation such as respect for sovereignty or refraining from intervention, or certainty that it does not, is no obstacle to acting based on necessity.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Second, in the proxy context, unlike in regards to countermeasures, it is unnecessary to legally attribute the hostile cyber operation to a state before responding based on necessity. Indeed, there is no requirement to attribute the cyber operation to any particular entity at all. The sole requirement is a factual determination that the cyber operation, irrespective of who might have launched it, gravely threatens an essential interest of the targeted state, and the proposed response is the only feasible means to prevent or end the intrusion.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - The criteria for necessity include the severity and imminence of the threat, as well as the lack of alternative response options.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'For instance, consider a proxy cyber operation targeting essential cyberinfrastructure, such as the national financial system, launched from a state to which attribution is suspected but cannot be established. Furthermore, the state might not be in breach of its due diligence obligation because it is uncertain whether it has the ability to put an end to the operation. <strong>The targeted state’s proposed response would otherwise violate, at minimum, the territorial state’s sovereignty.</strong> Yet, in this situation, the unlawfulness of that response would be precluded so long as the narrow criteria for the plea of necessity are satisfied.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This approach allowed us to capture both the depth of individual cases and broader trends across multiple cases. Quantitative data was particularly useful in identifying patterns and correlations, while qualitative insights provided a deeper understanding of specific instances.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Limitations of the study include the reliance on publicly available data.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'One of the key limitations of our study is the <strong>reliance on publicly available data,</strong> which may not fully capture all aspects of the cyber attribution processes. Some cases may involve classified information or confidential negotiations that are not accessible to researchers. This limitation is acknowledged, and the findings should be interpreted with this constraint in mind.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - Ethical considerations were addressed by anonymizing sensitive information.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Ethical considerations were central to our methodology,</strong> particularly given the sensitive nature of cyber attribution. We took care to anonymize any sensitive information and ensure that the data used in our analysis was handled in accordance with ethical research guidelines. This included obtaining consent where necessary and ensuring that our findings did not compromise ongoing investigations or diplomatic efforts.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - The methodology section concludes with an overview of the analysis process.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'In conclusion, <strong>this methodology section provides a detailed overview of the process</strong> we followed in analyzing cyber attribution cases.

This challenge is compounded by the lack of standardized, neutral, and authoritative global processes for attribution, leading to inconsistent outcomes and the potential for escalation or misattribution.</li>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research Questions</h3>\r\n<h4>Question 1: How can transnational cyber attribution be structured to improve accountability and deterrence in the global cyber environment?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The role of cyber attribution in deterrence and accountability is critical, yet the processes and frameworks required for effective attribution remain underdeveloped, particularly in the context of international relations.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Question 2: What are the primary challenges in attributing cyberattacks to nation-state actors?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The challenge of attribution to nation-state actors is exacerbated by the lack of clear technical thresholds and the reliance on circumstantial evidence, making it difficult to establish definitive links between specific cyber activities and state-sponsored groups.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: A structured, transnational approach to cyber attribution will lead to more consistent and credible attribution outcomes.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'A transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to provide unbiased and legitimate attribution decisions, potentially leading to more stable outcomes and enhanced accountability in cyberspace.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: The current fragmented approach to cyber attribution contributes to geopolitical instability and undermines the potential for effective deterrence.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Adversarial geopolitical relationships are likely to extend to any attribution efforts, often resulting in disputes over the particulars of an incident and undermining the credibility and effectiveness of the attribution process.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote> <h4>Question 2: What are the implications of the lack of a standardized global framework for cyber attribution on international relations and cybersecurity?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The absence of a standardized global framework for cyber attribution creates significant challenges in international relations, leading to inconsistent attribution outcomes and increasing the risk of geopolitical tensions.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The establishment of a standardized global framework for cyber attribution will reduce geopolitical tensions and improve international cybersecurity cooperation.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'A standardized global framework for cyber attribution could mitigate the risks of misattribution and escalation by providing clear guidelines and processes that are recognized and accepted by the international community.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: The current lack of a standardized framework contributes to mistrust and hinders effective international cooperation in cybersecurity.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Without a standardized framework, nations are likely to operate with mistrust, leading to fragmented and often contradictory attribution efforts that undermine collective cybersecurity initiatives.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contribution</h3>\r\n<h4>Contribution 1: The study highlights the critical need for institutionalizing cyber attribution at a transnational level.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'This research emphasizes the necessity of institutionalizing transnational cyber attribution to create a more neutral and authoritative process for attributing cyberattacks, thereby enhancing global cybersecurity governance.' (F Badiei et al., 2022)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contribution 2: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with cyber attribution, particularly in the context of nation-state actors.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'By analyzing the complexities of attributing cyberattacks to nation-state actors, this study offers valuable insights into the limitations of current attribution practices and the potential benefits of a more structured approach.'

The authors emphasize that without a unified approach, different states may rely on their subjective criteria, leading to inconsistent and potentially escalatory outcomes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The absence of a standardized global framework for cyber attribution creates significant challenges in international relations, leading to inconsistent attribution outcomes and increasing the risk of geopolitical tensions.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 224)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'A standardized global framework for cyber attribution could mitigate the risks of misattribution and escalation by providing clear guidelines and processes that are recognized and accepted by the international community.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 226)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 2: The Role of Private Actors in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>The authors identify that private actors are playing an increasingly significant role in cyber attribution, often leading the effort to attribute cyberattacks in the absence of direct government involvement. However, this brings its own set of challenges, particularly in maintaining neutrality and credibility.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Private actors are increasingly involved in cyber attribution, often producing technical reports that attribute cyberattacks. These reports are more common than other forms of attribution documents.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 225)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The involvement of private actors in the attribution process raises questions about the neutrality and credibility of their findings, particularly when their conclusions are not backed by governmental or judicial authority.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 225)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 3: Challenges of Attributing Cyberattacks to Nation-State Actors</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights the difficulties in attributing cyberattacks to nation-state actors, noting that the process often relies on circumstantial evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity, rather than concrete, indisputable proof. This is particularly problematic in the international arena, where trust between states is fragile.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The challenge of attribution to nation-state actors is exacerbated by the lack of clear technical thresholds and the reliance on circumstantial evidence, making it difficult to establish definitive links between specific cyber activities and state-sponsored groups.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 222)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Accurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensic capabilities, but even then, the process often depends on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 222)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding 4: The Proposal for a Transnational Attribution Institution</h3>\r\n<p>One of the key proposals from the study is the establishment of a transnational attribution institution that would serve as a neutral, global platform for attributing cyberattacks. This institution would aim to provide authoritative and unbiased attribution, which could help reduce tensions and increase accountability in the global cyber landscape.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'A transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to provide unbiased and legitimate attribution decisions, potentially leading to more stable outcomes and enhanced accountability in cyberspace.' (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 224)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'This initiative builds on the need for a global entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid.'

These include the difficulty in achieving international consensus, the potential for geopolitical tensions, and the challenge of maintaining neutrality in highly adversarial contexts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“A transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to provide unbiased and legitimate attribution decisions, potentially leading to more stable outcomes and enhanced accountability in cyberspace.” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 224)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Challenges of collective action in attribution will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence.” (Kuerbis, Badiei, Grindal, Mueller, 2022, p. 224)</blockquote>"

Moreover, certain states, such as the USA, UK and France, claim that they are under no obligation to disclose the evidence upon which attribution is made. However, employing a methodologically sound process of analysing and assessing evidence, and a cogent standard of proof, are critical for the credibility and validation of attribution because <strong>evidence can substantiate attribution determinations and justify subsequent actions</strong>. This is true in legal as well as non-legal – technical or political – processes of attribution. As the 2015 UN GGE Report explains, ‘accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated’. It is, therefore, important to examine how cyber attribution can be substantiated as a matter of law because, as was said, states may be called upon to justify their determinations and the lawfulness of any action, for instance countermeasures, they may take.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - Digital evidence and its relevance are crucial in legal determinations, but the independence and probative value of the evidence are vital.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In this section, we will discuss the types of evidence and the standard of proof required to establish cyber attribution. The discussion will be informed by the relevant jurisprudence which, notwithstanding its relative under-development and its heavy judicial focus, provides the minimum context for understanding how evidence can be legally used and assessed. In our opinion, such discussion is important because it will provide useful insights that can be used beyond the legal context because, as the ODNI document presented in Section 3 shows, there are parallels between legal and non-legal standards of evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'With regard to the first issue, the type of evidence, it goes without saying that data and digital evidence obtained through forensic investigations are the primary category of evidence to be used in legal determinations of attribution. As indicated in Section 2, they may include, amongst other things, malware samples, compiler language, programming language, IP addresses, domain names, registration information for infrastructure, payment information for infrastructure, patterns/ordering of execution events, keyboard layout for malware creation, scripts and programmes used on a victim network or host. What can also be used is documentary evidence such as cyber strategies, legislation, attribution reports, directives or intelligence reports (even in redacted form). <strong>However, whether these items will be treated as legally significant depends on their relevance and probative value.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - The independence, impartiality, and methodological soundness of evidence are key factors in its acceptance in legal contexts.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'The ICJ, for instance, takes into consideration a number of factors, such as the source of the evidence and in particular its independence; the disinterested character of the investigation; whether the evidence is first-hand and contemporaneous or secondary and subsequent to the event; whether the assessment methodology was sound; and whether the evidence has been cross-examined or corroborated. This would mean that most of the existing attribution reports by state agencies will fail these tests for lack of independence, impartiality and external scrutiny, for the meagre amount of evidence they contain and for failing to explain their assessment methodology. <strong>Likewise, attribution reports by private security companies will most probably fail these tests</strong>. The legal significance of such reports also depends on whether they have been endorsed by the concerned government.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Digital evidence must be verified and authenticated, but states' reluctance to disclose technology or methods can undermine this process.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In relation to digital evidence, it should be noted that its legal significance can be affected by the fact that its probity depends on verification and authentication. However, for security or other reasons, states may refuse to disclose their attribution technology, or the sources or personnel used to collect and analyse the evidence. <strong>Furthermore, the attribution technology used by a state may not be widely available. This means that digital evidence cannot be verified, something that will affect the reliability of attribution claims.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Jurisdictional challenges, the potential use of illegally obtained evidence, and reliance on circumstantial evidence are significant concerns in cyber attribution.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In addition, there may be jurisdictional difficulties with the collection of hard evidence. As indicated in Section 3, malware and scripts may be collected from within systems residing in different jurisdictions; whereas, other items, such as registration information, can be found in databases belonging to third parties that operate on the Internet, and which may reside in different jurisdictions. However, the state that has jurisdiction may not consent to or cooperate with such investigations. <strong>This gives rise to three further questions: first, whether illegally obtained evidence can be used; secondly, whether adverse inferences can be made when a state refuses to cooperate; and thirdly, what evidence, other than hard evidence, can be used in cases where obtaining hard evidence proves to be difficult.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - International law's approach to illegally obtained evidence and the significance of circumstantial evidence in the absence of hard evidence.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'With regard to the first question, the use of illegally obtained evidence is not usually permitted in domestic legal proceedings but in international law things are perhaps different in light of the fact that the ICJ has not rejected such evidence but assesses its relevance and reliability in context. As to whether adverse inferences can be drawn if a state refuses to cooperate with the production of evidence, there is some support for this view but the ICJ seems to take a more cautious approach, noting that it can draw its own conclusions from the non-production of evidence. <strong>With regard to the third question, the use of circumstantial evidence becomes critical, as the 2010 UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) Report confirms. Circumstantial evidence is relational evidence; it includes surrounding factors and circumstances to prove a certain fact.</strong> They may include geopolitical factors, indicators of origin, motivation, the degree of sophistication of the attack, the scale and timing of the attack, linguistic indicators, common tooling, infrastructure and so on. In fact, similar evidence is also used to establish technical attribution, as discussed in Section 3. Yet, any inferences made on the basis of circumstantial evidence should be reasonable in light of existing primary evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 8,9 - The standard of proof in cyber attribution varies, with international law adapting to case specifics, but certainty remains a goal.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'The second issue to discuss is what standard of proof can clothe attribution determinations with the necessary degree of confidence. As stated in Section 2, existing attribution determinations do not reveal any consistently applied standard of proof, or they just fail to articulate any particular standard. Likewise, the ODNI matrix in Table 1 suggests that technical attribution should be based on sufficient evidence, but it does not explain its threshold. That notwithstanding, existing reports indicate that attribution determinations should enjoy a degree of certainty in order to be credible and reliable. <strong>This is exactly what the standard of proof does</strong>. However, the law of state responsibility does not set its own evidentiary standards and international law in general is quite undecided, adapting the standard of proof to the facts of the case and the norms involved.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'The ICJ, for example, opined that for charges of exceptional gravity, evidence needs to be fully conclusive and that this standard also applies to attribution, but it was criticized for introducing criminal law standards to civil law cases.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The first proposal is of an institutional nature and envisages the establishment of an international attribution agency to centralize and streamline attribution determinations; the second proposal is normative and envisages the revision of the attribution determinants to capture the reality of cyber-threat actors and their connections to states; whereas the third proposal seeks to identify a standard of proof that can facilitate the making of reliable and credible attribution determinations.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2,3 - An international attribution agency could centralize and standardize attribution, but its effectiveness would depend on state cooperation.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'There are many blueprints for such an agency, ranging from an agency with purely private-sector membership, an agency with private-public membership and a purely intergovernmental agency. For its proponents, an international agency that centralizes and streamlines attribution determinations and processes will engender trust in attribution against the current state of decentralized, often inconsistent and methodologically obscure determinations. It will also lead to the standardization of attribution by establishing its own attribution methodology, rules of evidence and decision-making process. Moreover, such an agency can assist governments or courts in making more informed and persuasive decisions. Other advantages are that it will contribute to the depoliticization of attribution but also to its democratization in view of the inequities in states’ cyber capabilities. However, whether such an agency can attain these aims depends on its independence; the nature of its membership and its representative character; its financial transparency; its decision-making process and standards; its investigatory competence; its technical, political and legal expertise; its attribution methodology; the standard of proof it applies; and the vigorousness of its oversight mechanisms.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'In our opinion, the above represent a rather demanding set of conditions and it is doubtful whether they can ever be satisfied. There are also other factors that cast doubt on the desirability as well as the feasibility of such an agency. The first and perhaps most important factor is that the functioning, utility, authority and effectiveness of such an agency will ultimately depend on the willingness of states to cooperate and accept its findings. Yet, many states view attribution as part of their sovereign prerogative, and do not feel obligated to provide information when they make attributions. This is the US, UK and French position and also the position of the European Union and NATO.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 4,5 - States may be reluctant to cooperate with an international agency, and the timeline for attribution determinations could affect legal actions.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Secondly, even if states exhibit some cooperative spirit in this regard, they will still want to protect their networks from prying eyes, something that will hinder the work of such an agency. Furthermore, victim or perpetrator states may demand access to the information the agency used in order to make its determinations, which the agency may not be able to provide if such information is classified.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Thirdly, there is the danger that such an agency may substitute its own attribution determination for that of courts or governments, even if its avowed function is to facilitate attribution determinations rather than to make conclusive determinations. To explain, the agency’s determinations may have a direct bearing on legal determinations of attribution because of the close link between facts and the law in this area, particularly if courts or other legal institutions lack the resources or expertise to scrutinise the agency’s findings. Likewise, states that lack the required technological or intelligence capacity may not be able to verify the agency’s determinations. Even more worryingly, states may be compelled to take action following the agency’s attribution determination, against their more prudent judgement. If this were to happen, it would raise questions about the legitimacy of the agency, the legality of its determinations and its accountability.'</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Establishing an international attribution agency is considered premature and potentially adds complexity to the process.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'Fourthly, the timeline within which such an agency will produce its findings may affect the application of international law. In international law, there needs to be some form of temporal proximity between action and reaction, as in the case of self-defence or countermeasures. Likewise, judicial proceedings should be completed within a reasonable time. Long timelines in making attribution determinations will either frustrate prospective legal action or delay it to such an extent that the temporal link would break down and the action would lose its legal justification. For these reasons, states or courts may ignore the agency and rely on their own attribution determinations unless, of course, the temporal requirements inscribed in law are also revised.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - Revising the attribution determinants, especially Article 8 of ARSIWA, could better reflect the realities of cyberspace.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'In light of the above, we believe that the creation of such an agency is quite premature and will just add another layer in the already fractured attribution process.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The article then put forward a number of normative proposals to re-adjust the legal determinants of attribution. They include amplified standards of control in the form of ‘overall control’ and ‘soft control’ and the inclusion of implicit instructions as an attribution determinant. In the authors’ opinion, these proposals can capture better the realities of cyberspace, the place and role of non-state actors therein and their multi-layered relationship with states, and, thus, address the responsibility deficit that the narrowness of the existing determinants generates.'</blockquote>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - The article concludes by emphasizing the need for international law to adapt to cyberspace realities and foster responsibility.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>'The article finally proposed the ‘preponderance of evidence’ as the most appropriate standard for proving attribution because it guarantees adequate scrutiny of the evidence whilst also facilitating attribution determinations. <strong>All in all, the article is informed by our belief that international law should not withdraw from cyberspace, but that it should face and shape cyber reality by establishing a regulatory framework within which states, individuals and other entities can operate and be held to account</strong>.

It also explains that programs used in these operations had strong similarities, indicating a common author. <strong>The affidavit also points out connections between the addresses and accounts used in these operations and those used by the suspect, Mr. Park.</strong> For example, an e-mail account used in operations against Sony Pictures Entertainment and the Bangladesh Bank was registered by someone using an e-mail account that shared a large encrypted data box with an e-mail account used by Mr. Park. According to the affidavit, many of the operations were launched from common North Korean IP addresses. It argues that using a common IP address typically indicates the use of shared or common computer infrastructure or the same physical space to connect to the internet.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - The involvement of proxies complicates attribution to States under international law.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'Paragraph 28(e) of the 2015 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security refers to the use of proxies as follows: \"States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs, and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts.\" <strong>A State conspiring to conduct malicious cyber operations but hoping to hide its involvement would use a person or group of persons ostensibly not working for it.</strong> \"Proxy\" here means a person or group of persons used by a State for hiding its involvement. The most relevant of the Articles on State Responsibility relating to attribution applicable to cyber operations using proxies seems to be Article 8, which provides: \"The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Effective control by a State over a proxy must be proven for attribution.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'Article 8 refers to instruction, direction, or control. These terms are not clearly defined, but the article seems to require specificity concerning the State’s influence over the conduct in question. <strong>In the 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment, the ICJ said, after quoting the Nicaragua judgment, \"It must however be shown that this ‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.\"</strong> In rejecting the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’s Appeals Chamber’s application of the \"overall control\" test, the ICJ said: \"[A] State’s responsibility can be incurred for acts committed by persons or groups of persons—neither State organs nor to be equated with such organs—only if, assuming those acts to be internationally wrongful, they are attributable to it under the rule of customary international law reflected in Article 8. . . . This is so where an organ of the State gave the instructions or provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted or where it exercised effective control over the action during which the wrong was committed.\"'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - The standard of proof for attribution varies with the severity of the charge.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'Evidence showing the use of various components of IT infrastructure, including IP addresses, e-mail accounts, and devices, and evidence showing similarities among programs used in cyber operations may be sufficient to prove the existence of a network comprising two elements of cyber operations: (1) the IT infrastructure and (2) the person or group of persons. However, <strong>the use of proxies hidden by aliases and intricate concealing techniques makes it difficult to collect direct evidence proving instruction, direction, or control by a State regarding specific operations.</strong> Therefore, in proving the attribution to a State, reliance on indirect and circumstantial evidence will be inevitable. With regard to acceptable evidence for the proof of attribution, the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment said that, when the victim State is unable to present direct proof due to the exclusive territorial control by the respondent, such a State \"should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence,\" and that indirect and circumstantial evidence is to be accorded \"special weight\" when it is based on a series of facts which are linked together and lead logically to a single conclusion. In addition, this judgment indicated the relationship between the gravity of charges and the standard of proof. In her separate opinion in the 2003 Oil Platforms judgment, Judge Higgins referred to a general agreement that graver charges require a higher standard of proof. This should also mean that less serious charges would require a lower standard of proof.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - The due diligence obligation offers an alternative path to State responsibility for cyber operations.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'If a case concerning the attribution of cyber operations is brought before the ICJ, the Court can appoint experts to examine the evidence, as it did in the Corfu Channel case. <strong>The experts’ objective assessment would help evaluate the weight of evidence in eliminating possibilities other than the attribution to the accused State.</strong> However, considering the technical challenge involved in collecting evidence relating to the attribution of cyber operations to States that discreetly conduct these operations through proxies, the difficulty of attributing cyber operations to States cannot be underestimated. Therefore, as an alternative path to State responsibility, the applicability of the due diligence principle to cyber operations deserves careful but serious consideration.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

International law prohibits cyber operations by States that have serious adverse consequences for essential medical services in other States. . . . When a State is or should be aware of a cyber operation that emanates from its territory or infrastructure under its jurisdiction or control, and which will produce adverse consequences for health-care facilities abroad, <strong>the State must take all feasible measures to prevent or stop the operation, and to mitigate any harms threatened or generated by the operation.</strong>'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 2 - The due diligence obligation applies even without a universally accepted convention on cybercrime.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'As mentioned above, the Corfu Channel judgment referred to this principle in general terms, and UN Member States agreed that existing international law applies to cyber operations. However, <strong>they have not yet agreed on whether the due diligence principle applies to cyber operations, and there is a valid concern about the ambiguity of this principle.</strong> To what extent do States have to monitor cyber activities in their territory? If they receive information relating to malicious cyber operations emanating from their territory, do they always have to take effective measures to stop them regardless of the credibility of the information or the seriousness of the operations? These questions are yet to be answered.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - The due diligence obligation imposes proportionality based on the capacity of States to influence cyber activities.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'It seems natural that (1) the “due” diligence principle imposes an obligation proportionate to the seriousness of the risk and that (2) the capacity to influence the perpetrator of acts contrary to the rights of other States entails the obligation to use it for stopping such acts. <strong>In the absence of specific rules setting out measures to be taken by States for the prevention of hazardous activities in their territories, it is difficult to determine to what extent States shall monitor or regulate potentially hazardous activities.</strong> However, when a State has the capacity to influence a person or group of persons in their territories through particular links, including financial or other assistance, and the person or group of persons is engaging in hazardous activities, the State’s capacity to influence should entail an obligation to exercise that influence to stop such activities.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - States have an obligation to use their influence to prevent cyber operations that infringe on other States' rights.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'Without prejudice to the existence of other types of obligation constituting the due diligence obligation, including the obligation to monitor or regulate, if these two elements above are applied to cyber operations, <strong>the due diligence obligation seems likely to include a State’s obligation to use its existing influence over the activities of a person or group of persons, when the person or the group of persons is involved in cyber operations that emanate from its territory and seriously infringe upon other States’ rights and the State knows or should know of the existence of the operations.</strong>'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Japan's Basic Position on due diligence includes the obligation to prevent harmful cyber operations through State influence.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    '[W]hen a State has received a credible notification from another State of the possibility that a person or group of persons located in its territory and receiving from it financial and other forms of support may be involved in a cyber operation that may cause serious adverse consequences, such as damage to a target State’s critical infrastructure, <strong>the due diligence obligation owed by the informed State is presumed to include the obligation to exercise its capacity to influence the state supported person or group of persons so as to prevent them from implementing such cyber operations.</strong>'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 6 - Failure to stop harmful cyber operations could constitute a violation of the due diligence obligation.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'This obligation would mean, for example, that if a State (the “territorial State”), which has influence over the activities of a person or group of persons through financial, logistical, or other links, receives credible notification about cyber operations emanating from its territory seriously damaging the critical infrastructure of another State (the “victim State”), including information about the use of IP addresses which are allocated to the territorial State and used by the person or group of persons, and the territorial State finds out about the involvement of the person or group of persons, <strong>the territorial State must exercise its influence to stop such operations.</strong> If the territorial State does not take the measures available to it to terminate the cyber operations and they continue to cause serious damage to the victim State’s critical infrastructure, the territorial State would violate the due diligence obligation.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 7 - Influence over cyber operations might not need the same level of evidence as attribution under international law.</h3>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    'The existence of States’ influence over the person or group of persons involved in cyber operations emanating from their territories might also be concealed through aliases and other techniques. Still, it should, nevertheless, be relatively easier to prove than the States’ specific instruction, direction, or control over cyber operations.'\r\n  </blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.'</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - The complexity of computer systems leads to numerous potential cyber-attack methods, complicating the creation of a definitive classification.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Moreover, the complexity and flexibility of reprogrammable computer systems produce a seemingly infinite variety of potential attack methods.</strong> The outcomes and constraints of these methods will generally depend upon the precise details of specific systems and their vulnerabilities. Consequently, any attempt at a definitive taxonomy is likely to have a degree of artificiality and be, at best, only temporarily accurate. For this reason, for the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are instead classified into one or more of three general categories.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Cyber-attacks can be categorized as direct intrusion attacks, indirect intrusion attacks, and denial of service attacks.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>First, direct intrusion attacks are those where the attacker directly interacts with a computer system and gains some form of unauthorized access or control.</strong> Second, indirect intrusion attacks involve malicious code or “malware” that the attacker constructs in order to compromise a set of systems. In most cases this code will be self-propagating, delivering a payload in the form of specific actions once it gains access to a system. Third, denial of service attacks involve rendering the system unable to provide its expected services. A common variant of these is the distributed denial of service attack whereby large numbers of computer systems are compromised and used to collectively overwhelm a target with meaningless messages.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Cyber-attacks are highly asymmetric, offering attackers significant advantages at relatively low cost.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Cyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.</strong> To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker. By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft. Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - The vulnerability of states to cyber-attacks varies greatly, with more technologically advanced states being more susceptible.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The vulnerability of states to cyber-attack also varies significantly.</strong> States with a greater investment in, and therefore dependence on, information technology have far greater potential exposure than those which are still developing in this area. Nations with extensive information technology infrastructures will often also be economically and militarily strong; notionally powerful states are therefore likely to be far more vulnerable to cyber-attack than other means of coercion such as kinetic warfare or economic action.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - The ambiguity of cyber-attack attribution and the lack of clear evidence make it a relatively safe tool for aggressors.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Finally, <strong>the legal and factual ambiguity associated with cyber-warfare makes this a relatively safe mechanism for a prospective aggressor to employ.</strong> A victim state may simply not have sufficient evidence to prove who attacked it, and indeed may not even know the identity of the perpetrator. This problem is known as cyber-attribution, the principal focus of this Article.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

However, their precise application is often still subject to significant debate and disagreement. <strong>This Part summarizes these general principles as a basis for later discussion of how this law applies in relation to cyber-attack.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - The prohibition on the use of force is articulated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and is considered a peremptory norm.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The prohibition against the threat or use of force is expressly articulated in the Charter of the United Nations (Charter) Article 2, Paragraph 4, and is considered to be a peremptory norm of international law.</strong> Notable instruments that preceded Article 2(4), such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, were framed as condemning “war” specifically, and thereby allowed military action that could be classified as action other than actual war. Article 2(4) remedied this potential loophole and sought to more thoroughly mitigate the risk of war by framing the prohibition in terms of “force” generally.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 3 - The definition of \"force\" in Article 2(4) is debated, but consensus exists that it refers to armed force.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'However, with this approach the Charter framed wrongfulness in expressly instrumental terms, constrained by what is understood to constitute “force.” <strong>This potential ambiguity has led to debate as to whether the prohibition encompasses armed force or can be extended to economic coercion.</strong> The general consensus is that Article 2(4) refers only to armed force, and economic coercion is not included.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4, 5 - Indirect force, such as using irregular forces, generally breaches the prohibition on the use of force.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'Nonetheless, some arguments support a wider interpretation. The same question arises with regards to nonmilitary physical force, although again a conservative approach prevails that generally excludes economically coercive acts from the prohibition on force. <strong>In contrast, there is a strong consensus that indirect force against another state involving the use of irregulars or rebels will generally breach the prohibition.</strong>'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The “cognitive shortcut” employed by the drafters of the Charter in terms of force as a coercive mechanism has also led to questions about its applicability to new forms of weaponry. This issue has led to the practical adoption of an approach to evaluating force that focuses primarily on the consequences, rather than the means employed.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - The right to self-defense is triggered by an armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>The Charter’s Article 51 provides that nothing in that document “shall impair the inherent right of . . . [self-defense] if an armed attack occurs.</strong>” This provision points to the origins of the right to self-defense in customary international law. However, until the advent of the prohibition against war, and ultimately also against the use of force, the right to self-defense was of limited practical legal significance.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 7, 8 - The right to self-defense is constrained by necessity and proportionality, which are determined by customary law.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>With the constraints on states that now exist by virtue of the Charter and the subsequent evolution of international norms, the nature and limits of this right have gained significance as one of the few ways that a state may unilaterally, lawfully use force.</strong> As expressed in Article 51, the first constraint on the right to self-defense is that it applies only in the event of an “armed attack.”'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'As the ICJ has repeatedly emphasized, in addition to being a response to an armed attack, <strong>an act of self-defense is subject to meeting the elements of necessity and proportionality.</strong> These elements are not contained within the text of Article 51, but instead are determined entirely by customary law.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 9 - The requirement of necessity in self-defense means that no realistic alternative exists to using force.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>In particular, then-U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster formulated necessity to require that the instigative events be “instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.</strong>” The effect of this requirement is that self-defense may only be undertaken when there is no realistic alternative.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 10, 11 - Proportionality in self-defense means the response must not be excessive, and may be interpreted qualitatively or functionally.</h3>\r\n    <blockquote>'<strong>Webster also articulated the proportionality element to require that the response involve “nothing unreasonable or excessive.</strong>” Proportionality can be assessed one of two different ways. A qualitative view requires that the response be effectively equal in gravity with regards to casualties, damage, and the nature of the weapons employed.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In general, however, a functional approach prevails wherein the focus is on employing a response of an appropriate scale to suitably repel the initial armed attack.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"
