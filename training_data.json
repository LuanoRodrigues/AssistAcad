The main conclusions emphasize the need for standardized evidence procedures to increase the credibility and trust in political attributions of cyberattacks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations. More substantiated attributions could lead to a better understanding of cyberattacks and increase trust.'

(Burleson et al., 2022, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Although it provides a net benefit in tracing illicit financial activity, transaction transparency makes users of blockchain technologies particularly vulnerable to fraud, social engineering, and theft of assets by bad actors.'

For each key term and definition found: - Use `<h3>` tags for the key term. - Use `<blockquote>` tags for quoting the definition exactly as it appears, including the exact citation format. **Example of output format**: ```html <h3>[Key Term]</h3> <blockquote> [Direct definition by the author exactly as found, including citations] </blockquote> ``` This format should be strictly respected and used for each definition found.Take your time, review the final output for accuracy and consistency in HTML formatting and citation-context alignment.\n\nnote1:output format:html in a code block."

The value of evidence law depends on the extent to which the truth can be revealed in the trial. When it comes to ‘blockchain evidence’, its evidentiary value should also depend on whether this type of evidence can effectively enhance the accuracy of fact-finding.'

However, this approach seems to weaken the relevance of the evidence.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Blockchain evidence is limited by its 'closed-loop authenticity' which might affect its function in proving the relevance of evidence.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Blockchain evidence is limited by its ‘closed-loop authenticity’, which in turn diminishes its function in proving the relevance of evidence, leading the challenging party and the authenticating party both into the trap of its ‘self-authenticating’.'

Evidentiary standards help ensure that attributions are perceived as more objective and reliable.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'More substantiated attributions could lead to a better understanding of cyberattacks and increase trust.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lack of Standardized Evidentiary Practices Across States</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights that there is no standardized practice across states regarding the provision of evidence when attributing cyberattacks. This lack of uniformity can lead to inconsistencies and disputes concerning the legitimacy of attributions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The current practice of political attribution is not standardized across countries. States can decide if they want to publicly provide evidence when attributing responsibility, how much evidence will be given, and what form such attribution will take.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It is noteworthy that joint attributions by a coalition of states have demonstrated to be particularly effective, especially due to an added degree of legitimacy.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>International Law's Ambiguous Role in Attribution Standards</h3>\r\n<p>The document discusses how international law currently lacks clarity regarding the standards of evidence necessary for attributing cyberattacks, which contributes to the variability and unpredictability in state responses.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Currently, States tend to avoid invoking international law when making political attributions of cyberattacks. This suggests that the law is weak – or worse, irrelevant – in holding states accountable for their cyber operations.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'International law is unclear regarding the standard of evidence that states must follow when accusing others of internationally wrongful acts.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages of Regulating Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n<p>Regulating evidentiary standards internationally could standardize the process of attributing cyberattacks, thus providing a more structured and universally acceptable framework that enhances the validity and acceptance of such attributions globally.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Establishing legal requirements will certainly make the process of attribution more complex. At the same time, substantiated public attributions would be more credible and it is likely that they would also provoke stronger political effects.'

It highlights the vulnerability this creates, making these systems prime targets for hackers, potentially leading to extensive damages.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Individuals, private organisations, and the public sector are increasingly reliant on digital technologies and infrastructures to function.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Importance of attribution in cyberattacks</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph discusses the critical role of attributing cyberattacks in determining responsibility and preventing future attacks. It explains the multifaceted nature of attribution, involving technical, legal, and political aspects.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'In this context, the attribution of a cyberattack is critical, considering its purpose of assigning responsibility for conducting a cyberattack.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 3,4 - Challenges and necessity of credible political attributions</h3>\r\n    <p>The discussion extends into the complications and significance of political attributions in cyberattacks. It emphasizes how such attributions must be credible and backed by evidence to effectively deter future cyber misconduct and uphold international norms.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Political cyberattack attributions, which are increasingly common, are critical to maintain strategic stability through deterrence and escalation control.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'However, such attributions might suffer from a lack of credibility if they are not accompanied by sufficient evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - The role of evidentiary standards</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph argues for the establishment of evidentiary standards to make political attributions of cyberattacks more trustworthy. It touches on the delicate balance of revealing sources and methods, which could be detrimental to state security.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Advancing the discourse on evidentiary standards</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs delve into the broader scholarly and institutional discourse advocating for enhanced procedural and substantive elements in the public attribution of cyberattacks. It hints at a shift towards the development of guidelines for evidentiary standards.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The process of attribution, including the procedural and substantive elements, has been widely debated.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'It has also been argued that the focus of this discussion should shift towards the development of evidentiary standard guidelines.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence defined digital evidence as \"any information of probative value that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form.\" This definition suggests that digital evidence includes information stored on a computer, passing through a computer, or extracted from a computer.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Volatile Evidence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    'Volatile evidence is any data that is stored in memory or exists in transit that requires constant power to maintain its existence. Volatile data is lost when a computer loses power or is turned off. It may be contrasted with non-volatile memory or \"persistent data\" which is stored on a hard drive, or another medium such as on floppy discs, and is preserved even after the computer is shut down.'

It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"These characteristics of digital evidence raise issues as to its reliability.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>International Law Enforcement Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>The document discusses the complications in international law enforcement cooperation due to jurisdictional boundaries, the varying capacities of countries to tackle cybercrimes, and the need for harmonization of legal procedures across borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 246)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Role of ISPs in Cybercrime Investigation</h3>\r\n<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a crucial role in cybercrime investigations. The study explores how ISPs can assist in tracing cyber attacks and preserving digital evidence, while also highlighting the challenges related to data retention and privacy concerns.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"ISPs generate log files in relation to each of these services, such as details of emails held on the ISP’s mail server computers.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"When a cyber attack occurs, preservation orders should be sought against ISPs who may have relevant evidence.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Legal and Ethical Issues in Digital Forensics</h3>\r\n<p>This topic delves into the ethical and legal considerations that digital forensic experts face while collecting and analyzing digital evidence, especially concerning the privacy of individuals and the authenticity of the digital artifacts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Digital objects bear less evidence of authorship, provenance, originality, and other commonly accepted attributes than do analog objects. The former are subject to additional suspicion.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 242)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Tests must be devised and administered to authenticate them.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 242)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Trends in Cybercrime and Security</h3>\r\n<p>The document outlines expected future trends in cybercrime activities and the necessary advancements in cybersecurity measures. It stresses the importance of ongoing research and technological advancement to stay ahead of cybercriminals.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The character of hacking has changed. It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"There is evidence that organised crime has recruited hackers to exploit weaknesses in IT security.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>"

It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation. These characteristics of digital evidence raise issues as to its reliability.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: If digital evidence handling and forensic procedures are standardized and improved, then the reliability of digital evidence in legal contexts will increase.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'There is an absence of generally recognised standards of best practice in digital evidence forensic procedures, and a lack of adequate training of forensic examiners.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Digital evidence requires specialized handling and preservation techniques to maintain its integrity and admissibility in court.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'...altering (inserting, modifying or deleting) digital records is so easy that it may happen accidentally... In contrast, analog technology makes alteration of analog records relatively expensive, and requires more skill and intent than changing digital records.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote><h4>Question 2: How does the international dimension of cyber crime complicate the investigation and prosecution processes?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: Enhancing international cooperation and harmonizing cybercrime laws will improve the effectiveness of cyber crime investigations and prosecutions.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The most important international initiative in this area is the Council of Europe’s Convention of Cybercrime, which was signed in 2001 and entered into force in July 2004.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: International jurisdictions share a common interest in combatting cybercrime, which facilitates cooperation despite differing national laws.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions. It was not geared towards the rapid tracing of data in real time or live mode.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>"

This shift has also seen a move from broad, less targeted attacks to highly sophisticated and targeted methods aiming to exploit specific vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Surveys from the private IT security industry and law enforcement indicate that the character of hacking has changed. It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead of using brute force attacks to overcome computer security, criminals are relying on targeted, stealthy and sophisticated scanning.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Utilization of Bot Networks in Cyber Crimes</h3>\r\n<p>The study reveals an increasing utilization of bot networks by cyber criminals to conduct various malicious activities, including spam distribution, click fraud, and even for ransom or extortion purposes, thereby presenting new challenges for cyber security and law enforcement.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'There is the insidious phenomenon of bot network which consists of a group of computers controlled by third parties without the consent of the owner of the computer.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Profit-seeking criminals have relied on bot networks for sending phishing emails/spam, engaging in \"click fraud,\" and/or for the purpose of blackmail/extortion.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges in International Cyber Crime Investigations</h3>\r\n<p>The research discusses the complexities of dealing with cyber crimes that involve multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the difficulties in cooperation and legal harmonization which significantly impede effective investigation and prosecution of international cyber crimes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Criminals exploit the Internet and other network communications which are international in scope. They launch cyber attacks from foreign countries, conceal evidence of their crimes in foreign locations, and take advantage of the weaknesses in international law enforcement co-operation.'

Secretary-General, then, the ambiguities of cyberspace “simply reflect the challenges ... that already exists [sic] in many contexts.”3 It is undeniable, however, that these challenges are particularly evident in the cyber context, where identifying who is behind a cyber operation presents significant technical problems.4 As has been effectively observed, “the Internet is one big masquerade ball.

(Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: If digital evidence is inherently volatile and easily manipulable, then its reliability as evidence in legal contexts is significantly diminished.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Digital evidence is inherently weak... Digital world objects are bits and bitstrings, exhibiting no measurable intrinsic physical properties (weight, size, age, and so forth).' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Digital evidence must be handled with enhanced forensic competencies to improve its admissibility and weight in legal proceedings.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'The law enforcement community will need to improve competencies in handling digital evidence if it is to meet this trend.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)\r\n</blockquote><h4>Question 2: What are the international legal challenges in tracking and prosecuting cyber criminals across different jurisdictions?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: If there is a lack of international cooperation and harmonization in cyber crime laws, then tracking and prosecuting cyber criminals across jurisdictions becomes significantly more difficult.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'The most important international initiative in this area is the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime... [which] seeks to balance privacy and law enforcement interests.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 246)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: Effective international cooperation and legal harmonization are essential for the successful prosecution of cyber crimes.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions. It was not geared towards the rapid tracing of data in real time or live mode.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 246)\r\n</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>The Fundamental Challenges of Prosecuting Cyber Crimes Due to Digital Evidence Limitations</h3>\r\n<p>The study emphasizes the inherent challenges in holding cyber attackers accountable, primarily due to the complexities and vulnerabilities of digital evidence. This evidence is often volatile, easily manipulated, and lacks physical properties that lend to verifiability and permanence, which significantly undermines its reliability in legal contexts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Digital evidence is inherently weak... Digital world objects are bits and bitstrings, exhibiting no measurable intrinsic physical properties (weight, size, age, and so forth).' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Digital evidence is different from evidence created, stored, transferred, and reproduced from a non-digital format. It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>International Jurisdictional Challenges Complicate Cybercrime Investigations</h3>\r\n<p>This finding discusses the complications arising from the international nature of cybercrime, where attacks traverse multiple jurisdictions, making legal prosecution difficult. These challenges include differences in national laws, lack of harmonization in law enforcement approaches, and the ephemeral nature of digital evidence which is often housed across borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The international scope of the Internet and network communications complicates efforts to prosecute cyber criminals, as evidence and perpetrators often reside in different jurisdictions.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Evolving Nature of Cybercrime and Its Implications for Digital Forensics</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies a shift in the nature of cybercrime, which has become more sophisticated and profit-driven, often involving organized crime groups. This evolution necessitates a corresponding advance in digital forensic techniques and practices to effectively address the increasingly complex and stealthy nature of cyber attacks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The character of hacking has changed... It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead of using brute force attacks to overcome computer security, criminals are relying on targeted, stealthy, and sophisticated scanning.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Critical Role of Enhanced Competencies in Handling Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>The research underscores the need for law enforcement and judicial systems to improve their understanding and handling of digital evidence. This includes training for forensic practitioners and developing standards to ensure the integrity and admissibility of digital evidence in court proceedings.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The law enforcement community will need to improve competencies in handling digital evidence if it is to meet this trend.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'There is an absence of generally recognised standards of best practice in digital evidence forensic procedures, and a lack of adequate training of forensic examiners.'

The focus is primarily on broad, conceptual barriers without delving into specific legal frameworks or case studies from varied jurisdictions that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the practical application of these concepts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions. It was not geared towards the rapid tracing of data in real time or live mode.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 246)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dependence on Technological Competence</h3>\r\n<p>The document emphasizes the critical need for enhanced forensic competencies without adequately addressing the current shortcomings in training and standard practices among forensic professionals. This reliance on the assumption of improved skills can be seen as a significant limitation if the current educational infrastructure does not support such advancements.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The law enforcement community will need to improve competencies in handling digital evidence if it is to meet this trend.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“There is an absence of generally recognised standards of best practice in digital evidence forensic procedures, and a lack of adequate training of forensic examiners.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 242)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vulnerability and Manipulation of Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>While the paper points out the vulnerabilities and ease of manipulation of digital evidence, it does not propose concrete solutions to these issues, nor does it explore the implications of these vulnerabilities on past cybercrime cases. This omission may limit the utility of the findings for practitioners seeking actionable strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Digital evidence is different from evidence created, stored, transferred, and reproduced from a non-digital format. It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Digital evidence is inherently weak... deciding whether a bitstring is genuine or synthetically generated is difficult.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Insufficient Data on Cybercrime Trends</h3>\r\n<p>The discussion on the evolving nature of cybercrime is supported by general statements rather than robust empirical data. This lack of detailed statistical analysis or recent trend data may undermine the credibility of the assertions made regarding the motivations and behaviors of modern cyber criminals.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“Instead of using brute force attacks to overcome computer security, criminals are relying on targeted, stealthy and sophisticated scanning.” (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>"

However, it cannot prevent the \"original malice\" where evidence has already been altered or forged before being added to the blockchain.' (Su, 2024, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Blockchain evidence is not an independent form of evidence but a blockchainised form of existing statutory evidence formats, which enhances the evidentiary power of case facts by improving the authenticity and integrity of evidence.'

This creates a significant gap in the security and reliability of blockchain evidence, particularly in legal contexts where the integrity of initial evidence is crucial.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Blockchain evidence can only ensure that once the evidence is on the chain, it cannot be tampered with. However, it cannot prevent the 'original malice' where evidence has already been altered or forged before being added to the blockchain.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The aforementioned characteristics of blockchain evidence lead to debates over whether it can effectively enhance the accuracy of ascertaining the facts of cases and whether it holds value in the meaning of evidentiary law.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 2: Limited Resistance to Sophisticated Cyber Attacks</h3>\r\n<p>Blockchain's architecture, while robust against many forms of tampering, can still be compromised through sophisticated cyber attacks, particularly those targeting network connections or consensus mechanisms.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Blockchain evidence is not theoretically absolutely tamper-proof as the peer-to-peer network connection of the blockchain increases the possibility of being attacked during the information transmission process.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The reason why blockchain evidence is not theoretically absolutely tamper-proof is that the peer-to-peer network connection of the blockchain increases the possibility of being attacked during the information transmission process.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Shortcoming 3: The 'Phasic' Nature of Blockchain Evidence's Authenticity</h3>\r\n<p>Blockchain can only confirm the integrity and authenticity of evidence from the moment it is recorded. This 'phasic' authenticity limits its applicability in scenarios where prior validation of data is required.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'This chain-like storage means that the authenticity of blockchain evidence exhibits significant phasic characteristics (within a specific period), when there is no other evidence to prove the authenticity of the blockchain evidence before it is added to the chain, its evidentiary capacity is flawed.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The anti-tampering attribute of the blockchain is achieved through the hash algorithm... However, due to the phasic characteristics, the following situations may occur in practice: first, the blockchain evidence is generated off-chain as forged and then uploaded to the blockchain; second, the evidence was generated on the blockchain, but the party presenting the evidence uploaded multiple 'versions' of a particular fact.'

(Leroux, 2004, p. 195)</blockquote><h4>Question 2: How do differences in evidence rules between continental law countries and common law countries affect the admissibility of electronic evidence?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Issues concerning the admissibility, similarities and differences in the rules of evidence in criminal law must be examined. There are first similarities between the systems because presumption of innocence exists in all, even if it is often limited in special situations. Differences however, exist about freedom or restriction of the types of proof.'

In this case the rules concerning the manner and procedure for submitting evidence are applied differently, for instance those concerning discovery or the sanction for illegally obtained evidence.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 195)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: The foundational legal principles regarding the admissibility of evidence are universally accepted across different legal systems.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The main aim of this report is to analyse the legal issues relating to the admissibility of the electronic evidence by the analysis of legal rules in the EU and more specifically in Belgium, France, UK and Italy.'

(Leroux, 2004, p. 194)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Issues relating to the admissibility of the evidence are therefore to be distinguished from questions relating to the relevance of the proofs, the most relevant evidence potentially being more prejudicial for the whole judicial process (whether it be civil or criminal) than no evidence at all.'

This report aims to briefly present the core principles of the law when handling electronic evidence.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 193)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Differences in Evidence Rules Across Legal Systems</h3>\r\n<p>The paper explores the significant differences between common law and civil law systems regarding the handling and admissibility of electronic evidence, particularly how these differences affect legal outcomes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'A primary distinction must be made between continental law countries (Belgium, France, and Italy) and common law countries (England).' (Leroux, 2004, p. 195)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Role of Electronic Evidence in Modern Judiciary Systems</h3>\r\n<p>This topic examines the growing importance of electronic evidence in judiciary systems and its impact on the administration of justice, highlighting the technical and legal complexities involved.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Compromised evidence could have major consequences on the judicial trial if its admissibility is disputed or, to a lesser extent, if it is not considered as relevant.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 194)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Integrity and Authentication of Electronic Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>Focuses on the necessity for electronic evidence to be authenticated and maintained with integrity to ensure its admissibility and reliability in legal proceedings.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The electronic document must identify the person from whom it emanates, and the integrity of the electronic document must be guaranteed.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 201)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges in Forensic Investigation of Electronic Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>Details the specific challenges faced by forensic experts in the collection, preservation, and interpretation of electronic evidence, underlining the specialized knowledge required to handle such evidence legally and effectively.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Finally, the gathering of evidence will suppose a strong computing knowledge as well as legal capacities to collect this evidence in respect to legal requirements: its admissibility before a court must not be altered.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 196)</blockquote><h3>Top Five Authors and Their Footnotes</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Leroux (2004)</h4>\r\n<h5>Footnote 47: 'This rule means that the court will give most credence to the best evidence available, such as original documents or oral testimony.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</h5>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<cite>'By virtue of the best evidence rule, a document is in principle only admissible if it is produced in its original version.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Footnote 48: 'Unfortunately, however, the scope of the various exceptions depends on rules of evidence that are often no less technical than the exclusionary rules themselves.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</h5>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<cite>'Exceptions to the best evidence and hearsay rules.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Footnote 49: 'In the common law system, the hearsay and best evidence rules theoretically prevent the admissibility of computer documents before the courts.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</h5>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<cite>'The question whether computer files and printouts are inadmissible hearsay evidence or fall under one of these exceptions has been subject to extensive debate.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 204)</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Footnote 50: 'By virtue of these conditions, a computer document will be admissible as evidence if it was produced by a computer operating properly, which is regularly used for the normal activities of its user and supplied with information of the kind contained in the document put forward as evidence.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 205)</h5>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<cite>'Applied to computers, this rule means that a computer document is admissible if the person who loaded the data had a personal knowledge of it.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 205)</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h5>Footnote 51: 'Parties arguing for the admissibility of computer-generated records tend to rely on either the statutory business record rules in the various evidence acts or on the common law business records exception to the hearsay rule.' (Leroux, 2004, p. 205)</h5>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<cite>'In jurisdictions that have to date not implemented, or in the future do not implement evidence law provisions taking cognisance of computer-generated evidence in their evidence law statutes.'

(Vedwal, 2023, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Digital evidence, especially, should be conveyed to the jury in simple terms, as opposed to presenting it in the form of a binary dump to a jury who is computer-illiterate.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 6)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Importance of Following Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)</h3>\r\n<p>The document repeatedly underscores the importance of adhering to standard operating procedures during the collection and handling of digital evidence to ensure its admissibility in court. The proper documentation and consistent application of SOPs are crucial to prevent evidence from being deemed inadmissible.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Following the standard operating procedure (SOP) during the acquisition and handling of evidence is the basic requirement to make evidence admissible in court.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Failure to stick to the SOP during the acquisition of evidence and improper documentation and reporting can make the evidence unusable.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Integration of Digital Evidence in Cybercrime Investigations</h3>\r\n<p>The findings suggest that the integration of digital evidence is crucial for the success of cybercrime investigations. The study discusses how digital evidence serves as a cornerstone in both understanding and prosecuting cybercrime effectively, highlighting the evolving legal frameworks that support its use.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Digital evidence is essential to the investigation of cybercrime.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 16)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Information Technology Act of 2000 and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 both regulate the admissibility of digital evidence.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Complexity of Admissibility of Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>This finding elaborates on the complexities associated with the admissibility of digital evidence in legal proceedings. The study explains the detailed criteria that digital evidence must meet to be considered admissible, which includes being reliable, authentic, complete, and understandable.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'To be admissible in court, the evidence should possess the following characteristics: Admissible, Authentic, Complete, Reliable, and Believable.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Admissibility of evidence refers to the application of a set of legal rules by a judge to determine whether or not the evidence may be proffered.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Legal Frameworks Supporting Digital Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>The research identifies and explains the critical role of specific legal frameworks like the Information Technology Act 2000 in enhancing the acceptance and use of digital evidence in Indian courts. These frameworks provide the legal backing needed to ensure digital evidence is both accepted and has probative value in judicial proceedings.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Sections 4 to 6 of the IT Act recognizes the use of legally recognizes the electronic records.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 7)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The second schedule of The Information Technology Act 2000, the only law in India that addresses computer crime, adds the idea of electronic evidence to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.' (Vedwal, 2023, p. 7)</blockquote>"

Over time, however, the Court has shown a more restrained approach, especially noted in the Crime of Genocide case.'

(Scharf and Day, 2012, p.124)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The ICJ's approach to the non-production of critical evidence has evolved, particularly highlighted in their recent judgements, which are less inclined to draw adverse inferences simply based on non-production alone.' (Scharf and Day, 2012, p.133)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Consistency and Coherency in Evidential Standards</h3>\r\n<p>This finding addresses the need for the ICJ to develop a consistent and coherent methodology in dealing with evidential challenges, advocating for clearer standards that could guide future cases.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'This study proposes that the ICJ needs to adopt a more coherent and predictable approach to dealing with circumstantial evidence and adverse inferences to enhance legal predictability and fairness in international law.'

Because of this flexible approach, the Court has not found the need to articulate its evidence policy in many cases.\" </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Over the years, the ICJ has taken a flexible approach to the admissibility of evidence.\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Impact of Exclusive Evidence Control:</h3>\r\n<p>The discussion focuses on how exclusive control over critical evidence by one party impacts judicial interpretations and decisions at the ICJ.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"So what happens when one of the parties has exclusive access to critical evidence and refuses to produce it for security or other reasons?\" </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Court delineated procedural, evidentiary, and equitable rules that have shaped many of the Court's subsequent decisions.\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evidentiary Challenges in International Law:</h3>\r\n<p>This topic examines the broader implications of evidentiary challenges faced by the ICJ, particularly in the context of international law and justice.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Despite this history of flexibility, the Court was candid about its decision to use Crime of Genocide to clarify the Court's evidentiary standards.\" </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The judgment is particularly poignant given the fact that the Court's docket currently includes cases that deal with complex issues of international law.\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Judicial Practices in Assessing Evidence:</h3>\r\n<p>Insights into how the ICJ assesses and weighs evidence, highlighting the judges' qualifications and the judicial process involved.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"One possible reason for the Court's malleable approach, according to the ICJ's former Registrar, Eduardo Valencia-Ospina, is the Court's perceived ability to 'ascertain the weight and relevance of particular evidence' due to the judges' qualifications and experience.\" </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"This may be in part because of domestic courts' power to compel production of evidence. The ICJ, on the other hand, can merely 'call upon the agents to produce any document or to supply any explanations.'\" </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Case Law and Precedent Impact:</h3>\r\n<p>This topic addresses how previous case law influences the ICJ's current approaches to evidentiary standards and judicial decision-making.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Having disclosed and explained the nuances of the ICJ's approach to nonproduction of evidence in the exclusive control of a party, a final question is whether the Court's approach could be modified to better ensure the fair treatment of such cases.\" </blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Court's limited reliance on circumstantial evidence in past cases has set a precedent that impacts its current judicial practices.\" </blockquote>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"

Despite the urgent need for sharing classified data to enhance maritime safety and security, the existing infrastructure lacks the requisite secure network architecture to facilitate this. This discrepancy between necessity and capability presents a significant challenge.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The actualized CISE network do not support classified information sharing as mentioned earlier. However, the EU-CISE2020 Deliverable D8.3 'Dissemination plan with Policy recommendations and Governance model' states that CISE must allow the exchange of classified data, for instance in a parallel embedded secure network architecture, as significant amount of maritime reporting and surveillance data are treated confidentially.\" (Rajamäki et al., 2019, CISE as a Tool for Sharing Sensitive Cyber Information in Maritime Domain)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fragmented Organizational Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies organizational cooperation as fragmented, which hampers effective cyber information sharing in the maritime domain. The outsourcing of network controlling to external entities limits the cooperation between different maritime authorities, potentially compromising the responsiveness and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The organisational limitation is based on observation in which the maritime authorities have outsourced the network controlling and therefore co-operation might be limited between the actors. On the other hand, CISE network itself and the traffic inside the network has to be controlled by the Members States and whenever a cyber-threat is found in one MS it should be informed to the other MSs.\" (Rajamäki et al., 2019, CISE as a Tool for Sharing Sensitive Cyber Information in Maritime Domain)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lack of Common Data Standards</h3>\r\n<p>The absence of common data standards and models for information sharing within the CISE network is another crucial limitation highlighted in the document. This lack leads to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in data exchange across different maritime surveillance systems, impacting overall maritime security and safety.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"A wide scale of open or undiscussed issues of cyber information exchange exists among maritime CISE consortium.

The authors highlight how these legislative changes provide a clear and robust foundation for accepting electronic records as evidence, thereby modernizing judicial processes in response to digital advancements.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The introduction of Section 65-A and 65-B in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides the validity to the digital evidences and valid authenticity to the electronic records produced as an evidence.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The massive change helped the contesting parties to produce the evidence not only in documents or by way of oral evidence but also includes electronic evidence that may be considered as primary evidence even conditions prescribed under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act are satisfied and fulfilled.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges in Cyber Forensics</h3>\r\n<p>The research discusses the various challenges faced in cyber forensics, particularly emphasizing the difficulties in managing and presenting digital evidence. It notes that despite legal advancements, practical challenges such as data integrity, evidence tampering, and technological limitations persist, complicating the acceptance and reliability of electronic evidence in judicial proceedings.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The process of accepting electronic evidences under section 65B is hostile but requires a strict interpretation in order to curb the most practiced cybercrimes like child pornography, online grooming, hacking, data theft etc.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 891)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Biases, examiner inexperience and pressures to process cases with limited time resources can also challenge the validity of electronic evidences.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 892)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Judicial Perspectives on Electronic Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>This finding discusses how judicial interpretations and court precedents play a crucial role in shaping the admissibility and treatment of electronic evidence. The study points out several landmark judgments that have clarified the legal positions and set precedents for future cases, thus aiding in the consistent application of the law across different scenarios involving digital evidence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Analyzing the case of Anver P.K. v. P.K. Basheer & Ors. Case, the Supreme Court has noted that ‘there is revolution in the way that evidence is produced before the court.’' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 889)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'In case of Arjun Panditrao Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao Goranyal, the 3-judge bench of RF Nariman, S. Ravindra Bhat and V. Ramasubramanian, JJ held that the certificate required under Section 65-B (4) is a condition precedent to the admissibility of evidences by way of electronic record.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 891)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Evolving Nature of Cyber Law and Evidence</h3>\r\n<p>The authors assert that the field of cyber law and the management of digital evidence are continuously evolving. They highlight the necessity for ongoing legislative adjustments and judicial adaptability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting digital communications and transactions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The amendment also brought a vast change in the interpretation and acceptance of electronic evidence in the court of law.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'As the pace and proliferation of technology is expanded, and the creation and storage of electronic information is constantly changing, there exist a need to change and modify the laws substantially and systematically.' (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 889)</blockquote>"

This focus limits its applicability in a global context, where diverse legal systems have varying approaches to digital evidence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“The enactment of the legislation helped in dealing with issues relating to cyber space... The act in addition to the substantive law has made incidental and consequential changes in the Indian Penal Code, The Indian Evidence Act, the Banker’s Book Evidence Act and Reserve Bank of India Act etc.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The paper discussed the provisions incorporated under the Indian Evidence Act and IT Act dealing with meaning of cyber forensic, electronic records, electronic evidences and role of controller to authorize the validity of digital signature.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 886)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technological Evolution Outpaces Legal Adaptations</h3>\r\n<p>The document points out that rapid technological changes continuously challenge the existing legal frameworks, implying that the current amendments may soon become outdated. This ongoing evolution necessitates frequent updates to the legislation, which the paper does not fully address how to implement proactively.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“As the pace and proliferation of technology is expanded, and the creation and storage of electronic information is constantly changing, there exist a need to change and modify the laws substantially and systematically.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 889)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The introduction of Section 65-A and 65-B in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides the validity to the digital evidences and valid authenticity to the electronic records produced as an evidence.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dependence on Judicial Precedents Over Empirical Data</h3>\r\n<p>The research heavily relies on judicial interpretations and court rulings without incorporating empirical data or statistical analysis to support its conclusions. This approach might not adequately capture the practical implications and effectiveness of the legal amendments in handling digital evidence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“Analyzing the case of Anver P.K. v. P.K. Basheer & Ors. Case, the Supreme Court has noted that ‘there is revolution in the way that evidence is produced before the court.’” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 889)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“In case of Arjun Panditrao Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao Goranyal, the 3-judge bench of RF Nariman, S. Ravindra Bhat and V. Ramasubramanian, JJ held that the certificate required under Section 65-B (4) is a condition precedent to the admissibility of evidences by way of electronic record.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 891)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Insufficient Discussion on Enforcement and Practical Implementation</h3>\r\n<p>The paper outlines the legal frameworks and amendments effectively but does not delve deeply into the enforcement challenges or the practical implementation of these laws in everyday legal practices. It leaves unaddressed how these laws are applied on the ground, particularly in complex digital forensics scenarios.</p>\r\n<blockquote>“This massive change helped the contesting parties to produce the evidence not only in documents or by way of oral evidence but also includes electronic evidence that may be considered as primary evidence.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 887)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>“The term digital evidences means any information or data of value to an investigation that is stored on, received by, or transmitted by an electronic device.” (Nathani and Gautam, 2021, p. 888)</blockquote>"

(Insa, 2007, p. 285)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: The admissibility of electronic evidence varies significantly across different European states due to the lack of uniform legislation.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Electronic evidence has been used in most states in Europe for several years, although the obtaining, seizure, analysis, and presentation of electronic evidence before an adjudicator is carried out in different ways in each member state.' (Insa, 2007, p. 285)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Standardized European legislation could improve the admissibility of electronic evidence across member states.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Other goals were to identify the gaps found in the different regulations on the admissibility of e-evidence and create a European network for cooperation in proceedings and practices related to the admissibility.' (Insa, 2007, p. 285)\r\n</blockquote><h4>Question 2: How are electronic evidence handling practices perceived by legal professionals and technical experts across Europe?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'To understand the problems confronting the social agents who intervene in a forensic analysis of electronic media and how they are dealing with it, it was also necessary to carry out many in-depth interviews with the professionals involved in the obtaining, analysis, and presentation of electronic evidence in court.' (Insa, 2007, p. 286)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The perception of electronic evidence’s reliability varies significantly among judges and technical experts in Europe.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Not all the actors interviewed for this study conferred the same advantages to electronic evidence. Concerning the reliability of such evidence, some judges believe that the precision and objectivity of the electronic evidence make it more reliable; other judges think that the lack of means to verify the authenticity of the electronic evidence makes it more vulnerable and, therefore, less reliable than traditional evidence in general.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: The adoption of uniform procedural standards for electronic evidence across Europe would enhance its credibility and reliability in legal proceedings.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n'Procedural standards do not include any specific procedure to regulate the collection, preservation, and presentation of electronic evidence in court. Nonetheless, investigators have observed how countries usually apply by analogy the general rules and procedures for the traditional evidence.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)\r\n</blockquote>"

                "content": "<h3>Varied Legal Definitions and Standards Across Europe</h3>\r\n<p>The study uncovers a significant variance in the legal definitions and standards applied to electronic evidence across different European countries, highlighting a lack of uniformity that affects the admissibility and reliability of such evidence in legal contexts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The deep legislative review in the sixteen countries showed no explicit references to \"electronic evidence.\"' (Insa, 2007, p. 286)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'None of the studied countries stipulate in their legal codes a specific definition of what electronic evidence is.' (Insa, 2007, p. 286)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Equivalence of Electronic Evidence to Traditional Forms</h3>\r\n<p>The study finds that electronic evidence is often treated on par with traditional documentary evidence, despite the absence of explicit legal definitions, with several countries recognizing equivalences such as between electronic and paper documents, and electronic and handwritten signatures.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Electronic evidence is equivalent to traditional evidence in all the countries under study.' (Insa, 2007, p. 286)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'There is a group of countries that expressly assimilate electronic documents with paper support documents and give them the value as documentary evidence in a trial.' (Insa, 2007, p. 286)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Discrepancies in the Perception of Electronic Evidence's Reliability</h3>\r\n<p>This finding highlights differing opinions among judges and technical experts regarding the reliability of electronic evidence. Some view it as more objective and reliable due to its precision, while others cite vulnerabilities related to authenticity verification as a reason for its potential unreliability.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Concerning the reliability of such evidence, some judges believe that the precision and objectivity of the electronic evidence make it more reliable; other judges think that the lack of means to verify the authenticity of the electronic evidence makes it more vulnerable and, therefore, less reliable than traditional evidence in general.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lack of Specific Procedural Standards</h3>\r\n<p>The study identifies a critical gap in procedural standards for the handling of electronic evidence, with most jurisdictions lacking specific regulations, thus often relying on general rules applied analogously from traditional evidence procedures.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Procedural standards do not include any specific procedure to regulate the collection, preservation, and presentation of electronic evidence in court.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Countries usually apply by analogy the general rules and procedures for the traditional evidence: 48 percent of the rules analyzed contemplate procedural processes that can also be applied for electronic evidence.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Need for Harmonization and Specific Regulations</h3>\r\n<p>The conclusion drawn by the researchers advocates for the harmonization of electronic evidence regulations across Europe and the introduction of specific legal standards to ensure a consistent approach to its treatment and admissibility in court.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Most jurists think there should be rules of minimum standards.' (Insa, 2007, p. 288)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Legal experts and computer forensic specialists coincide in the fact that there must be specific precepts contributing to legal security.'

(Insa, 2007, p. 287)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Limited Jurisdictional Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>There is a noted lack of systematic cooperation between jurisdictions in handling electronic evidence, which might impair the effectiveness of cross-border legal actions and the prosecution of international crimes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'There must be specific precepts contributing to legal security.

(Insa, 2007, p. 289)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges in Legal Education and Understanding</h3>\r\n<p>The document indicates challenges in legal education and understanding regarding electronic evidence, where many legal professionals lack the technical knowledge necessary to effectively handle and interpret electronic evidence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'For computer experts, some inconveniences are the lack of legal support and certification models, the lack of understanding shown by judicial agencies in Europe, as well as the heavy costs related to the obtaining and interpreting electronic evidence, a very time-consuming task.' (Insa, 2007, p. 287)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Other interviewees talk about the fact that judges and prosecutors do not understand very well this kind of evidence and that is the reason why they often reject it in trials.'

(Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 147)</blockquote><h4>Question 2: What legal and operational challenges are faced in accessing data across borders in cloud computing environments, and how can these be effectively addressed?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'To address this question, in December 2014 the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY)–the entity representing the Parties to the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime–established a Cloud Evidence Working Group (CEG) which was tasked with identifying solutions by the end of 2016.'

Nationality of owner of data? Location of owner of data? Nationality of data owner? Location of data controller? Headquarters of a cloud service provider? Subsidiary of a cloud service provider?

(Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 148)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>IP address</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'The IP address is a unique address represented by a number, which identifies the device over the Internet. It is important to underline, with regard to criminal investigations, that an IP address identifies only the device and not the user behind it.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 148)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Phishing</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'Phishing is one of the most widespread cybercrimes that consists of computer fraud to obtain sensitive information of the victim, such as credit card numbers, usernames and passwords for internet banking platforms, personal data of the victim, etc.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 148)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>TOR (The Onion Router)</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'One of the best known tools with which to achieve a good anonymization is TOR (The Onion Router), which is a network of computers (nodes) that distributes the transactions over several places on the Internet, so that it is almost impossible from one single node to trace the user.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 148)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud computing</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'Cloud computing’ means that data—and thus also electronic evidence—is less held on a specific device or in closed networks but is distributed over different services, providers, locations and often jurisdictions.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 155)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ransomware</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'Ransomware is software able to restrict the access to a computer system and its content until a ransom is paid. Usually the ransomware encrypts the whole disk drive of the computer and show a message containing the procedure to pay the ransom and obtain the decrypting key.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 154)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service)</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'A distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack is an attack where multiple compromised servers are used to target a single system flooding it with many fake requests, with the result that the server becomes inaccessible for the legitimate users and the service is taken down.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 152)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Defacement</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  'A defacement is an attack aimed to change the content of a webpage without the consent of the owner of the webpage. This type of attack is often used to cause reputational damages to companies or to spread political or other propaganda.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 152)\r\n</blockquote>"

This complicates the effective prosecution of crimes that are inherently without borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'While cybercrime is a phenomenon without borders, the effective prosecution of such a crime is seriously hampered by conflicts of territoriality and jurisdiction.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 147)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The effective prosecution of cybercrime is seriously hampered by the “loss of location” problem, which complicates the collection of electronic evidence.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 147)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cloud Computing Exacerbates Evidence Collection Issues</h3>\r\n<p>The evolution of technology, particularly cloud computing, has created significant challenges in the collection and jurisdiction of electronic evidence, which is crucial for prosecuting cybercrimes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'These problems are exacerbated by the evolution of information technology, in particular cloud computing which creates ‘loss of location’ problems for collecting the electronic evidence indispensable for prosecuting crime.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 147)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The non-localised nature of cloud computing causes problems for live forensics (online forensics) and searches because of the architecture of the cloud.' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 158)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proposals for Improved Jurisdictional Frameworks</h3>\r\n<p>The Cloud Evidence Group, established by the Cybercrime Convention Committee, proposed a series of measures to address these jurisdictional challenges, emphasizing the need for international cooperation and flexible legal frameworks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The Cloud Evidence Group—a Working Group established by decision of the Cybercrime Convention Committee—has proposed, within the limits of agreed legal principles of territoriality and jurisdiction, a series of measures which, together with proper implementation of the Convention, would enable fast and effective access to electronic evidence.'

The reliance on mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and other traditional mechanisms may not be sufficient for the unique challenges presented by cybercrime and digital evidence across borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"mutual legal assistance procedures are considered too complex, lengthy and resource intensive, and thus too inefficient\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 161)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"the MLA process needs to be made more efficient in view of the scale of requests concerning electronic evidence and the volatility of such evidence.\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 161)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reliance on Voluntary Provider Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>The effectiveness of the current framework heavily relies on the voluntary cooperation of service providers, particularly those based in the US. This dependency could lead to inconsistencies in data access and may impact the integrity of investigations due to changes in provider policies or the lack of compulsion for providers to cooperate.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"providers tend to notify customers of such requests and this compromises investigations.\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 163)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Providers also frequently change their policies and procedures for data request, which makes co-operation volatile and unpredictable.\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 163)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inadequacies in Addressing Data Localization Challenges</h3>\r\n<p>The document highlights that current international legal instruments do not adequately address the challenges of data localization, which complicates the determination of jurisdiction and applicable law for data stored in cloud environments. This results in significant legal uncertainty and may hinder effective law enforcement.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"In short, the Cloud Evidence Group identified these questions: What governs jurisdiction to enforce for criminal justice purposes: Location of data? Nationality of owner of data? Location of owner of data?\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 158)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"It is unclear which legal regime applies and it is far from clear which rules apply for lawful access by criminal justice authorities.\" (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 158)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Underestimation of Technological Advancements</h3>\r\n<p>The document does not fully account for the rapid pace of technological advancements and their impact on cybercrime and cyber investigations.

(Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Internet has no standard provisions for tracking or tracing. A sophisticated user can modify information in IP packets and, in particular, forge the source addresses of packets.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Legal and Political Challenges in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>This topic addresses the dual challenge of aligning cyber attribution with both legal frameworks and international politics, highlighting the complications that arise from differing international laws and political wills.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Attribution to an ultimately responsible party also implicates to a very large degree legal, policy, and political questions.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The difficulty of attribution... impacts how states interact on the international stage, reflecting both on the strategic deployment of attribution in policy and the challenges of creating a cooperative international legal framework.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technical Forensics in Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n<p>Focuses on the role of technical forensics in the attribution process, which includes the analysis of data packets, IP addresses, and other digital traces that can potentially link a cyber action to its source.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'A sophisticated user can modify information in IP packets and, in particular, forge the source addresses of packets, making the technical forensics both crucial and complicated.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Electrons don’t wear uniforms’—there’s no inherent binding of any given IT activity to specific actors, which highlights the challenges faced by forensic experts.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Role of International Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>Discusses the significance and the need for international cooperation in developing standards and practices for effective and consistent attribution of cyberattacks to foster global cybersecurity.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'There is a growing consensus on the need for robust international frameworks that standardize the process of cyberattack attribution to enhance transparency and accountability among states.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'An internationally recognised rule should require states to include sufficient evidence in political attributions to make them open to criticism or corroboration.' (Lin, 2016)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Impact of Cyber Attribution on International Relations</h3>\r\n<p>Highlights how the process of attributing cyber incidents can affect international relations, potentially leading to conflicts or cooperation depending on how states choose to disclose or conceal their activities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The ability of a state to effectively attribute cyber incidents to another state and the international community's reaction to such attributions can significantly impact diplomatic relations.'

However, these challenges are particularly evident in the cyber context, where identifying who is behind a cyber operation presents significant technical problems.' (Shrivastava, 2022, p. 234)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers to do your dirty work.'

In Corfu Channel Merits (1949), the ICJ encouraged \"liberal recourse\" to the circumstantial evidence presented by the United Kingdom in proving Albania’s knowledge of the presence of mines in its waters.'

In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is, primarily, a normative issue.' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 437)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: If causality can be established in cyber operations, then attribution to a state actor becomes feasible under international law.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The relevant normative criteria include instances in which the person, group, or entity is a State organ, and where the person, group, or entity has been empowered with governmental authority by the State.' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 437)</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: State actors can control or direct cyber operations without direct involvement, complicating the attribution process.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'In particular, efforts to attribute private conduct to States through the effective control test face difficult factual challenges since in the cyber context a party must demonstrate that the State exercised effective control over the operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 437)</blockquote><h4>Question 2: How do the evidentiary challenges in cyberspace affect the ability of states to apply and enforce international law norms?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Due to the speed, anonymity, and ever-growing deceptive practices of cyber operations, the identification of the actor who launched a cyber operation poses a multitude of causality problems. Today, it is simple to hide one’s tracks and traces of actions in the Internet and, as a further complication, conceal one’s identity.' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 438)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: The greater the evidentiary challenges in attributing cyber operations, the less likely international law norms can be effectively enforced.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Similar problems arise with regard to the facts necessary to establish the factual prerequisites of attribution of private conduct to a State under all three tests. As Banks notes, \"state and non-state cyber threats now often blend and merge, as privateers operate as surrogates for states and provide cover for state-based actors.\"' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 439)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: State actors utilize non-state actors to carry out cyber operations, thus complicating the attribution process and the enforcement of international law.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'In particular, States may use proxies, defined here as \"non-state actors with comparatively loose ties to governments,\" to commit malicious cyber operations without acting under the effective control, specific direction, or instructions of the government.' (Dederer and Singer, 2019, p. 439)</blockquote>"

The assertion is made that these are inherently 'unsuitable for judicial determination,' and that the evidence produced in connection with them is intrinsically unmanageable or inappropriate for the Court's consideration.\" (Highet, 1987, p. 43)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  \"The question seems to boil down to the proposition that fluid or ongoing situations are unsuitable for adjudication since their factual matrix is fluid and constantly changing.\" (Highet, 1987, p. 43)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges Due to Non-Appearance of Parties</h3>\r\n<p>The non-appearance of parties in legal proceedings presents a significant limitation by forcing the court to rely on the evidence presented unilaterally by the appearing party. This can lead to an imbalance in the evaluation of the case and potentially affect the fairness of the judgment.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  \"One of the key problems presented by non-appearance (or nonparticipation, which is for these purposes functionally the same) is the paradox that evidence or near-evidence is taken into account by the Court that it might have ignored in a normal case, on the ground that the Court is obliged under Article 53 to satisfy itself that the claim of the applicant state is 'well founded in fact as well as in law.'\" (Highet, 1987, p. 45)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  \"In the course of attempting to determine the 'well-foundedness' of factual assertions, the Court must necessarily make particular and deliberate efforts to consider any factual elements accessible to it even if, in a normal setting, such evidence would have been unacceptable (if not out of order) as being inconsistent with the Court's own rules.\" (Highet, 1987, p. 45)\r\n</blockquote>"

This principle is critically analyzed in the context of U.S. and Nicaraguan interactions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It contains fresh and doubtless controversial interpretations of the principle of non-intervention.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The question of non-intervention involves the determination of when a state action becomes intervention in another state's sovereign affairs and the rights of the states under international law to protect their sovereignty.' (Highet, 1987, p. 3)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use of Force and Collective Self-Defense:</h3>\r\n<p>This topic discusses the conditions under which a state can lawfully use force and engage in collective self-defense under international law, with a focus on the implications for U.S. actions during the Nicaragua conflict.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It presents seminal findings on the use of force and the exercise of the inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The right to self-defense must be manifest and the response must be proportional to the armed attack that occurred, principles not observed in the presented situation.' (Highet, 1987, p. 4)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evidentiary Challenges in International Courts:</h3>\r\n<p>Explores how international courts face unique challenges in collecting and verifying evidence, especially in complex international disputes such as the Nicaragua case.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Evidentiary difficulties are significantly enhanced in situations where one of the parties does not participate, affecting the court's ability to ascertain the truth.' (Highet, 1987, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The Court has to rely heavily on the evidence presented by one side, which may lead to judgments based on incomplete facts.' (Highet, 1987, p. 22)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Legal Implications of Non-Appearance in Court Proceedings:</h3>\r\n<p>Addresses the consequences and legal doctrine regarding the non-appearance of parties in court proceedings, particularly how it impacts the judicial process and decision making.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The non-appearance of the United States made the job of the Court virtually impossible from a factual point of view.' (Highet, 1987, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Such non-participation cannot, in any circumstances, affect the validity of the Court's judgment.' (Highet, 1987, p. 23)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Customary International Law vs. Treaty Law:</h3>\r\n<p>This topic delves into the interaction and conflicts between customary international law and treaty law, with specific reference to the multilateral treaty reservations such as the Vandenberg Amendment.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Provocative reasoning about the genesis and maintenance of rules of customary international law, separate from treaties such as the United Nations Charter.' (Highet, 1987, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'The case discusses the legal ramifications of multilateral treaty reservations and their impact on the interpretation of international obligations.' (Highet, 1987, p. 4)</blockquote>"
