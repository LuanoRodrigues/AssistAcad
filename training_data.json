XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p.

This paper distinguishes between attribution of malicious cyber activity to a machine, to a specific perpetrator (often a human being pressing the keys) initiating that activity, and to an adversary that is deemed ultimately responsible for that activity.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 76)</blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Confidence in Attribution</h4>\r\n  <blockquote>“An attribution judgment is a statement with an inherent degree of uncertainty. Different professions use different sets of words to convey such uncertainty.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 111)</blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Standard of Proof</h4>\r\n  <blockquote>“The relevant standard of evidence that the judge or jury applies depends on the nature of the case. If the event in question is a criminal matter, the judge or jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt about the party responsible, whereas in a civil matter the judge or jury need only be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 112)</blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Adverse Cyber Operation</h4>\r\n  <blockquote>“A 'determination' is rarely definitive. God may know who 'really' did it, but our determinations of who did it will be associated with some degree of uncertainty—and it is very hard to be 100 percent confident about a determination.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 111)</blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Active Defense</h4>\r\n  <blockquote>“Appropriate responses are a central element of deterrence, but what makes a response appropriate? U.S. Strategic Command identifies three important factors for achieving deterrent effects; one was mentioned above, and the other two factors are credibility of a threat to impose costs on the adversary and costs that the adversary regards as too painful to incur.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 123)</blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Due Diligence</h4>\r\n  <blockquote>“Delays in attribution may implicate international law as well. An extended period of time passing after an intrusion likely weakens the case for forceful responsive actions to be regarded as legitimately acting in self-defense, since actions taken in self-defense are supposed to be only the minimum necessary to restore the status quo.” (H Lin, 2016, p. 124)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Attribution Complexity:</strong>\r\n      <p>The document highlights the multifaceted nature of attribution in cybersecurity, emphasizing that no single method or source of information can definitively attribute cyber activities. Instead, a comprehensive approach, integrating technical, political, legal, and policy dimensions, is necessary to paint a convincing picture of the perpetrator.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>'Attribution is an all-source issue—no one method or source of information can be used to point fingers, but multiple sources taken as a whole may paint a convincing picture.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 105)</blockquote>\r\n      <blockquote>'The all-source intelligence process seeks to approximate the God’s-eye understanding of an intrusion, whereas the discussions in earlier sections are legal and policy discussions.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 105)</blockquote>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>2. Advancements in Attribution:</strong>\r\n      <p>The document acknowledges significant advancements in the field of attribution over the years, driven by increased attention and investments in cybersecurity. These advancements have improved the ability to trace and attribute cyber activities, though with inherent uncertainties.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>'One important reason for the improvement in capabilities for attribution over the past several years is that as the importance of cybersecurity has grown, more people are paying attention.'

Adversary's Perspective:</strong>\r\n      <p>The findings also delve into the adversary's perspective on attribution, noting that adversaries may intentionally use sloppy tradecraft to signal capabilities, or adapt their techniques to avoid future attribution, making the attribution process more challenging.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>'An adversary may conduct an intrusion and deliberately engage in sloppy tradecraft to signal to the victim that it has the ability to conduct such an intrusion.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 126)</blockquote>\r\n      <blockquote>'The adversary’s techniques, tactics, and procedures may be adaptive to the defense’s actions.'

Role of Private Sector in Attribution:</strong>\r\n      <p>The document discusses the growing role of the private sector in attribution, highlighting both the advantages, such as unclassified reporting and high technical access, and disadvantages, such as potential bias and lack of independent oversight.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>'Private-sector involvement in attribution has advantages and disadvantages.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 108)</blockquote>\r\n      <blockquote>'Additional resources will be necessary as the volume of hostile cyber operations conducted by parties with advanced cyber capabilities increases.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 109)</blockquote>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>5. Political Challenges of Attribution:</strong>\r\n      <p>The findings underscore the political challenges inherent in attribution, particularly the difficulty in achieving a definitive \"determination\" and the varying degrees of confidence associated with attribution judgments.</p>\r\n      <blockquote>'A \"determination\" is rarely definitive... but our determinations of who did it will be associated with some degree of uncertainty.' (H Lin, 2016, p. 111)</blockquote>\r\n      <blockquote>'Policymakers are accustomed to making decisions about what to do or not to do under conditions of uncertainty—this is the reality of their daily lives.'

It highlights how laws are designed to ascertain responsibility for actions, particularly those that lead to harm or conflict. This legal foundation for attribution is crucial in both the physical world and cyberspace, emphasizing the importance of identifying responsible parties to administer justice or respond to hostile actions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Concerns about responsibility for actions or for events are embedded in domestic law. A person is found on the street with a bullet through his head, and we want to know who fired the shot.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'International law is concerned with questions of responsibility as well, especially as it relates to matters involving conflict.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - The Complexity of Attribution in Cyberspace</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph delves into the complexities of attribution in the cyber domain, noting the unique challenges posed by technical and historical factors. It suggests that while concerns of responsibility mirror those in the physical world, the digital landscape introduces distinct challenges in determining the actors behind malicious cyber activities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Similar concerns about responsibility are also present in cyberspace, but just how they play out is often quite different, for reasons both technical and historical.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Implications of Unresolved Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>The fifth paragraph discusses the practical implications of failing to resolve the question of attribution in cyber incidents. It emphasizes the difficulty in mitigating ongoing harm, punishing responsible parties, and deterring future malicious activities without clear attribution, illustrating the critical need for effective attribution mechanisms in cybersecurity.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'If this question cannot be answered, it may be hard for victims to mitigate ongoing harm; to do so would require the victim to be able to quickly and correctly identify the instrument or mechanism causing the harm and find a way to stop its malicious activities.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

This multifaceted understanding of responsibility is essential for comprehending the nuances of attribution in cyber incidents.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Ascertaining responsibility for malicious cyber activity can be understood in a variety of different ways because the term \"responsibility\" has a number of possible meanings, any or all of which may (or may not) be relevant in any given situation.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-4 - Three Meanings of Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>In these paragraphs, the text presents a hypothetical scenario involving a cyber attack to illustrate the three distinct meanings of attribution: attribution to a machine or set of machines, to a party whose conduct initiated the intrusion, and to an ultimately responsible or accountable party. This differentiation helps clarify the objectives behind attribution efforts, whether it's identifying the immediate source of an attack, the individual perpetrator, or the entity ultimately responsible.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'In principle, such a question can be answered in three ways, which are not mutually exclusive. The possible types of answers are a machine (or set of machines), a party whose conduct or behavior set the intrusion into motion (often a specific human being), and an ultimately responsible or accountable party.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - Challenges in Determining \"Real\" Responsibility</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph highlights the inherent challenges in distinguishing between malicious, deliberate behavior and accidental, errant behavior.

It clarifies that depending on the decision-maker's objective, attribution might target the machine directly involved, the individual initiating the activity, or the entity ultimately responsible for the cyber incident. This differentiation is crucial for formulating an appropriate response to cyber threats.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The section on the meaning of attribution began with a specific scenario... then what is most relevant is machine attribution: to find the machine causing the pain as quickly as possible and to take action against it.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Contextual and Technical Clues in Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs delve into how identifying the machine from which an intrusion originates can provide insights that might lead to identifying the perpetrator, and possibly the entity ultimately responsible for the cyber activity. The passage highlights the interconnectedness of these aspects of attribution, demonstrating that while they are conceptually distinct, they often relate in practice. Technical forensics, such as analyzing keyboard language settings or access capabilities, play a pivotal role in this process.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'For example, if the machine originating an intrusion is definitively located in Nation A, it suggests that the perpetrator has access to machines in Nation A.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'It may also be the case that responsibility cannot be allocated cleanly to a specific party...

This connection is crucial for identifying not only the direct perpetrator but also the entity ultimately responsible for the cyber activity.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Knowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Considerations in Perpetrator Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs delve into the complexities of perpetrator attribution, discussing how geographical, technological, and organizational factors can influence the search for the perpetrator. It highlights the role of technical forensics, such as keyboard language settings, in providing hints about the perpetrator's possible nationality, and addresses the diffusion of responsibility in decentralized organizations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'For example, if the machine originating an intrusion is definitively located in Nation A, it suggests that the perpetrator has access to machines in Nation A.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'It may also be the case that responsibility cannot be allocated cleanly to a specific party... In such a situation, responsibility is diffused among the individuals involved in an unclear manner.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 4-5 - Case Study: APT1 Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>The text presents a detailed case study of APT1, showing how the attribution process can encompass not just the machines used in cyber espionage but also the human operators and the entities ultimately responsible. The discussion illustrates the multifaceted nature of attribution, involving technical evidence, human intelligence, and geopolitical considerations.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'In 2013, Mandiant released a report called “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” identifying a group it called “APT1” as a single organization of operators that conducted a cyber espionage campaign.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Mandiant used a variety of other information to associate these machines with Chinese actors... APT1 hackers also used a Remote Desktop client from Microsoft to manage their remote access to targeted systems.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It acknowledges that adversaries might not always seek to conceal their involvement in cyber intrusions. Instead, they might intentionally use sloppy techniques as a form of signaling their capabilities to deter actions from the victim nation that might be undesirable to them.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'But it is also necessary to consider the adversary’s perspective on attribution. For example, most discussions of attribution (including this one) assume that the adversary wishes to conceal its involvement in an intrusion.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Adaptive Tactics and Uncertainties Faced by Adversaries</h3>\r\n  <p>In paragraphs 2 and 3, the text discusses how adversaries may adapt their tactics based on the victim's defensive actions and the outcomes of previous intrusions. This adaptation includes changing tools and methods to avoid detection and complicate future attribution efforts. However, this also introduces uncertainties for the adversaries, as they cannot always predict the effectiveness of their concealment strategies, nor can they be entirely confident in remaining anonymous.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Assuming the adversary wishes to conceal its involvement in an intrusion, it is important to consider any given intrusion in a larger context.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Thus, if the adversary’s personnel make mistakes of tradecraft that give the victim enough information to attribute the intrusion publicly, they will try not to make those mistakes again.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Adversaries Seeking Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph explores the scenario where an adversary might want their cyber actions to be attributed to them, a contrast to the common assumption of adversaries wishing to remain concealed. It describes how an adversary could take explicit steps to ensure their actions are attributed to them, potentially to assert power or send political messages.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'If an adversary affirmatively wants its use of cyber weapons to be attributed to it for some reason, a somewhat different set of considerations applies.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It highlights how the Internet's structure and the simplicity of manipulating packet information complicate the process of tracing malicious activities back to their sources.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The difficulty of attribution is often held to be the result of the design of the Internet.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 3-4 - Beyond Technical Challenges</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs discuss how the challenges of attribution extend beyond mere technical aspects, touching on historical methods of cyber attacks and the relevance of packet-level attribution. The text underscores that while technical forensics play a significant role, they are not the sole factor in the complex process of attributing cyber incidents.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'These assertions about the Internet’s design are entirely true.

It emphasizes the all-source nature of attribution and the inherent uncertainties involved in the process.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'On one hand, attribution capabilities are increasing because more attention and resources are being devoted to the topic.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It clarifies that the use of force is generally prohibited except under certain conditions, such as self-defense against an armed attack, as per Articles 2(4), 42, and 51 of the Charter. This sets the foundation for understanding how states can legally respond to cyber hostilities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The legal framework for use of force by states is contained in the Charter of the United Nations, which generally prohibits states from using force against another state...'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'...Article 51 permits use of force in self-defense against an armed attack, stating that \"nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.\"' (Mejia, 2014)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 3-7 - Direct and Indirect State Attribution in Cyber Operations</h3>\r\n  <p>The document delves into the complexities of attributing cyber activities to states. It differentiates between direct attribution, where state actors are directly involved, and indirect attribution, which involves nonstate actors but could implicate a state if it fails to prevent such activities. This section highlights the difficulty of attribution in cyber operations and its implications for state responses.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Hostile cyber acts can be attributed to a state either directly or indirectly...'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'...Indirect Attribution. Acts or omissions of nonstate actors are generally not attributable to the state; however, the state may incur responsibility if it fails to exercise due diligence in preventing or reacting to such acts or omissions.' (Mejia, 2014)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - The Challenge of Conclusive Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph emphasizes the inherent challenges in conclusively attributing cyber acts to specific actors, given the technical and operational characteristics of cyberspace. It discusses the potential for adversaries to mask their identity and location, complicating the process of attribution and, by extension, the formulation of an appropriate response.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Both act and actor attribution are difficult to prove with scientific certainty. Computer networks are not designed to facilitate attribution, and hostile actors exploit this weakness to hide their true identity.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 9 - Legal Standards and Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>The text suggests applying legal standards traditionally used in courts, such as \"clear and convincing evidence\" and \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" to the process of cyber attribution. This approach acknowledges the inherent uncertainties in attribution while providing a structured framework for decision-making in response to cyber hostilities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Employing legal subjective criteria is not a new or novel idea. In a 2009 Microsoft white paper, the author suggested a similar subjective assessment for cyber attribution...'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 10-11 - An Analytic Model for Cyber Attribution</h3>\r\n  <p>The final section proposes an analytic model for cyber attribution that considers both the actor and the act. This model aims to determine the appropriate response and the responsible entity for addressing the cyber hostility, incorporating basic principles of the law of armed conflict (LOAC).</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'An assessment of these factors should indicate who should respond to an act of cyber hostility and what the upper range of appropriate responses should be...'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The use of a variety of evidence types, including films and complex maps, is highlighted, emphasizing the ICJ's challenges in adjudicating based on such evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'To this end, the parties produced extensive and hotly contested evidence relating to geomorphology, geology and geography. A film was produced by Tunisia and shown to the Court...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 2 - Sovereignty and Evidence Nonproduction</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph addresses the implications of sovereignty on evidence nonproduction, drawing from the Corfu Channel case to illustrate how the ICJ navigates situations where direct proof is unavailable due to a state's exclusive territorial control. The paragraph underlines the Court's reliance on circumstantial evidence and inferences in such scenarios.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'[T]he fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 3-4 - Inference and Factual Conclusions</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs delve into the ICJ's use of inference in drawing factual conclusions, especially in the absence of direct evidence. The discussion highlights how the Court may accept or reject claims based on the absence of denial or partial contradictions, illustrating this through examples from the Nicaragua case.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Traditionally, the Court has operated in important areas of factual conclusions by an informed process of inference...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'What is asserted, but only partially contradicted, may be found to be partially valid...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 5-7 - The Role of Documentary Evidence and Experts</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs discuss the predominant role of documentary evidence in the ICJ's fact-finding process, acknowledging the limited use of live witnesses and experts throughout the Court's history. The narrative underscores the Court's flexibility and ad hoc approach in assessing the admissibility and probative value of evidence, reflecting on the procedural evolution from the Court's inception.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The great majority of issues of fact presented to the Court since 1922 has been capable of resolution principally by pleading and documentary proof...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Witnesses and Experts... There have only been eight cases in 60 years in which live witnesses and experts of the parties have appeared before the Court...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 8 - Conclusion on Documentary Evidence Reliability</h3>\r\n  <p>The final paragraph reiterates the Court's cautious approach towards documentary evidence, particularly from unilateral sources. It reflects on the Court's methodology in treating such evidence as illustrative rather than definitive, especially in complex cases where the party providing the evidence is not present to validate it.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'A large number of documents have been supplied in the form of reports in press articles, and some also in the form of extracts from books...'

The effort put into evidence production and its ultimate inconclusiveness in certain cases highlight the challenges faced by the ICJ in evidence assessment.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'To this end, the parties produced extensive and hotly contested evidence relating to geomorphology, geology and geography... the Court essentially found no convincing evidence militating in either direction...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 2 - Evidentiary Diversity and Judicial Discretion</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph continues the discussion on the variety of evidence presented to the ICJ, illustrating the Court's broad discretion in handling such evidence, as seen in cases like the Gulf of Maine and Libya/Malta. The emphasis is on the Court's decision-making process, which often relies on geographical solutions and disregards conflicting technical evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'In the Gulf of Maine case, a great deal of documentary evidence was again laid before the Chamber... However, the Chamber did not find that any of this technical evidence was relevant or determinative...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - Customary Law and Evidentiary Relevance</h3>\r\n  <p>The focus shifts to how the principles of customary law, particularly as articulated in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, influenced the ICJ's handling of evidence in the Libya/Malta case. The paragraph discusses the Court's preference for geographical solutions over complex geological arguments, demonstrating the evolving nature of evidentiary relevance in light of international law.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'By the time the Court came to consider the Libya/ Malta case, the principles of customary law largely expressed in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea became in large measure the law of the case...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Maps as Documentary Evidence</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph delves into the role of maps as documentary evidence in territorial disputes and boundary claims before the ICJ. It highlights the significance of cartographic evidence in cases like the Temple of Preah Vihear, demonstrating the Court's reliance on maps to infer contemporaneous intentions and state actions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'As an important aspect of documentary evidence, maps have in general played a key role in litigation before the Court...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 5 - The Evolving Role of Technical and Scientific Evidence</h3>\r\n  <p>The discussion turns to the changing role of technical and scientific evidence in ICJ proceedings, as illustrated by the Tunisia/Libya and subsequent cases. The paragraph reflects on the ICJ's approach to complex scientific claims and the varying degrees of evidentiary weight afforded to such claims based on the legal framework and factual context of each case.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'In Tunisia/ Libya the Court heard a variety of speeches by technical members of each side's delegation, and the testimony of one actual expert, a geomorphologist...'

The author reflects on the potential threats such a strategy poses to the ICJ's authority and functionality, as well as the possible backlash against the non-appearing party for undermining the court's legitimacy.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The Nicaragua case dramatizes the profound consequences and implications of the nonappearance...This can become a life-threatening event for a fragile institution such as the Court.'

The author suggests that the adversity may lead to strengthening the court's role in international law through the realization of reforms and increased factual determinations required by such cases.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'It is therefore not entirely vain naivete to hope that some institutional good may come out of the extraordinarily difficult situation from which the Court is just now emerging.'

The emphasis is on how such non-appearance forces the ICJ to rely more heavily on its own investigative capabilities and theoretical justifications in the absence of counterarguments from the non-appearing party.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'With the announcement of its withdrawal, the United States made the job of the Court virtually impossible from a factual point of view...' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Evaluating the 'No-Appearance' Strategy</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph evaluates the 'no-appearance' strategy from a strategic perspective, contemplating its potential backfires and the Court's need to adapt by formulating new rules of evidence and making legal interpretations in the absence of one party's arguments.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Rules of evidence were formulated that would clearly not have been necessary had the United States been in the courtroom to defend itself...'

Despite criticisms of the award's legal bases, the U.S. complied, showcasing a commitment to respecting arbitral decisions and international law.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'...Secretary Hughes was highly critical of the award and refused to accept that its bases of decision were declaratory of international law or capable of creating precedents binding on the United States. The check was nevertheless delivered, as a \"tangible proof of [the] desire [of the U.S. Government] to respect arbitral awards\" and of its \"devotion to the principle of arbitral settlements even in the face of a decision proclaiming certain theories of law which it cannot accept.\"' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 2 - Negative and Positive Consequences of Non-Appearance</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph examines the dual consequences of the 'no-appearance technique' used by the United States in the Nicaragua case. It highlights the potential threat to the ICJ's authority and the paradoxical possibility that such challenges might strengthen the court through legal and procedural reforms.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The \"no-appearance technique\" of litigation... may suffer a setback, once its absurdity and overall uselessness are correctly perceived. Likewise, overt defiance of the Court by a great power over a case won by a small one may prove to be an unattractive example-a disincentive-for other states.' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 3 - Long-Term Implications for the ICJ and International Law</h3>\r\n  <p>The discussion extends to the long-term implications for the ICJ and the development of international law, suggesting that the challenges posed by non-appearance might lead to a stronger, more effective Court. It reflects on the potential for the Court's role in international law to evolve positively in response to such adversities.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'...the negative forces undermining the progressive development of international law-nonproduction, noncooperation, and nonappearance... will now be seen for what they are.' (Keith Highet, 1987)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - The Optimistic Outlook for Institutional Strengthening</h3>\r\n  <p>The final paragraph offers an optimistic outlook on the future of the ICJ, suggesting that despite the challenges, the Court could emerge stronger and more relevant. It invokes Pascal's wager to argue that believing in the Court's potential for effective functioning is a worthwhile bet.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'It is therefore not entirely vain naivete to hope that some institutional good may come out of the extraordinarily difficult situation from which the Court is just now emerging.'
