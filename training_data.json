The main conclusions emphasize the need for standardized evidence procedures to increase the credibility and trust in political attributions of cyberattacks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations. More substantiated attributions could lead to a better understanding of cyberattacks and increase trust.'

(Burleson et al., 2022, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Although it provides a net benefit in tracing illicit financial activity, transaction transparency makes users of blockchain technologies particularly vulnerable to fraud, social engineering, and theft of assets by bad actors.'

For each key term and definition found: - Use `<h3>` tags for the key term. - Use `<blockquote>` tags for quoting the definition exactly as it appears, including the exact citation format. **Example of output format**: ```html <h3>[Key Term]</h3> <blockquote> [Direct definition by the author exactly as found, including citations] </blockquote> ``` This format should be strictly respected and used for each definition found.Take your time, review the final output for accuracy and consistency in HTML formatting and citation-context alignment.\n\nnote1:output format:html in a code block."

The value of evidence law depends on the extent to which the truth can be revealed in the trial. When it comes to ‘blockchain evidence’, its evidentiary value should also depend on whether this type of evidence can effectively enhance the accuracy of fact-finding.'

However, this approach seems to weaken the relevance of the evidence.' (Su, 2024)</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Blockchain evidence is limited by its 'closed-loop authenticity' which might affect its function in proving the relevance of evidence.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Blockchain evidence is limited by its ‘closed-loop authenticity’, which in turn diminishes its function in proving the relevance of evidence, leading the challenging party and the authenticating party both into the trap of its ‘self-authenticating’.'

Evidentiary standards help ensure that attributions are perceived as more objective and reliable.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'More substantiated attributions could lead to a better understanding of cyberattacks and increase trust.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lack of Standardized Evidentiary Practices Across States</h3>\r\n<p>The study highlights that there is no standardized practice across states regarding the provision of evidence when attributing cyberattacks. This lack of uniformity can lead to inconsistencies and disputes concerning the legitimacy of attributions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The current practice of political attribution is not standardized across countries. States can decide if they want to publicly provide evidence when attributing responsibility, how much evidence will be given, and what form such attribution will take.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It is noteworthy that joint attributions by a coalition of states have demonstrated to be particularly effective, especially due to an added degree of legitimacy.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>International Law's Ambiguous Role in Attribution Standards</h3>\r\n<p>The document discusses how international law currently lacks clarity regarding the standards of evidence necessary for attributing cyberattacks, which contributes to the variability and unpredictability in state responses.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Currently, States tend to avoid invoking international law when making political attributions of cyberattacks. This suggests that the law is weak – or worse, irrelevant – in holding states accountable for their cyber operations.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'International law is unclear regarding the standard of evidence that states must follow when accusing others of internationally wrongful acts.' (Blauth & Gstrein, 2021)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages of Regulating Evidentiary Standards</h3>\r\n<p>Regulating evidentiary standards internationally could standardize the process of attributing cyberattacks, thus providing a more structured and universally acceptable framework that enhances the validity and acceptance of such attributions globally.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Establishing legal requirements will certainly make the process of attribution more complex. At the same time, substantiated public attributions would be more credible and it is likely that they would also provoke stronger political effects.'

It highlights the vulnerability this creates, making these systems prime targets for hackers, potentially leading to extensive damages.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Individuals, private organisations, and the public sector are increasingly reliant on digital technologies and infrastructures to function.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Importance of attribution in cyberattacks</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph discusses the critical role of attributing cyberattacks in determining responsibility and preventing future attacks. It explains the multifaceted nature of attribution, involving technical, legal, and political aspects.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'In this context, the attribution of a cyberattack is critical, considering its purpose of assigning responsibility for conducting a cyberattack.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 3,4 - Challenges and necessity of credible political attributions</h3>\r\n    <p>The discussion extends into the complications and significance of political attributions in cyberattacks. It emphasizes how such attributions must be credible and backed by evidence to effectively deter future cyber misconduct and uphold international norms.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Political cyberattack attributions, which are increasingly common, are critical to maintain strategic stability through deterrence and escalation control.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'However, such attributions might suffer from a lack of credibility if they are not accompanied by sufficient evidence.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - The role of evidentiary standards</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph argues for the establishment of evidentiary standards to make political attributions of cyberattacks more trustworthy. It touches on the delicate balance of revealing sources and methods, which could be detrimental to state security.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 6,7 - Advancing the discourse on evidentiary standards</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs delve into the broader scholarly and institutional discourse advocating for enhanced procedural and substantive elements in the public attribution of cyberattacks. It hints at a shift towards the development of guidelines for evidentiary standards.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The process of attribution, including the procedural and substantive elements, has been widely debated.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'It has also been argued that the focus of this discussion should shift towards the development of evidentiary standard guidelines.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence defined digital evidence as \"any information of probative value that is either stored or transmitted in a digital form.\" This definition suggests that digital evidence includes information stored on a computer, passing through a computer, or extracted from a computer.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Volatile Evidence</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    'Volatile evidence is any data that is stored in memory or exists in transit that requires constant power to maintain its existence. Volatile data is lost when a computer loses power or is turned off. It may be contrasted with non-volatile memory or \"persistent data\" which is stored on a hard drive, or another medium such as on floppy discs, and is preserved even after the computer is shut down.'

It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"These characteristics of digital evidence raise issues as to its reliability.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>International Law Enforcement Cooperation</h3>\r\n<p>The document discusses the complications in international law enforcement cooperation due to jurisdictional boundaries, the varying capacities of countries to tackle cybercrimes, and the need for harmonization of legal procedures across borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 246)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Role of ISPs in Cybercrime Investigation</h3>\r\n<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a crucial role in cybercrime investigations. The study explores how ISPs can assist in tracing cyber attacks and preserving digital evidence, while also highlighting the challenges related to data retention and privacy concerns.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"ISPs generate log files in relation to each of these services, such as details of emails held on the ISP’s mail server computers.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"When a cyber attack occurs, preservation orders should be sought against ISPs who may have relevant evidence.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 244)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Legal and Ethical Issues in Digital Forensics</h3>\r\n<p>This topic delves into the ethical and legal considerations that digital forensic experts face while collecting and analyzing digital evidence, especially concerning the privacy of individuals and the authenticity of the digital artifacts.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Digital objects bear less evidence of authorship, provenance, originality, and other commonly accepted attributes than do analog objects. The former are subject to additional suspicion.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 242)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Tests must be devised and administered to authenticate them.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 242)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Trends in Cybercrime and Security</h3>\r\n<p>The document outlines expected future trends in cybercrime activities and the necessary advancements in cybersecurity measures. It stresses the importance of ongoing research and technological advancement to stay ahead of cybercriminals.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The character of hacking has changed. It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"There is evidence that organised crime has recruited hackers to exploit weaknesses in IT security.\" (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>"

It is ephemeral in nature and susceptible to manipulation. These characteristics of digital evidence raise issues as to its reliability.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 1: If digital evidence handling and forensic procedures are standardized and improved, then the reliability of digital evidence in legal contexts will increase.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'There is an absence of generally recognised standards of best practice in digital evidence forensic procedures, and a lack of adequate training of forensic examiners.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 1: Digital evidence requires specialized handling and preservation techniques to maintain its integrity and admissibility in court.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'...altering (inserting, modifying or deleting) digital records is so easy that it may happen accidentally... In contrast, analog technology makes alteration of analog records relatively expensive, and requires more skill and intent than changing digital records.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote><h4>Question 2: How does the international dimension of cyber crime complicate the investigation and prosecution processes?</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hypotheses</h3>\r\n<h4>Hypothesis 2: Enhancing international cooperation and harmonizing cybercrime laws will improve the effectiveness of cyber crime investigations and prosecutions.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The most important international initiative in this area is the Council of Europe’s Convention of Cybercrime, which was signed in 2001 and entered into force in July 2004.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Assumption 2: International jurisdictions share a common interest in combatting cybercrime, which facilitates cooperation despite differing national laws.</h4>\r\n<blockquote>'The traditional model of co-operation was slow, bureaucratic, and riddled with diplomatic restrictions. It was not geared towards the rapid tracing of data in real time or live mode.' (Chaikin, 2006)</blockquote>"

This shift has also seen a move from broad, less targeted attacks to highly sophisticated and targeted methods aiming to exploit specific vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Surveys from the private IT security industry and law enforcement indicate that the character of hacking has changed. It is now dominated by criminal attackers who are more focused on profits, less risk averse and more socially dangerous.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead of using brute force attacks to overcome computer security, criminals are relying on targeted, stealthy and sophisticated scanning.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 239)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Utilization of Bot Networks in Cyber Crimes</h3>\r\n<p>The study reveals an increasing utilization of bot networks by cyber criminals to conduct various malicious activities, including spam distribution, click fraud, and even for ransom or extortion purposes, thereby presenting new challenges for cyber security and law enforcement.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'There is the insidious phenomenon of bot network which consists of a group of computers controlled by third parties without the consent of the owner of the computer.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Profit-seeking criminals have relied on bot networks for sending phishing emails/spam, engaging in \"click fraud,\" and/or for the purpose of blackmail/extortion.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 240)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenges in International Cyber Crime Investigations</h3>\r\n<p>The research discusses the complexities of dealing with cyber crimes that involve multiple jurisdictions, highlighting the difficulties in cooperation and legal harmonization which significantly impede effective investigation and prosecution of international cyber crimes.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Network investigations with an international element must deal with problems of jurisdiction and sovereignty, and a lack of harmonisation of substantive and procedural national criminal laws.' (Chaikin, 2006, p. 241)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Criminals exploit the Internet and other network communications which are international in scope. They launch cyber attacks from foreign countries, conceal evidence of their crimes in foreign locations, and take advantage of the weaknesses in international law enforcement co-operation.'

Secretary-General, then, the ambiguities of cyberspace “simply reflect the challenges ... that already exists [sic] in many contexts.”3 It is undeniable, however, that these challenges are particularly evident in the cyber context, where identifying who is behind a cyber operation presents significant technical problems.4 As has been effectively observed, “the Internet is one big masquerade ball.
