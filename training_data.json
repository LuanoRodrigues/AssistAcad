The practical use of the Cloud Evidence Group's recommendations could streamline processes such as mutual legal assistance, enhancing the effectiveness of international cooperation and evidence gathering in cloud environments. This directly impacts law enforcement agencies and legal practitioners who deal with cybercrime, providing them with a more robust framework for accessing electronic evidence stored across different jurisdictions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The Cloud Evidence Group identified these questions: What governs jurisdiction to enforce for criminal justice purposes: Location of data? Nationality of owner of data? Location of owner of data? Nationality of data owner? Location of data controller? Headquarters of a cloud service provider? Subsidiary of a cloud service provider? Territory where a cloud provider is offering its services? Laws of the territory where the data owner has subscribed to a service? The territory of the criminal justice authority?' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 159).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Theoretical Contributions</h3>\r\n<p>The study contributes theoretically by expanding the discussion on the principle of territoriality in the context of cybercrime. It challenges traditional concepts by introducing the complexities brought by cloud computing and suggests that the existing territorial approaches to jurisdiction may be inadequate for the digital age. This contribution is crucial for academic and legal frameworks as it prompts a reevaluation of how legal principles are applied in cyberspace.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'To address this question, in December 2014 the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY)–the entity representing the Parties to the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime–established a Cloud Evidence Working Group (CEG) which was tasked with identifying solutions by the end of 2016' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 150).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The document outlines several policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of legal frameworks in combating cybercrime. These include establishing clearer guidelines for transborder data access, and adapting legal definitions to encompass the distributed nature of cloud storage and services. Such changes are recommended to ensure that law enforcement agencies can legally and effectively access electronic evidence, irrespective of where the data is physically stored or the nationality of data controllers.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The crucial question to address is therefore which options are available to permit effective and lawful access to electronic evidence for criminal justice purposes?' (Kleijssen and Perri, 2017, p. 158).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The text highlights the support for multiple languages, which is crucial for operations in a multilingual environment like Hong Kong.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The first important feature of DESK is the search function. It is used to search for files on the subject machine that contain pre-defined search keywords. Pre-defined search keywords are words that are relevant to a particular crime case.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Types of Searches: Physical and Logical</h3>\r\n  <p>The description of search methods continues with an explanation of the physical and logical searches. Physical search examines each physical sector regardless of file system, which is beneficial for uncovering hidden or obfuscated data. Logical search, in contrast, uses the file system's structure to locate file sequences, allowing for more complex queries that span across multiple sectors.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Physical search performs a search of the patterns of each physical sector of the subject machine’s storage system.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Logical search makes use of the information about the file system. Conceptually, a file is a continuous sequence of bytes and the file system takes care of placing portions of the sequence into different sectors (not necessarily contiguous) while maintaining the logical contiguity of the contents of a file.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Deleted File Search</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph focuses on the deleted file search, which targets areas of the storage system that still contain data from files marked as deleted but not yet overwritten. This search type is critical for forensic investigations as it can recover data presumed lost or hidden through regular deletion processes.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The third kind of search is the deleted file search. In most file systems, file deletion is typically accomplished by modifying only a few bytes of the file system. The contents of a deleted file are still in the storage system provided that it has not been overwritten.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It describes the mathematical properties of hash functions and emphasizes their reliability in confirming the authenticity of digital evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'DESK provides a file system integrity checking function that enables users to examine the ‘fingerprints’ of the files. Technically, the ‘fingerprints’ are called hash values.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Properties of Hash Functions and Their Forensic Application</h3>\r\n  <p>The paragraphs continue to detail the specific properties of hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1, describing how these functions guarantee the uniqueness and tamper-proof nature of the hash values. The explanation aids in understanding how DESK uses these values to verify file integrity and to detect unauthorized changes or corruptions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'If a file F gives a hash value H1, then modifying F by a single bit will result in a totally different hash value H2.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'If a file F gives a hash value H1, and given another hash value H2 not equal to H1, it is computationally impossible to purposefully modify parts of F (such as modifying the last 10 bytes) such that the newly modified file will produce H2 as the hash value.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraph 4 - Practical Uses of Hash Functions in Forensics</h3>\r\n  <p>This paragraph outlines practical forensic applications of hash functions within DESK. It explains how hash values are used to detect altered files and to identify files within a large system, akin to matching human fingerprints, thereby providing a powerful tool for forensic analysts in the investigation of digital evidence.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'Another usage of the hash value is to check whether some standard files have been modified. One of the objectives of cyber crime investigation is to check whether criminal records are stored under the name of some popular software (e.g. ‘winzip.exe’).'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 5-6 - Enhanced Integrity Verification and Preventive Measures</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs discuss the extended capabilities of the DESK integrity checker, such as verifying the hash value of an entire hard disk. They also cover the strategy of using disk cloning to protect the integrity of the original evidence during forensic analysis. This approach minimizes the risk of data alteration during the investigative process.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'DESK provides the functionality of computing the hash value of the entire hard disk.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Hashing can be used to ensure that the copies are exact replicas of the original disks (both having identical hash values) and the results obtained from analyzing these copies should be identical to those performed on the actual disks.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The description includes the sequential use of DESK's search methods and hash value matching to determine the relevance of the information found on the subject machine for further forensic investigation.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'A typical usage of the DESK software begins with the preparation of the pattern file, which contains search keywords, and the hash value database. Next, the DESK machine is connected to the subject machine; the proper hardware token is then attached to the subject machine. The subject machine is then started up using the DESK floppy diskette.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Decision Making and Efficiency of DESK</h3>\r\n  <p>These paragraphs summarize the outcomes facilitated by the DESK system, which are pivotal in deciding whether a full-scale investigation is warranted based on the preliminary findings. It discusses the efficiency and effectiveness of DESK in speeding up the forensic process, which would otherwise involve seizing all suspect machines for lengthy inspections, thus aiding law enforcement in making quicker and more informed decisions.</p>\r\n  <blockquote>'The inspection process will usually consist of repeated applications of the three search methods (physical search, logical search, and deleted file search) and the matching of the hash values. The outcome of these operations will be one of the following: The subject machine contains some information that is considered to be of value for further investigation.'</blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>'Without the DESK software, or similar systems, law enforcement agents will have no choice but to seize all subject machines for lengthy inspections. The whole investigation process of cyber crimes will become very slow and expensive.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

Landscape studies, particularly influenced by Carl Sauer's concepts, help define the digital landscape as a cultural product shaped by various agents, reinforcing the study's narrative by constructing a sense of digital place. Communications geography and critical GIS provide a foundation for examining the internet and digital interactions as geospatial phenomena, emphasizing the socio-political dimensions of cyberspace.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Landscape studies in the United States began with a 1925 essay by Carl Sauer entitled, \"The Morphology of Landscape\"... The cultural landscape is fashioned out of a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result' (Pieschke, 2014, p. 8).</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Models</h3>\r\n    <p>The models used in the study involve applications of Panopticism to understand the dynamics of surveillance and privacy within the digital landscape, particularly in the context of internet policy and the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). This model helps analyze the power dynamics and control mechanisms embedded within digital interactions and legislative frameworks, which are crucial for understanding the political geography of digital policies.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Panopticism is a social theory... applied metaphorically to society by Michel Foucault, spurring a trend in surveillance scholarship known as Panopticism' (Pieschke, 2014, p. 23).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

On one side of the argument, governments would need to tighten control over information through heavy encryption to prevent security breaches and internet policies to protect users and intellectual property' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Internet users have responded to these attempts with online petitions and calls to representatives. On January 18, 2012, several websites, including Wikipedia, coordinated a \"blackout\" of the internet to show internet users what would be lost if legislation were to pass' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Voting Patterns and Geographic Disparities</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph analyzes the voting patterns on CISPA, showing how political geography reflects broader societal and demographic trends. It describes how support and opposition to CISPA varied geographically, with rural and urban differences evident in the congressional vote distribution.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'CISPA was designed to circumvent the fourth amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. According to Mike Roberts (R-MI), \"[W]hile much cybersecurity monitoring and threat information sharing takes place today within the private sector, real and perceived legal barriers substantially hamper the efforts of the private sector to protect itself\"' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 5 - Conclusion and Implications</h3>\r\n    <p>The final paragraph reflects on the broader implications of CISPA and similar legislation on the digital landscape. It underscores the ongoing debate between security and privacy, suggesting that the political geography of such laws is critical to understanding their potential impact on society.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'CISPA is still alive in Congress. It is waiting on approval from the Senate and the Executive Branch. If it fails to pass, the bill may be re-written until some form of it passes' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The increasing ease of data transfer and the consequent rise in copyright violations are highlighted as significant issues that necessitate legislative attention.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Several issues of concern come up when discussing the internet. How do some of the laws that formerly governed analog objects apply to digital objects? The internet, which is no longer in its infancy, faces many challenges when it comes to privacy and the protection of intellectual property' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Digital Rights and Legislative Responses</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs detail the historical context and legislative responses to the challenges posed by the digital age, specifically the evolution of copyright law and the introduction of legislation such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The discussion elaborates on how these laws aim to adapt traditional intellectual property protections to the digital environment.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'In 1969, the predecessor to the internet, ARPANET, was created to communicate research over long distances for the U.S. Department of Defense. It eventually evolved into the World Wide Web, which was introduced in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Since the explosion of the internet in the early 1990s, copyright violations have increased. Copyright law was originally intended to be a limited monopoly on creative works in order to give incentives for creators to produce new works' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA)</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph discusses the introduction and implications of CISPA, emphasizing its aim to allow for greater sharing of cyber threat intelligence between the private sector and the government. The potential privacy concerns and the controversial nature of the act are also noted, reflecting ongoing debates about the balance between security and privacy.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Jumping ahead, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) was first introduced during the 112th Congress as H.R. 3523 \"to provide for the sharing of certain cyber threat intelligence and cyber threat information between the intelligence community and cybersecurity entities\"' (Pieschke, 2014).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It poses the question of whether such activities constitute internationally wrongful acts, involving breaches of obligations under international law, and contemplates the need for attribution to a specific state.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'This Article examines remotely conducted election meddling by cyber means in the context of international law and asks whether such cyber operations qualify as \"internationally wrongful acts.\"' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Election Meddling as a Violation of International Law</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs delve into potential breaches of international law that could be implicated by state-sponsored cyber election meddling. Three main breaches are discussed: violation of the requirement to respect sovereignty, intervention into the internal affairs of another state, and the breach of due diligence obligation in preventing such operations from one's territory.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The Article considers three possible breaches related to such meddling—violation of the requirement to respect sovereignty, intervention into the internal affairs of another State, and, when the cyber operations are not attributable to the State from which they were launched, breach of the due diligence obligation that requires States to ensure cyber operations with serious adverse consequences are not mounted from their territory.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4-5 - Attribution and Response to Cyber Meddling</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs explore the modalities for attributing cyber operations to a state under international law and discuss the range of responses available to the victim state. This includes how the unlawfulness and severity of the cyber meddling determine the available international responses.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The Article then examines the various modalities for attributing a cyber operation to a State under international law. Whether cyber meddling in another State’s election is unlawful, as well as the severity thereof, determines the range of responses available to the victim State.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Conclusion and Reflections on Normative Uncertainty</h3>\r\n    <p>The final paragraph concludes the section by reflecting on the unsettled nature of the law applicable to remotely conducted meddling in elections. It highlights how this normative uncertainty creates a grey zone that could be exploited by states and non-state actors alike.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The Article concludes that the law applicable to remotely conducted meddling in another State’s election is unsettled, thereby comprising a normative grey zone ripe for exploitation by States and non-State actors.'

(Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-4 - Legal Ambiguities and Challenges</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs delve into the legal challenges posed by cyber election meddling, discussing the ambiguities within the legal framework that govern such activities, particularly those that do not cause physical damage or loss of functionality, and highlighting the lack of consensus among experts on what constitutes a sovereignty violation in these contexts.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'It was difficult to identify majority and minority views amongst the Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts on the subject.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In the author’s view, an operation rendering cyber infrastructure incapable of performing its functions in the manner intended qualifies as a sovereignty violation.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 5-7 - The Exploitation of Legal Grey Areas</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs explore how states might exploit the grey areas in international law to conduct cyber operations without clear attribution, focusing on the strategic benefits of such ambiguity for state actors in the international arena.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Interestingly, and despite disagreement over these diverse examples, each expert tended to justify his or her position by reference to “the object and purpose of the principle of sovereignty that affords States the full control over access to and activities on their territory.”' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'In light of this confusing mélange of views, it is impossible to draw definitive red lines regarding cyber election meddling in the context of the territorial aspect of sovereignty, except with respect to situations causing physical damage or at least a significant impact on functionality.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h3>Paragraph 8 - Concluding Remarks on Sovereignty and Intervention</h3>\r\n    <p>The final paragraph sums up the section by reflecting on the principles of sovereignty and intervention as they apply to cyber operations, emphasizing the ongoing need for international dialogue and clarity in defining and enforcing these principles in the realm of cyberspace.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The question is therefore what type of election meddling can be said to be coercive. Although international law provides no conclusive definition of the term, the essence of prohibited intervention lies in coercion.' (Schmitt, 2018)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p.

Extraterritorial application of human rights in cyber operations is complex and underdeveloped:</strong>\r\n<p>The study finds that existing human rights laws struggle to apply to state-sponsored cyber operations due to traditional conceptions of jurisdiction and sovereignty. The research suggests a reevaluation of extraterritorial human rights obligations to address digital election interference effectively.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'This chapter proceeds in three parts. Section II explores the current law on extraterritoriality. Section III assess the shortcomings of this existing law, in light of digital election interference.' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 199)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'However, where a state party engages in an act that affects the rights of an individual outside of that state party’s territory, human rights treaties might still apply extraterritorially.'

The \"effective control\" standard is inadequate for cyber operations:</strong>\r\n<p>The research criticizes the \"effective control\" standard used to determine extraterritorial application of human rights. It argues that this standard, which requires physical control, is unfit for the digital age where cyber operations can impact foreign elections without physical presence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Current conceptions of extraterritoriality, however, are overly focused on \"effective control,\" presupposing physical presence of the controller and power to exercise jurisdiction, both of which are absent in a digital election interference scenario.'

Proposal for a \"virtual control\" standard:</strong>\r\n<p>The study proposes a \"virtual control\" standard as a more suitable criterion for extraterritorial application of human rights in the cyber age. This new standard would focus on the capability to interfere and the actual effects of such interference, rather than physical presence.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It builds out a previously proposed \"virtual control\" standard, supported by an effects-based approach for extraterritoriality in the cyber age.'

Effects-based approach to human rights in cyberspace:</strong>\r\n<p>Emphasizing an effects-based approach, the study advocates for a focus on the consequences of state actions in cyberspace, especially how they impact the enjoyment of human rights across borders. This approach would prioritize the outcomes over mere capabilities or intentions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'My approach would focus on the effects of digital election interference on the enjoyment of human rights, which is the result of the ability to interfere in elections.'

The study suggests that current legal norms and policies may not effectively prevent or mitigate the risks associated with digital acts that interfere with election processes. This research highlights the need for a revised approach in international law that considers the realities of digital interactions and their impact on national elections.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'The focus of this chapter on extraterritoriality does not suggest that the first issue is unimportant or inconsequential. Pre-cyberspace human rights law suffers from a critical flaw in relation to the content of these rights and how they apply to a new global medium of communication.' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 198).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Theoretical Contributions</h3>\r\n<p>The theoretical contributions of this study primarily involve the introduction of the \"virtual control\" concept, which proposes a shift in how legal jurisdiction and control are understood in the digital era. By suggesting an effects-based approach for extraterritoriality in cyberspace, the research challenges traditional notions of sovereignty and control in international law, which could lead to significant revisions in how digital activities are governed across borders.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'It builds out a previously proposed “virtual control” standard, supported by an effects-based approach for extraterritoriality in the cyber age.' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 198).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The document recommends that international human rights law adapt to the challenges posed by cyberspace, particularly regarding digital election interference. It suggests implementing a revised standard of \"virtual control\" to better address how states can be held accountable for extraterritorial actions that impact the human rights of individuals in other nations. This new approach focuses on the effects of actions rather than their geographic location, proposing a significant shift in policy to ensure protection against digital threats to democracy.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'An adapted virtual control approach would look at technological capacity and power, especially given the new tools of election interference, and not whether a state is in fact occupying a foreign piece of land or has physical control over an individual.' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 212).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

XX)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> </div> ``` Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual page numbers where these quotes can be found in the document.

The findings suggest the necessity for countries to adapt their cybersecurity measures and protocols to protect the integrity of electoral processes from foreign interference. This adaptation should include both preventative strategies and robust response mechanisms to cyber threats on electoral systems.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'State-sponsored interference in foreign elections raises critical human rights issues...this raises the extraterritoriality question' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 198).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Theoretical Contributions</h3>\r\n<p>The document contributes theoretically by expanding the discussion on the extraterritorial application of human rights in the context of cyberspace and digital election interference. It challenges traditional views of sovereignty and control within the domain of international law, proposing a shift towards recognizing cyber operations as activities that can trigger state responsibility under international human rights frameworks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'This chapter proceeds in three parts. Section II explores the current law on extraterritoriality...Section IV proposes an alternative extraterritoriality conception in response to the unique challenges presented by digital election interference through cyberspace' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 198).</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>\r\n<p>The study recommends redefining the concept of extraterritoriality to better address the challenges posed by digital election interference. It suggests that international human rights law should consider the effects-based approach for cyberspace operations, focusing on the impact rather than the physical presence or control. This shift would aid in holding states accountable for cyber actions that infringe on the electoral integrity and human rights of other nations.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'An adapted virtual control standard, informed by an effects-based approach...takes into account the negative effects experienced by victimized groups of people' (Kilovaty, 2021, p. 211).</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

XX)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p.

It presents a backdrop of increasing cybercrime and espionage facilitated by network complexity and user vulnerability, setting a pessimistic tone for the feasibility of cyber deterrence.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Is it possible to prevent attacks on vital information systems? The global epidemic of cybercrime, embarrassing breaches of firms like JPMorgan Chase and Target, relentless Chinese industrial espionage, Edward Snowden’s revelations about National Security Agency surveillance, and the Stuxnet disruption of Iranian enrichment all offer ample reasons for pessimism.'</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Deterrence by Denial and Punishment</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph discusses the traditional elements of deterrence theory—deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment—and how they are undermined in cyberspace due to the ease of offensive actions over defensive ones. The difficulty in attributing cyberattacks makes retaliation uncertain and less likely, complicating the deterrence landscape.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Deterrence theory distinguishes deterrence by denial, the threat that effective defenses will defeat an attack, from deterrence by punishment, the threat that costly retaliation will offset the benefits of a successful attack. Cyberspace seems to undermine both strategies because offense is relatively easier than defense [5], and the attribution problem precludes reprisal, i.e. punishment seems to require a return address [6, 7].'</blockquote>\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 3-4 - Inadequacies of Current Deterrence Approaches</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs elaborate on the inadequacies of current deterrence strategies, citing the ineffectiveness of mild sanctions and the challenges posed by the low cost and high speed of cyber exploits. The author highlights the limitations of the existing approaches which primarily focus on punishment rather than preventive measures, indicating a gap in policy that fails to effectively deter cyber threats.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Faced with a choice between bad alternatives, many argue that denial should be emphasized over punishment [9, 10].'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'Given that most attacks tend to fall on the lower end of the value spectrum, conducted for criminal gain, surveillance, or protest rather than physical combat [17, 18], it is unsurprising that many are skeptical of deterrence.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

It emphasizes the difficulty in applying traditional legal frameworks to cyber activities due to their unique characteristics.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'International law traditionally conceives of interference by one state in the internal or external affairs of another as unlawful. However, applying this framework to cyber operations is fraught with complications.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Attribution and Legal Challenges</h3>\r\n    <p>The next two paragraphs discuss the critical role of attribution in applying international law to cyber operations and the legal ambiguities that arise from this requirement. The difficulty lies in proving state responsibility for cyber actions, which is essential for any legal recourse under current international norms.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'The requirement that a state be proven responsible for a cyber operation to attribute liability creates significant legal hurdles.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'These challenges are compounded by the often covert nature of cyber operations, which makes the identification of the responsible party both technically difficult and legally contentious.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 4-5 - Sovereignty and Non-Intervention</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs explore the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention in the context of cyber interference. They detail how cyber operations can violate these principles by affecting another state's domestic affairs without overtly breaching its territorial integrity.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Cyber operations that manipulate, disrupt, or destroy the internal systems of a state without crossing its borders still constitute a violation of sovereignty.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The principle of non-intervention is particularly relevant, as cyber operations frequently target civilian infrastructure, leading to debates about the threshold of harm that constitutes an intervention.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 6 - Responses to Cyber Interference</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph discusses the international responses to cyber interference, highlighting the lack of consensus on norms and the variability in state capabilities to respond. It reflects on the challenges of forming a cohesive international stance due to differing national interests and technological disparities.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Responses to cyber interference are varied and reflect the broader geopolitical context, which complicates the establishment of universal norms in cyber governance.'</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

The global epidemic of cybercrime, embarrassing breaches of firms like JPMorgan Chase and Target, relentless Chinese industrial espionage, Edward Snowden’s revelations about National Security Agency surveillance, and the Stuxnet disruption of Iranian enrichment all offer ample reasons for pessimism.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 2 - Pessimism in Policy and Academia</h3>\r\n    <p>The second paragraph discusses the general pessimism surrounding cyber deterrence both in policy circles and academia, noting the confusion over its definition and effectiveness.

XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p.

They include cases where evidence is exclusively controlled by one party and where the fact to be proved is a negative one. The paragraphs explore the reasoning behind such reversals and the judicial responses to these arguments.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'One is when the ordinary location of the burden gives a party some unfair advantage over the other.'</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'The argument is that the respondent to such an allegation is in a superior position to prove its compliance with law through its positive action, and a negative fact may be impossible to prove.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Judicial Reluctance and Criteria for Reversal</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph addresses the general judicial reluctance to reverse the burden of proof and the criteria that have been used by courts to justify a shift.

(McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Challenges of Attribution in Cyber Deterrence</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs discuss the challenges of attribution, which is crucial for effective cyber deterrence. It outlines the technical and geopolitical complexities involved in identifying attackers in the cyber domain, noting that anonymity and the sophisticated tactics of attackers make attribution difficult and time-consuming.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Attribution in the cyber domain is possible, but in some circumstances it can be difficult and time-consuming.'

(McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Technical and All-Source Attribution</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph differentiates between technical and all-source attribution methods. It explains how technical attribution relies on digital traces left by cyber operations, whereas all-source attribution integrates various intelligence sources to form a judgment on the attacker’s identity.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Technical attribution is the ability to associate an attack with a responsible party through technical means based on information made available by the cyber operation itself—that is, technical attribution is based on clues available at the scene(s) of the operation.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 5-6 - Limitations of Attribution and Its Implications</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs elaborate on the limitations of attribution and its implications for national security. It discusses the challenges of proving an attacker’s identity to a legal standard and the strategic necessity of maintaining the confidentiality of intelligence sources, which can hinder the transparency and credibility required for an effective deterrence strategy.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Using such sources, however, leads to another difficulty with attribution.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'At some point, the United States must publicly declare—and prove beyond a reasonable doubt—that it knows who has attacked our system.'

It identifies three main groups: criminal actors, violent nonstate actors, and state or state-sponsored actors, each with distinct motives and risk tolerances.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Cyber threats can be categorized in many ways, and each category will have different motivations and levels of cyber skills or capabilities.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 2-3 - Cyber-criminal Activity and Deterrence Challenges</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs focus on cyber-criminal activities, describing them as diverse in capability and motivation, primarily driven by financial gains. The author discusses the inherent challenges in deterring this group due to the difficulty of legal attribution and international cooperation, which limits the effectiveness of punitive measures.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Cyber-criminal activity is the largest group of cyber threats and one of the most difficult to effectively deter.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'This group of hackers ranges in sophistication from low ability (i.e., script kiddies) to elite-level hackers motivated by financial gain.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 4 - Ineffectiveness of Deterrence against Hacktivists</h3>\r\n    <p>This paragraph addresses the challenges of deterring hacktivists, who are politically or ideologically motivated. It outlines the limitations of current cyber deterrence measures against such nonstate actors, primarily due to the lack of a credible threat of legal or military action.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Our ability to deter political hacktivist groups is low for all the same reasons.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraphs 5-6 - Challenges with Nonstate-sponsored Terrorist Groups</h3>\r\n    <p>These paragraphs detail the difficulties in deterring nonstate-sponsored terrorist groups that aim to inflict harm on the United States. The author explains that these groups see the low cost of cyber attacks as a favorable cost-benefit ratio, despite the high risks associated with other forms of attack.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'This group may be more organized and have a clear goal to inflict harm against the United States or its key interests.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>'We have seen these groups successfully recruit people who are willing to die as suicide bombers for their causes. It’s not hard to envision one of these groups recruiting skilled hackers to support its fight against the United States.' (McKenzie, 2017)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Paragraph 7 - Deterrence of State-sponsored Adversaries</h3>\r\n    <p>The final paragraph discusses the relative effectiveness of deterrence strategies against state-sponsored groups, contrasting them with nonstate actors. The author argues that the potential repercussions from the international community and the direct responses available to the United States make deterrence more feasible against these actors.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>'Unlike criminal hackers or nonstate-sponsored adversaries, state-sponsored groups can be effectively deterred.'

XX)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> </div> ``` Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual page numbers where these quotes can be found in the document.

Their impact could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack. We affirm therefore that cyber defense is part of NATO's core task of collective defence.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 63)</blockquote>\r\n    <h4>Hybrid Threats</h4>\r\n    <blockquote>“We face hybrid challenges, including disinformation campaigns and malicious cyber activities … While the primary responsibility for responding to hybrid threats rests with the targeted nation, NATO is ready, upon [North Atlantic] Council decision, to assist an Ally at any stage of a hybrid campaign. In cases of hybrid warfare, the Council could decide to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as in the case of armed attack.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 70)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"

NATO's Adaptation to Cyber Threats is an Evolutionary Response to the Dynamic Security Environment:</strong>\r\n            <p>This finding underscores NATO's recognition and adaptation to cyber threats as a necessary evolution, reflecting the dynamic nature of global security threats. The alliance has progressively integrated cyber defense into its collective defense framework, responding to both the frequency and sophistication of cyber threats.</p>\r\n            <blockquote>“Cyber attacks represent a particularly daunting challenge because they were not envisioned in collective defense terms when the United Nations (UN) Charter was founded in 1945” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 61)</blockquote>\r\n            <blockquote>“Cyber attacks can reach a threshold that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability.

NATO's Official Recognition of Cyber as a Domain of Operations Enhances Its Defensive Capabilities:</strong>\r\n            <p>This conclusion emphasizes the significant step NATO took in recognizing cyber as an official domain of operations, akin to land, sea, and air, which underscores the strategic importance of cyber defense in modern military operations.</p>\r\n            <blockquote>“At their Wales summit of September 2014, NATO and its member states took the historic step of associating cyber with Article 5.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 62)</blockquote>\r\n            <blockquote>“Cyberspace was for the first time officially identified as a domain of Alliance operations joining the traditional ones of land, sea and air.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 69)</blockquote>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>3. The Strategic Ambiguity of NATO’s Cyber Defense Strategy Serves as a Deterrent:</strong>\r\n            <p>This finding highlights how NATO employs strategic ambiguity about the exact threshold for invoking collective defense in response to cyber attacks. This ambiguity acts as a deterrent by creating uncertainty for potential attackers regarding the consequences of their actions.</p>\r\n            <blockquote>“A decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 70)</blockquote>\r\n            <blockquote>“The level of cyber-attack that would provoke a response must remain purposefully vague. As will the nature of our response.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 67)</blockquote>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <strong>4. Increased Cooperation with Civil and Private Sectors is Critical for Effective Cyber Defense:</strong>\r\n            <p>This conclusion reflects NATO's strategy of strengthening partnerships beyond its traditional inter-governmental framework, particularly with civil and private sector organizations, to bolster collective cyber defense capabilities.</p>\r\n            <blockquote>“The comprehensive approach to cyber defense … would mean interacting with industry and the private sector as the principal developers and users of information technologies.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 68)</blockquote>\r\n            <blockquote>“At the behest of Estonia, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership was launched in 2014.” (Smith-Windsor, 2018, p. 72)</blockquote>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</div>"
