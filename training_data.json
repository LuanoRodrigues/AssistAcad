The main conclusions emphasize the need for standardized evidence procedures to increase the credibility and trust in political attributions of cyberattacks.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'One way of making political cyberattack attributions more credible and trustworthy is by establishing evidentiary standards that states should follow when making public declarations. More substantiated attributions could lead to a better understanding of cyberattacks and increase trust.'

(Blauth and Gstrein, 2021, p. 5)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'It is noteworthy that joint attributions by a coalition of states have demonstrated to be particularly effective, especially due to an added degree of legitimacy.'

(Burleson et al., 2022, p. 1)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Although it provides a net benefit in tracing illicit financial activity, transaction transparency makes users of blockchain technologies particularly vulnerable to fraud, social engineering, and theft of assets by bad actors.'
