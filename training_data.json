(Anderson, 2021, page 63)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Instead, a new policy—one grounded in a strategy of rapid attribution and coercive diplomacy—should be used to supplement the current void of applicable international law.' (Anderson, 2021, page 63)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Finding: Limitations of Current International Law</h3>\r\n<p>The analysis identifies significant limitations within the current international law framework, particularly its inability to effectively address the challenges posed by state-sponsored cyber activities.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Much of the United States’ delay and ambiguity in response seems, at least in part, due to a burdensome attribution process that imposes unrealistic legal standards to effectively react to cyber activities.' (Anderson, 2021, page 61)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Current international law provides limited utility when attempting to attribute cyber proxy activity to a state.' (Anderson, 2021, page 66)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Key Finding: Economic Impact of Sanctions on Russia</h3>\r\n<p>The document discusses the economic impacts of targeted sanctions on Russia, particularly those aimed at the Russian oil and gas sector, which could deter future cyber activities by Russia.</p>\r\n<blockquote>'Such attribution and sanctions will deter Russia from future cyber activities against the interests of the United States and begin to rein in the proxy actors working under Russia.' (Anderson, 2021, page 63)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>'Sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas sectors would be particularly effective because those sectors have enormous influence in the Russian government.'

This focus might limit the applicability of the proposed strategies against a broader array of cyber threats that are not state-sponsored.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Much of the United States’ delay and ambiguity in response seems, at least in part, due to a burdensome attribution process that imposes unrealistic legal standards to effectively react to cyber activities.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 61)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"To date, the United States has tried a variety of methods to hold Russia accountable for its cyber activities including: indicting Russian intelligence officers; sanctioning the assets of individual Russian officials; and implementing broader economic sanctions.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 61)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reliance on Economic Sanctions</h3>\r\n<p>The paper suggests using economic sanctions as a primary tool for coercive diplomacy, which might not be sustainable or effective in the long term, especially if Russia develops economic resilience or alternative trade partnerships.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"Such attribution and sanctions will deter Russia from future cyber activities against the interests of the United States and begin to rein in the proxy actors working under Russia.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 63)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The Russian economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports, making up roughly 60 percent of Russia’s exports and 30 percent of its gross domestic product.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 67)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Attribution Challenges</h3>\r\n<p>The proposed rapid attribution strategy may face significant technical and political challenges, especially in cases where attribution cannot be conclusively established, potentially leading to diplomatic disputes or errors in response.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"The speed with which cyber incidents occur, the obfuscation of actors, and plausible deniability through cyber proxies make current legal regimes untenable.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 61)</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Much of the United States’ delay and ambiguity in response seems, at least in part, due to a burdensome attribution process that imposes unrealistic legal standards to effectively react to cyber activities.\" (Anderson, 2021, page 61)</blockquote>"
