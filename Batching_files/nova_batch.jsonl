However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and \nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence \nsubmitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers \nto data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic \nform or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The \nadmissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, \nand ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or \nerasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is \nconsidered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the \nadmissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In cases where the maker can't identify \nthe voice, stringent proof is necessary to establish it as the alleged speaker's voice. \n2. Verification of Accuracy: The maker of the recording must prove the accuracy of the \nrecorded statement through high-quality evidence, either direct or circumstantial. \n3. Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4. Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5. Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6. Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved.

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Balancing Test: Lastly, the potential risks of prejudice, confusion, or undue delay \nversus the probative value of the electronic evidence should be weighed. \nFor proponents to successfully use electronic evidence, these fundamental principles must be \nmeticulously followed. \n\u2022 \nLogical Relevance: According to Federal rules of evidence, relevant proof is \nadmissible while irrelevant proof is not. The court's determination of logical relevance \nis reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. This logical relevance test is applied \nto electronic evidence in a manner similar to traditional evidence, ensuring fairness and \nconsistency. \n\u2022 \nAuthentication: Ensuring the authenticity of electronic evidence is crucial. Given the \nsusceptibility of electronic data to manipulation, rigorous measures must be taken to \nmaintain its admissibility. Courts must ascertain, beyond any doubt, the integrity and \noriginality of electronic evidence to prevent any miscarriage of justice. \nIn summary, maintaining the authenticity, relevance, and integrity of electronic evidence is \nimperative to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings. Courts must rigorously scrutinize \nelectronic evidence to maintain the fairness and accuracy of the judicial process. \nExamining the Legal Landscape: Evidence Laws in India \nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 was enacted to address the emerging need for \nregulations in cyberspace. It introduced concepts like 'digital signatures,' 'encryption,' and \n'electronic evidence,' which were previously unfamiliar in the law of evidence. Initially, there \nwere no provisions to introduce them as evidence in courts. \nConsequently, amendments were made to the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 to align it \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and \nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence \nsubmitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers \nto data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic \nform or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The \nadmissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, \nand ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or \nerasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is \nconsidered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the \nadmissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5. Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6. Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved.

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier. However, in the case of R.K. Anand v.

Having lost the appeal in the high court, the appellants appealed to the apex \ncourt. \nThe evidence presented in the case consisted of three elements: digital data, \ndocumentary evidence other than digital data, and oral evidence.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where \nevidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, \nthe Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science \nLaboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was \nnot suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the \nconversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch \nwitnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to \nanalysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without \na credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar \ncase, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements \nfor admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High \nCourt dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as \ndefined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a \nfeasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory \nchip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the \nlaboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being \ncompared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then \nthe transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or \nadmissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link \nbetween the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it \nas evidence in legal proceedings.

However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and \nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence \nsubmitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers \nto data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic \nform or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The \nadmissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, \nand ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or \nerasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is \nconsidered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the \nadmissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The counsel for the respondents argued that the \nconversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch \nwitnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to \nanalysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without \na credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar \ncase, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements \nfor admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High \nCourt dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as \ndefined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a \nfeasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory \nchip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the \nlaboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being \ncompared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then \nthe transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or \nadmissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link \nbetween the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it \nas evidence in legal proceedings. Without such a link and without verification methods such as \ncomparing hash values, the authenticity and reliability of the digital evidence, such as the \ncontent on the CD, may come into question and might not be accepted as credible evidence in \ncourt16. \n \n15 CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4288  OF 2017 \n16 S.

As our world increasingly digitizes, the significance of cyber \nforensics in uncovering and prosecuting cybercrimes has risen exponentially. This discipline \nrevolves around the concept of electronic evidence (e-evidence), encompassing all forms of \ndigital information admissible in legal proceedings, spanning data from computers, networks, \nmobile devices, cloud services, and more17. \nThe intersection between cyber forensics and e-evidence is profound, serving as the \ncornerstone in uncovering facts associated with cybercrimes. Let's delve into the intricate \nrelationship between these two domains: \n1. Collection and Preservation: Cyber forensics revolves around the meticulous collection \nand preservation of e-evidence to uphold its integrity and admissibility in court. Just \nlike traditional crime scenes require careful handling, digital crime scenes demand \nequal care. Cyber forensics specialists employ specialized techniques to secure \nelectronic data without altering its original state, preventing data tampering or \nspoliation, ensuring its reliability. \n2. Data Recovery: Cyber forensics techniques are crucial in recovering data from diverse \nsources like hard drives, solid-state drives, and memory cards, often intentionally \ndeleted, hidden, or corrupted. Advanced software and methodologies aid in data \nrecovery, significantly contributing to building a case. \n3. Analysis: Extracted e-evidence undergoes meticulous analysis employing various tools \nand techniques to examine log files, metadata, and system artifacts.

The International Court of\nJustice is a part of the United Nations Organization although it has a separate\nstatute.

Undiscriminating laymen, particularly those who have lost lawsuits, have\nobserved from time to time that the world might be much better off without lawyers.\n3. The World Court, as of 1956, had given thirty-eight advisory opinions. All of\nthe requests to the Permanent Court of International Justice for advisory opinions\nwere made by the Council of the League. All of the requests to the International\nCourt of Justice, except one made by UNESCO, have been made by the General\nAssembly. The General Assembly, the Security Council, and other organs of the\nUnited Nations and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly to\nmake the requests, may request advisory opinions. U.N. CHARTER art. 96.\n4. Prior to World War II, state disputes were sometimes presented to the Court\nin the form of requests for advisory opinions. This practice is discussed in greater\ndetail subsequently in this Article. With some possible exceptions, such as the right\nof the United Nations to protect its employees, only a State can be a party to con-\ntentious proceedings before the Court. A respondent State cannot be brought before\nthe Court without its consent. Consent may be expressed in a special agreement\nsubmitting the case to the Court, or it may be expressed in advance of the dispute\nby acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction. The \"optional clause\" in the statute of the\nCourt provides a procedure whereby States may accept compulsory jurisdiction in\nrelation to other States accepting the same obligation in certain classes of disputes.\nThese disputes are those that are \"legal\" and which involve a question of treaty inter-\n(37)\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The legal guidance which the Court\ngives or the judgment which it renders will be a useless abstraction\nunless it is based upon actual events, formulated in the light of exist-\ning events, and designed to influence the shape of future events. The\ntendency of national courts to decide cases which are in effect hypo-\nthetical because of fact-finding lapses is dismally familiar to lawyers\nand litigants. The World Court has obstacles to the finding of facts\nwhich national courts do not encounter. The tendency of the Court\nto decide hypothetical cases therefore is stronger. The more efficient\nthe fact finding processes of the World Court become, the better are\nits opportunities to render useful decisions and give sound legal guid-\nance to the Organization.\nThe work of the Court as a creator of symbols and the relationship\nto this work of fact finding are less obvious matters.

The problem of the Organization is somewhat\nanalogous to that of a human being who must create in his own en-\nvironment his rational fiction of what he believes himself to be. Once\nthe human being creates his fiction he feels obligated to measure up\npretation, of international law, or of the existence of any fact which if established\nwould constitute a breach of an international obligation, or of the nature or extent\nof the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation. \nSTAT.\nINT'L CT.

This is not to impugn the good intention\nor deny the manifest ability of any statesman involved. The observa-\ntion is intended only to illustrate the point that no dynamic symbol of\ninternational government has been created in the minds of men or,\napparently, is in the making. A living organization is an image in\nthe minds of men, an image of what men think the organization should\nbe rather than a collection of constitutions, by-laws, organizational\nroutines, functonaries and filing cabinets.\nIgnoring for immediate purposes the complex variables that are\ninvolved in establishing a pattern of human conduct, three basic steps\nare necessary to create a leadership symbol in the mind of a man. He\nmust be provoked to respond to a principle since a response to principle\nis more intense and enduring than a response to other stimuli. He\nmust also be permitted to respond to inconsistent principles.5 A man\nis prepared to give his primary loyalty to a leadership symbol if he\ncan reserve loyalty to secondary symbols. If loyalty to secondary sym-\nbols is not permitted, loyalty to a primary leadership symbol is never\ndeveloped or, if developed, is greatly weakened. A man stoutly resists\nslavery of his mind. It is in his mind that the defenses of self-respect\nare erected. It has been aptly remarked that a loss of self-respect is\nthe first step to treason. But a third step is also necessary to create a\nnew leadership symbol. The mind must be helped to reconcile its re-\nsponse to inconsistent principles. Some rational and acceptable ex-\nplanation must be forthcoming to justify response to a primary leader-\nship symbol while a response to other symbols is continued. New\nleadership symbols are constructed in the human mind and old symbols\nare diffused or subordinated in importance in this process of reconcil-\ning conflicting principles.\nIt is in the third basic step in developing leadership symbols that\nthe judicial system of an emerging political society usually figures so\nprominently. In England, for example, the Common Law courts ham-\nmered out the concept of a fictional and responsible Crown to which\nparamount loyalty was due. The conflicting loyalties and confused\n5.

Again, the Commerce Clause has been applied by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States to events produced by a growing industrial\nsociety in such a way that the federal government has assumed the\ndirection of economic affairs while the role of state authority has been\ncorrespondingly reduced. The task of the World Court is to create\nan image of the United Nations in the minds of men as a primary\nleadership symbol without eroding to any appreciable degree the re-\nsponse of men to State and other parochial symbols.\nThe part played by courts in developing leadership symbols in\nthe early stages of formation of a political society differs radically from\ntheir role when a political society has matured. When leadership\nsymbols have been developed and are firmly implanted, an insistence\nupon loyalty to primary leadership symbols appears to produce minor\nbut frequent shifts in attitudes concerning subordinate symbols. In\nthis situation, the minds of men are more easily manipulated through\nrepresentative bodies with flexible procedures and in close contact with\nthe daily life of a community than the courts. In the United States\nthe disorderly growth of fraternal benefit societies and business cor-\nporations after the Civil War required action by the Congress or by\nthe state legislatures. The courts could not deal with public utility\nholding companies in the Twentieth Century until the Congress enacted\nlegislation for that purpose. The function of a court in a matured\npolitical society tends to become of an interstitial and housekeeping\nnature.' The court of an emerging political society must be a laborer\nof all work.\nSince peace was sought unsuccessfully in the League experiment,\nit would not have been shocking to those who follow the work of\ninternational organizations closely if the San Francisco Conference\nhad produced an international court system designed to spark a sound\nand orderly growth of world government. It is the drive for resolu-\ntion of conflict that provides the incentive for the formation of new\npolitical societies. As a principal resolver of conflict, the adjudicator\nhas always been an obvious choice, for it is in its courts that an emerg-\ning government has its closest contact with the governed. But a court\nin an inchoate political system must be more than the simple adjudi-\n6. The term \"interstitial\" is used here in the sense that the Court functions as an\nauxiliary to institutions which are charged with the continuous making, undoing and\nremaking of policies that the management of a complex community requires. The\nCourt, of course, creates conditions under which policies are made by other institu-\ntions, but it does this spasmodically without clear cut policing of the effects of its\ndecisions and consequent necessary adjustments.\n[VOL. 4: p. 37\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

We are not now concerned\nwith the role of the World Court in a matured political society. That\nproblem can be faced many generations hence by people better prepared\nto deal with it.\nThe Court established at San Francisco in 1945 is primarily an\nadjudicating institution in the \"national\" sense.8 The statute of the\nCourt is almost the same as that of the Permanent Court of Interna-\ntional Justice with which it maintains, practically speaking, an un-\nbroken tradition and skein of experience. To the ordinary man, 9 the\nman whose influence will determine ultimately whether there will be\neffective international organization or not, the World Court is as re-\nmote as the Supreme Court of Saturn.

The hazards involved in turning courts to\npolitical ends are well documented, e.g., United States v. Alstoetter, 3 Nurenberg\nMilitary Tribunals, Trials of War Criminals, Case 3 at 31 (1947) ; VYssIINSKY, THE\nLAW op THE SovIET STATE 497-98 (1951). \nA number of the able jurists associated\nwith the Permanent Court or the International Court of Justice have argued for\nmoderation in seeking an extension of the Court's authority or more reasonable\nexpectations concerning the type of work the Court is to do. E.G., DeVisscher,\nReflections on the Present Prospects of International \nAdjudication, 50 AM. J. INT'L\nL. 467 (1956).

Rep. 57, quotes Judge Hudson, a former Judge of the Permanent Court, upon\nthe point that the activity of the Court should not be \"artificially stimulated.\"\n15. In certain rare instances individuals have had an opportunity to get their\ncases before the Court. In Danzig Legislative Decrees, P.C.I.J., Ser. A/B, No. 65\n(advisory opinion 1935), the Court considered a dispute concerning a statute enacted\nby the Danzig Senate applying the criminal law doctrine of analogy. The Court deter-\nmined that the Free City of Danzig should have State status for this proceeding.\nThis meant, in effect, that the Court would hear only one side of the case since the\nSenate represented the Free City and the Senate was Nazi-controlled. The President\nof the Court therefore received an explanatory note from the opposing political parties\nin Danzig, although these parties were not allowed to be representd in the oral\nproceedings.\n[VOL. 4: p. 37\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

There\nis, for example, no incompatibility between the function of judge and\nacting as chairman of an ad hoc committee set up by the General\nAssembly with a view to finding a humanitarian solution to the prob-\nlem of prisoners of war.\"\n8 On the other hand, any function which\ncompels a judge to follow the instructions of his government, regard-\nless of his personal views, is political. This includes the position of\ndelegate for a government to the International Labor Conference. 64\nThe principle applied by the Permanent Court to determine the in-\ncompatibility of the function of judge and service on an arbitral tri-\nbunal was, originally, whether the agreement upon which the arbi-\ntration was based provided for an appeal to the Court or settlement\nby the Court in case the arbitration failed. 5 At a later date this\nprinciple was abandoned upon the assumption that the judge could\nbe disqualified if the case ultimately came before the Court.66\nThe International Court of Justice has applied a principle more\nrestrictive than that established originally by the Permanent Court.\nA judge may not accept the functions of arbitrator, chairman of a\ncommission of conciliation or inquiry, or any similar function, if there\nis any provision to the effect that a decision taken by him, or one\nin which he has taken part, may be the subject of an application to\nthe Court or if there is a possibility that the decision may be the sub-\nject of an application.6\"\nThe judges of the World Court should be encouraged to par-\nticipate actively in international affairs collateral to their duties upon\nthe Court.

Treaties\nsometimes provide for appointment by the President of the Court of\narbitrators, umpires or members of conciliation commissions. Thus,\nthe Treaty of Lausanne provided for appointment of the President of\nthe Mixed Arbitral Tribunals by the President of the Court if the\nparties could not agree upon a selection. The President performed\nthis function in 1924 by appointing a President for the Greco-Turkish\nand Romano-Turkish Tribunals. 9 Special requests are sometimes made\nby States or international organizations for appointments to fill special\noffices. In 1954 the President nominated a Chairman for a Special\nAdvisory Board appointed by the Secretary-General of the United\nNations.7\" Requests are also made by corporations to appoint arbi-\ntrators to settle contract disputes and these requests are usually granted.\nCertain appointments, quite certainly, have no potential value to\nthe Court as information sources.7 \nBut in other instances, such as an\nappointment of members of a conciliation commission or arbitral board,\nthe appointment could be conditioned upon reports by the member\nconcerned or upon his willingness to testify or produce evidence be-\nfore the Court if later called upon. The President is usually approached\nand his consent secured before the treaty provision or special request\nfor appointment is made. The appointing practice does seem to be a\nbud from which increased efficiency in finding facts could quickly flower.\nIII.\nALLOCATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE TASK.\nJudge Hudson, in his careful and distinguished treatment of the\nwork of the Permanent Court of International Justice, states: \"Issues\nof fact are seldom tried before the Court, and where a question ot\nfact arises the Court must usually base its finding on statements made\non behalf of the parties either in the documents of the written pro-\nthe Court have general diplomatic immunity in the Netherlands.

The\nburden is on the opponent to produce the facts and, if he can be kept\nfrom getting them in, so much the better for the client. The practice\nhas been tolerated not only because of the lawyer's affection for tradi-\ntion but because the judge does not have the time to set out upon ex-\ntensive fact-finding inquiries of his own. The judge is an umpire at\ntrial. The judge on appeal tends to accept the facts produced at trial.\nThere is no reason why this situation should exist in cases brought\nbefore the World Court. The General List of the Court is not over-\ncrowded and the judges, or at least most of them, are not imbued with\nAnglo-American legal traditions. Why are the parties allowed to per-\nform the major fact-finding function before the World Court? Who\nmakes the decisions which determine who finds the facts?\nThe statute of the Court sets forth the major outlines of the\nfact-finding missions which the Court can pursue. Since the statute\nis based upon State consent and State consent pervades the entire\nproblem of the Court's jurisdiction, it is understandable that special\ndeference should be shown to the statements made by State repre-\nsentatives and the facts produced by them. Nevertheless, in spite of\nthe very real obstacle that State consent presents in fact-finding, this\nsingle factor cannot explain why the Court has not moved with greater\nfreedom in finding facts within the confines that its statute establishes.\nTwo factors appear to account for the reticence of the Court,\nparticularly in contentious cases, to make independent inquiries. The\nCourt has been prone to regard executive-administrative findings-of-\nfact as conclusive because of the limitations set by the statute upon\nits own fact-finding activities. This predisposition has carried over\ninto contentious litigation, the State being treated as an administrative\nfact-finder whose conclusions must be accepted at face value unless\nmanifestly questionable. Likewise, in the history of the Permanent\nCourt, there were efforts to use the Court as a fact-finding institution\nfor the League and other international organizations. This resulted in\nresistence within the Court to any extension of judicial fact-finding\nactivity.\n72.

The Notion of Executive-Administrative Finality.\nIn the Anglo-American and Civil Law judicial systems the theory\nof finality of administrative and legislative findings-of-fact has been\nfirmly implanted. The theory may be based upon constitutional sepa-\nration of powers, upon a need for efficiency in sifting voluminous facts\nor upon the inability of the Court to appraise remote events. It is\nunderstandable that judges trained in the Anglo-American and Civil\nLaw systems should tend to apply these theories to the work of the\nWorld Court. There is also more justification for the application of\ntheories of finality when the fact-finding ability of the Court is sub-\nstantially curtailed. The Court has no processes to compel the pro-\nduction of evidence. It may request of public international organiza-\ntions information relative to cases before it,73 and may call upon the\nagents to produce any document or supply any explanation. 7\n4 Relevant\nquestions may be put to witnesses and experts.7\n3 But the Court must\ndepend upon the consent of States to produce witnesses or permit the\nmaking of inquiries on the spot.76 Requests for advisory opinions\nmust be accompanied by all documents \"likely to throw light\" upon\nthe question. 77\nLacking the necessary power to compel the production of the\nevidence it may need, the Court tends to rely heavily upofi the evidence\nsubmitted without positive efforts to police the truth of the facts. In\nthe case of The Prince of Pless,7\n8 Poland maintained that the German\napplication was inadmissible so long as the Prince had failed to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies in Poland. The Court found it unnecessary\nto pass upon the issue of exhaustion of remedies: \"Since in any event\nit will certainly be an advantage to the Court, as regards the points\nwhich have to be established in the case, to be acquainted with the final\ndecision of the Supreme Polish Administrative Tribunal upon the\nappeals brought by the Prince von Pless and now pending before that\ntribunal and .. .the Court must therefore arrange its procedure so\nas to insure that this will be possible.

The details of the use by the Council of\nadvisory opinions as a device for presenting contentious litigation to\nthe Court are considered hereafter. But once the entering wedge was\nplaced, the Council also sought advisory opinions relating to the diffi-\ncuties of the Free City of Danzig. The Free City was a ward of the\nCouncil and was under the general supervision of a High Commis-\nsioner. In a series of cases, the first group involving Polish claims\nto certain functions within the City and access to port facilities and\nthe second rising out of Nazi party activity within the City, the Council\nthrew administrative problems into the lap of the Court that probably\ncould and should have been solved by the Council and High Commis-\nsioner without judicial action. 5 There was also a tendency to try to\nthrust upon the Court some of the fact-finding problems of the Mixed\nCommission for the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations under\nthe Convention of Lausanne. The Court dutifully complied with the\nrequests for aid in the Danzig cases, although in Danzig Legislative\nDecrees, Judge Anzilotti remarked:\n\"All that can be said is that the reason why the Council asked\nfor the Court's opinion was because it desired to be informed as\nto the scope and effects of certain provisions of the Danzig Con-\nstitution and of certain acts of the Senate, in order to enable it\nto exercise the guarantees of the League of Nations.

This is\nnot because the parties are anxious to quickly reach a peaceful solu-\ntion but simply because neither party has enough facts to question\nthe facts submitted by the other. Records may be lost, the events in\nquestion may have occurred within the territory of one of the parties,\nor the case might be pitched on events long passed. When the facts\ndo get into dispute in the usual proceeding on the merits it is because\none of the parties by espionage or other informal practices has suc-\nceeded in penetrating the barriers to the flow of information established\nby the other.\nIn the Oscar Chinn Case\n93 the British were unable to dispute the\nBelgian allegations of fact concerning the de facto monopoly alleged\nby the British because the evidence the British needed was in the\nBelgian Congo.

In the Case of Interpretation\nof Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (The Chorzow Factory),\"9 the Court\nagreed to interpret a passage in Judgment No. 7: \"If Poland wishes\nto dispute the validity of this entry, it can, in any case, only be an-\nnulled in pursuance of a decision given by the competent tribunal.\"\nPoland had contended that the land-book entry was invalid, and, after\nthe judgment, commenced a proceeding before the Tribunal of Kato-\nwice to annul it. The Court was required to interpret the passage in\nJudgment No. 7 in the light of the supervening act by Poland in com-\nmencing annulment proceedings before its own tribunal. The super-\nvening act provoked the request for interpretation.\nHow far the Court will consider new facts in the guise of in-\nterpretation is presently an open question. Clearly the Court will not\nentertain a new line of factual argument not originally submitted.\nThus in the Columbian-Peruvian \nAsylum Case\"' Columbia presented\nan abstract question whether Columbia was \"competent, as the country\nto qualify the offense for the purpose of said asylum.\" The Court\nanswered the question in the abstract: Columbia did not have a right\nto qualify the nature of the offense by a unilateral and definitive de-\ncision binding on Peru. But the Court held that there was no urgency\njustifying the asylum, although Mr. de la Torre, the refugee in ques-\ntion, was not a common criminal as contended by Peru. While this\ndecision disposed of an abstract question presented by Columbia, it\ndid not dispose of Mr. de la Torre who was still in the Columbian\nembassy at Lima. On the day the judgment was rendered, Columbia\nrequested an interpretation. The Court refused to give this inter-\npretation, noting that it had not passed on the issue whether Colum-\nbia's qualification was in fact correct. The purpose of the request must\n117. STAT.

Allocation of the Intelligence Task in Advisory Cases.\nIn contrast to the restricted rule of the Court in allocating fact-\nfinding missions in contentious cases, in advisory cases the ultimate\ndecision as to who finds what facts and where the facts are to be found\nrests with the Court. There are several reasons for this. The most\nimportant reason is that the statute of the Court places no substantial\nlimits upon its activity in advisory cases.'24 Also, while advisory de-\ncisions may be binding in a moral sense and are usually accepted by\nthe organizations or States concerned, the advisory decision is bind-\ning in a legal sense only when the parties have agreed by treaty or\nconvention that the advisory opinion is to bind.'25 States have little\nto lose and much to gain by participating in advisory proceedings. The\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly may request advisory\nopinions. \nLikewise other organs of the United Nations and the\nspecialized agencies may make the requests when authorized by the\nGeneral Assembly. 26 A State cannot request an advisory opinion di-\nrectly but may be able to persuade the General Assembly or some other\norganization authorized to seek advisory opinions to make the request\n121.

This may also be the case when the States participate in\nthe proceeding, but a request for an opinion should not in principle\nbe refused.' 83 When the opinion relates to legal grounds actually pend-\ning between States, the opinion has no binding force.

The rules provide that if the\nrequest for an advisory opinion relates to legal questions actually\npending between States the provisions of the statute relating to ad hoc\njudges shall apply.\" 6 In applying the provisions of the statute re-\nlating to contentious proceedings to advisory proceedings the Court\nhas stated that it will \"above all consider whether the advisory opinion\nrelates to a legal question actually pending between two or more\nStates.\"' 8\nSince 1946, the General Assembly, which has requested all except\none of the advisory opinions, has presented its questions in abstract\nform. In at least one instance the question was so abstract that the\nCourt could not answer it directly.

In view of numerous references to this case in the subsequent materials the\nfacts of the case are stated briefly here. On October 22, 1946, two British destroyers,\nH.M.S. \"Saumarez\" and H.M.S. \"Volage\" struck mines while passing through the\nfairway of the Corfu Channel. These vessels were part of a squadron passing through\nthe Channel subject to secret British orders X.C.U. Upon receipt of the report of the\nmining, the Central International Mine Clearance Board recommended that the\nchannel be reswept at a favorable opportunity (the channel having been swept prior\nto October 1946), but stated that the sweeping of the channel remained an issue out-\nside its scope. The British nevertheless swept the channel on the 12th and 13th of\nNovember, 1946 (Operation Retail). A member of the Mediterranean Mine Clearance\nBoard, Commander Mestre, attended the sweeping as an observer. Two German G-Y\nmines were recovered and taken to Malta for inspection. Diplomatic negotiations with\nAlbania having failed, the British took the case before the Security Council under\nArticle 35 of the Charter. Albania accepted an invitation to attend the Security\nCouncil proceedings upon condition of her acceptance, for the purposes of the dispute,\nof the obligations of a member of the United Nations. The Security Council appointed\na subcommittee to investigate the facts, and the report of this committee was con-\nsidered by the Council. Ultimately, a finding by the Council adverse to Albania was\nblocked by the veto, but a British resolution referred the case to the World Court.\nThe British brought the case before the Court by application, and Albania raised a\npreliminary question of jurisdiction on the ground that the case should have been\nsubmitted by special agreement. The Court decided that it was unnecessary to pass\nupon this issue because Albania had voluntarily accepted its jurisdiction by a letter of\nJuly 2, 1947. Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection), Judgment of March 25,\n1948, [1947-48] I.C.J. Rep. 15.\nImmediately after this decision the case was submitted by special agreement. The\nclaim of the United Kingdom in this agreement was Albanian responsibility for the\nexplosions and liability for the resulting damages. The British case was that the\nmines were laid by Yugoslavia with Albanian connivance or that Albania knew the\nmines had been laid and failed to give notice as required by international law. Albania\ncounterclaimed that the United Kingdom had violated her sovereignty on October 22,\n1946, not having been in innocent passage, and had again violated her sovereignty in\nOperation Retail on the 12th and 13th of November 1946. After hearing witnesses\nand directing an expert inquiry on the spot, the Court gave judgment for the British\non their claim on the ground that Albania knew or should have known of the mining\nand failed to give warning; the court gave judgment for Albania on that part of her\ncounterclaim pertaining to Operation Retail. The Court determined the indemnity in\na separate proceeding in which Albania refused to participate. A second committee of\nexperts was formed to aid the Court in determining the indemnity due.

After two British requests, the Albanian agent also submitted\na statement of the substance of the testimony his witnesses would\noffer.16\nThe general plan of procedure was arranged at a meeting between\nthe President of the Court and the agents on November 8, 1948, a\nday prior to commencement of the oral proceedings. In general, the\nplan was that two British counsel would make opening statements\nfollowed by an answer by counsel for Albania. Then the witnesses\nwere to be examined. The British were then to make their reply\napproximately twenty-four hours after the last of the witnesses was\nheard and the Albanian counsel would then make their rejoinder.'65\nAs soon as the first part of the oral arguments had been completed\nthe President ordered the agents to inform the Registrar of the par-\nticulars of the witnesses whom they proposed to call.\nThe hearing of witnesses commenced on November 22, 1948, and\nlasted until December 14, 1948.

The flexibility of the Court's\nprocedures are well illustrated by the examination of Commander\nKovacic. The features which would enhance the effectiveness of the\nuse of testimony will require changes in the statute or the conclusion\nof a special convention. The Court needs the authority to compel the\nproduction of witnesses or at least the States should undertake to enact\nnational laws for the production of needed witnesses and documents.\nIt is also desirable that a witness be given immunity for testimony\noffered before the Court. Immunity should extend to criminal prose-\ncution if general immunity cannot be granted.\nB. Special and Expert Inquiries.\nThe Court may make a special inquiry into facts, including in-\nvestigations on the spot, in two ways. Members of the Court may be\ncommissioned to make the inquiry. Technical experts may be com-\nmissioned to investigate matters of a type for which their training\nmakes them particularly suitable.\nThe Court has power to create Special Chambers.19' In con-\ntentious proceedings the use of Chambers requires the consent of the\nparties. In advisory proceedings, however, the Court could use\nChambers as it saw fit.\"\n94 If Chambers were formed for the purpose of\ninvestigation, the Chamber could not only investigate but also could\ndecide the case.\"\n95 The regular use of Chambers for this purpose\nwould, in effect, create a supplementary court system.

Evidence is seldom excluded by the Court.\n(1.) \nUnreasonable \nSearches and Seizures.\nThe Court appears to accept evidence no matter how it was\nobtained by the party which produces it. In the Corfu Channel Case\nevidence was admitted which had been obtained by espionage.224 Part\nof the key evidence in the British case had been obtained by the in-\nternational equivalent of an \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" After\nthe mining incident of October 22, 1946, the British swept the Corfu\nchannel in \"Operation Retail\" (November 1946) over the protest of\nAlbania. Twenty-two mines were cut and two mines, which proved\nto be German mines of the G.Y. type, were recovered and taken to\nMalta. The mines appeared to have been laid a short time before\nthe incident of 22 October. The Court admitted evidence obtained\nfrom examination of the mines and related technical details. In answer\nto Albania's counterclaim that the United Kingdom had violated her\nsovereignty in \"Operation Retail,\" the British argued that they were\nsecuring evidence for the Court which might have been lost if the\nmines had been removed by Albania or had been equipped with auto-\nmatic flooding devices. The British also argued that self help justified\ntheir action. Both arguments were rejected by the Court and the United\nKingdom was held liable on the counterclaim. The evidence obtained,\nhowever, formed part of the basis for the decision of the Court that\nAlbania was liable to the United Kingdom on the British claim.\nAn exclusion of evidence by the Court based upon the way in\nwhich it was secured would be unrealistic in view of the known barriers\nestablished by States to the flow of information. The Court is not\nfaced with the problem of intermittent police abuses of individuals\nwhich national constitutional guarantees are designed to minimize.\nThe Court must get its evidence when and by whatever means it can\nobtain it.\n223.

The British further argued that the burden\nof going forward with the evidence was shifted to Albania because\nAlbania had exclusive control of its territorial waters and adjacent\nland and knowledge of the events preceding the mining was likely to\nbe confined to her government. 2\n38  Albania appeared to admit the\nburden of proof on her counter-claim but argued that the British bore\nthe burden of proof on their defenses of innocent passage, securing\nevidence for the Court and self help.2 3\n9 The British answered that,\nassuming the Albanian contention was true, once the British established\nthe principle of their exception, the burden would shift to Albania to\nshow that the British had exceeded their rights. The Court rejected\nthe British argument that exclusive control and special knowledge\nby Albania shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence on\nthe issue of complicity.\n24\u00b0 The Court ruled in favor of Albania on\nthat part of its counterclaim pertaining to \"Operation Retail\" and\nthus did not pass upon the issue whether, if the British could have\nproved their exception, the burden of going forward with the evidence\non the issue of unreasonable exercise of the British rights would have\nshifted.\nIn the Minquiers and Erechos Case\n241 the special agreement be-\ntween France and the United Kingdom stated their intent as to the\npresentation of pleadings without prejudice to any question as to the\nburden of proof.

Judicial \nNotice.\nThe judges of the Court often bring to a case facts that have not,\nstrictly speaking, been introduced in evidence.

By its statute the Court is\nnot restricted to the evidence produced by the parties. Informal con-\ntributions by the judges are inevitable and desirable. Thus, while\nthe Court has had occasion to take judicial notice of certain facts,\njudicial notice has been used more often to describe the things that\nthe Court will not consider without proof. For example, the Court\nhas stated that it will not take notice of a municipal law but will obtain\nknowledge of it with the aid of the parties or by inquiries by the\nCourt.\n244 On the other hand, the Court will take notice of treaties\nand administrative acts relating to them.245 The Court will also take\nnotice of historical events2\n40 and publicized contemporary political\nsituations.\n247\n(5.) \nCircumstantial Evidence -\nAdverse Presumptions.\nThe Court has dealt with circumstantial evidence in a number\nof cases. 48 In the Corfu Channel Case the Court based its decision on\nthe British claim upon circumstantial evidence and thus found it neces-\nsary to discuss the matter in detail.

He offered\nhearsay evidence that the mines had been laid in the Corfu Channel. 256\nThe testimony supported the British contention that the mines had been\nlaid with Albanian connivance.

In\n1926, President Huber proposed a new rule of Court placing the\nresponsibility on the party which introduced the secret information\nand allowing the opposing party to demand a private hearing.26 9 The\nproposal met with much opposition from the Court on the ground that\nit was superfluous and perhaps dangerous since the parties acting\ntogether might produce any information they saw fit. The consensus\nof the Court appeared to be that the State producing the information\nwas responsible in principle and that the Court could exclude evidence\nwhich it could not properly take into account and make public.\n2 7\n0\nResistance to the jurisdiction of the Court or obstruction of its\nfact gathering processes on security grounds is a more serious matter.\nThe principal difficulty encountered by the Permanent Court was in\nobtaining preparatory materials used for the Versailles Conference.271\nIn his dissenting opinion in the Oscar Chinn Case, Judge Van Eysinga\nnoted:\n\"The undersigned cannot refrain in this connection from\nexpressing his regret that the Court should frequently be called\nupon to give decisions in regard to collective conventions con-\ncluded after the Great War without having at its disposal the rec-\nords of the meetings at which these conventions were elaborated,\nthese records being kept secret. The resulting lack of information\nhas more than once made itself felt in the present case.\n272\nThe security restrictions proved an embarrassment even in those\ncases in which one of the parties offered to produce the necessary\nmaterials. In The Jurisdiction of the European Commission of the\nDanube\n271 the agent of one of the States cited certain records of the\npreparation of the Versailles treaty. Counsel for another State ob-\njected to the use of the records in evidence because they were secret.\nOne of the States interested in the proceeding offered to supply the\nrecords in question.

The\nCourt reversed its decision on the matter of admitting the records in\nevidence pending an answer to its inquiry but delivered its opinion\nbefore the answer was received. Subsequently the President of the\nConference of Ambassadors expressed his appreciation of the Court's\nrefusal to take the secret documents into consideration without the\nunanimous consent of all States concerned.\nWhile the Permanent Court did not renounce its authority to re-\nquest the production of documents, secret or not, in some cases secret\ndocuments were excluded upon grounds that avoided the secrecy\nissue.\n274 In the case of International \nCommission of the Oder\n275 the\nPolish agent referred to preparatory work done by the Commission\non Ports, Waterways and Railways of the Versailles Conference. The\nevidence was excluded on the ground that the Polish agent did not\nintend to make use of these records in his defense and the records\ncould not be used in any event since three of the parties in the case,\nGermany, Denmark and Sweden, had not participated in the prepara-\ntory work and the materials could not be used to determine for them\nthe meaning of the treaty.\nSince the Corfu Channel Case, few advisory opinions or conten-\ntious proceedings presented to the Court have involved serious security\nissues.\" 6 In those cases in which security issues might have been\ninvolved, the defendant State has not accepted the jurisdiction of the\nCourt.277 \nSecurity considerations will probably be the catalysts de-\ntermining which cases are received by the Court and which are not.\nThe British decision to refuse the jurisdiction of the Court in matters\ninvolving the national security of the United Kingdom, while perhaps\nprecipitated by the threat of judicial action concerning the tests of\nhydrogen bombs, is prophetic of the future.\n2\n274.

It is true that the facts in its\ndecisions show alarming gaps. In the Peter Pazmany University\nCase\n279 the Court did not have most of the documents of the written\nproceedings of the arbitral tribunal which made the decision being re-\nviewed. In the Lotus Case\n28\n0 the Court did not have the Turkish ju-\ndicial decision that gave rise to the dispute. In the case of Minority\nSchools in Albania\n28 the decision was rendered based upon many\nassumptions concerning the Albanian education situation. But if the\nCourt can be developed into a more vital force as part of the United\nNations structure, which is a major assumption, attention to its fact-\nfinding resources should receive a high priority. In particular, it may\nbe hoped that the advisory jurisdiction of the Court can be expanded,\nsince the advisory proceeding is the ideal fact-finding vehicle under\nthe present statute of the Court.\n279.

ALFORD, JR.t\nI.\nINTRODUCTION.\nT \nHE WORLD COURT is the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations Organization.' As a judicial organ, it is probably not in-\ndispensable.2 What would happen to the United Nations Organization\nwithout the Court is pure speculation. \nQuite possibly the General\nAssembly would compensate for the loss by developing judicial func-\ntions much as it has developed executive functions to offset the creep-\ning paralysis of the Security Council. Certainly the loss of the Court\nwould not mean the breakdown of all international machinery for the\npeaceful settlement of differences. But an efficient World Court may\nprove to be a major asset of the United Nations by performing three\nimportant functions. The Court can give the Organization legal guid-\nance3 and can handle certain kinds of disputes between States.\n4  \nIt\nt \nProfessor of Law, University of Virginia Law School. B.A. 1940. The Citadel;\nLL.B. 1947, University of Virginia. Portions of this Article will be incorporated into\na thesis to be submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an advanced degree\nin law at the Yale Law School.\n1. U.N. CHARTER art. 92. \"World Court\" is used henceforth to embrace the\nPermanent Court of International Justice, which functioned from 1922 to 1940, and\nthe International Court of Justice, the present court which began its work in 1946.\nThe Permanent Court was not a part of the League. The International Court of\nJustice is a part of the United Nations Organization although it has a separate\nstatute. See Hudson, The Succession of the International Court of Justice to the\nPermanent \nCourt of International \nJustice, 51 Am. J. \nINT'L L. 569 (1957).\n2. Undiscriminating laymen, particularly those who have lost lawsuits, have\nobserved from time to time that the world might be much better off without lawyers.\n3. The World Court, as of 1956, had given thirty-eight advisory opinions. All of\nthe requests to the Permanent Court of International Justice for advisory opinions\nwere made by the Council of the League. All of the requests to the International\nCourt of Justice, except one made by UNESCO, have been made by the General\nAssembly. The General Assembly, the Security Council, and other organs of the\nUnited Nations and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly to\nmake the requests, may request advisory opinions. U.N. CHARTER art. 96.\n4. Prior to World War II, state disputes were sometimes presented to the Court\nin the form of requests for advisory opinions. This practice is discussed in greater\ndetail subsequently in this Article. With some possible exceptions, such as the right\nof the United Nations to protect its employees, only a State can be a party to con-\ntentious proceedings before the Court. A respondent State cannot be brought before\nthe Court without its consent. Consent may be expressed in a special agreement\nsubmitting the case to the Court, or it may be expressed in advance of the dispute\nby acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction. The \"optional clause\" in the statute of the\nCourt provides a procedure whereby States may accept compulsory jurisdiction in\nrelation to other States accepting the same obligation in certain classes of disputes.\nThese disputes are those that are \"legal\" and which involve a question of treaty inter-\n(37)\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The legal guidance which the Court\ngives or the judgment which it renders will be a useless abstraction\nunless it is based upon actual events, formulated in the light of exist-\ning events, and designed to influence the shape of future events. The\ntendency of national courts to decide cases which are in effect hypo-\nthetical because of fact-finding lapses is dismally familiar to lawyers\nand litigants. The World Court has obstacles to the finding of facts\nwhich national courts do not encounter. The tendency of the Court\nto decide hypothetical cases therefore is stronger. The more efficient\nthe fact finding processes of the World Court become, the better are\nits opportunities to render useful decisions and give sound legal guid-\nance to the Organization.\nThe work of the Court as a creator of symbols and the relationship\nto this work of fact finding are less obvious matters. There is now\na plateau in the growth of the United Nations from which we are un-\nlikely to move without a dramatic shift in human attitudes concerning\nworld government. The problem of the Organization is somewhat\nanalogous to that of a human being who must create in his own en-\nvironment his rational fiction of what he believes himself to be. Once\nthe human being creates his fiction he feels obligated to measure up\npretation, of international law, or of the existence of any fact which if established\nwould constitute a breach of an international obligation, or of the nature or extent\nof the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation. \nSTAT.\nINT'L CT. JUST. art. 36.\nThe members of the United Nations are ipso facto parties to the statute of the\nCourt, and only parties to the statute can accept compulsory jurisdiction. Thirty-three\nacceptances of compulsory jurisdiction were in force in 1956, although most of these\nare expressly subject to a condition of reciprocity and exclude special kinds of dis-\nputes. \nThe United States declaration, for example, excludes disputes essentially\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of the United States as determined by the United\nStates. 15 DEP'T STATE BULL. 452 (1946).\nIn addition to acceptances of compulsory jurisdiction, a great many treaties made\nafter the establishment of the Permanent Court and before World War n and many\ntreaties being made at the present time provide that disputes concerning interpreta-\ntion shall be taken to the Court or that appeals may be taken to the Court from\ndecisions of arbitral tribunals which the treaties establish. The statute provides that\na reference in a treaty to the Permanent Court will be taken as a reference to the\nInternational Court of Justice. STAT. INT'L CT. JUST. art. 37.\nThe Security Council may recommend that parties to a dispute of a legal charac-\nter submit the dispute to the Court for decision. U.N. CHARTER art. 36. Whether\nStates to which such a recommendation is made are obligated to take their dispute\nbefore the Court is presently unsettled.

Not only is there now lacking any consistent demand\nfrom the people of the world that the United Nations be the focal point\nwhere national and other differences can be settled peacefully, but the\npermanent personnel of the Organization and the State officials con-\ncerned with its affairs seem to lack a sense of obligation to act boldly\nto stimulate such a demand. This is not to impugn the good intention\nor deny the manifest ability of any statesman involved. The observa-\ntion is intended only to illustrate the point that no dynamic symbol of\ninternational government has been created in the minds of men or,\napparently, is in the making. A living organization is an image in\nthe minds of men, an image of what men think the organization should\nbe rather than a collection of constitutions, by-laws, organizational\nroutines, functonaries and filing cabinets.\nIgnoring for immediate purposes the complex variables that are\ninvolved in establishing a pattern of human conduct, three basic steps\nare necessary to create a leadership symbol in the mind of a man. He\nmust be provoked to respond to a principle since a response to principle\nis more intense and enduring than a response to other stimuli. He\nmust also be permitted to respond to inconsistent principles.5 A man\nis prepared to give his primary loyalty to a leadership symbol if he\ncan reserve loyalty to secondary symbols. If loyalty to secondary sym-\nbols is not permitted, loyalty to a primary leadership symbol is never\ndeveloped or, if developed, is greatly weakened. A man stoutly resists\nslavery of his mind. It is in his mind that the defenses of self-respect\nare erected. It has been aptly remarked that a loss of self-respect is\nthe first step to treason. But a third step is also necessary to create a\nnew leadership symbol. The mind must be helped to reconcile its re-\nsponse to inconsistent principles. Some rational and acceptable ex-\nplanation must be forthcoming to justify response to a primary leader-\nship symbol while a response to other symbols is continued. New\nleadership symbols are constructed in the human mind and old symbols\nare diffused or subordinated in importance in this process of reconcil-\ning conflicting principles.\nIt is in the third basic step in developing leadership symbols that\nthe judicial system of an emerging political society usually figures so\nprominently. In England, for example, the Common Law courts ham-\nmered out the concept of a fictional and responsible Crown to which\nparamount loyalty was due. The conflicting loyalties and confused\n5.

Again, the Commerce Clause has been applied by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States to events produced by a growing industrial\nsociety in such a way that the federal government has assumed the\ndirection of economic affairs while the role of state authority has been\ncorrespondingly reduced. The task of the World Court is to create\nan image of the United Nations in the minds of men as a primary\nleadership symbol without eroding to any appreciable degree the re-\nsponse of men to State and other parochial symbols.\nThe part played by courts in developing leadership symbols in\nthe early stages of formation of a political society differs radically from\ntheir role when a political society has matured. When leadership\nsymbols have been developed and are firmly implanted, an insistence\nupon loyalty to primary leadership symbols appears to produce minor\nbut frequent shifts in attitudes concerning subordinate symbols. In\nthis situation, the minds of men are more easily manipulated through\nrepresentative bodies with flexible procedures and in close contact with\nthe daily life of a community than the courts. In the United States\nthe disorderly growth of fraternal benefit societies and business cor-\nporations after the Civil War required action by the Congress or by\nthe state legislatures. The courts could not deal with public utility\nholding companies in the Twentieth Century until the Congress enacted\nlegislation for that purpose.

It is the drive for resolu-\ntion of conflict that provides the incentive for the formation of new\npolitical societies. As a principal resolver of conflict, the adjudicator\nhas always been an obvious choice, for it is in its courts that an emerg-\ning government has its closest contact with the governed. But a court\nin an inchoate political system must be more than the simple adjudi-\n6. The term \"interstitial\" is used here in the sense that the Court functions as an\nauxiliary to institutions which are charged with the continuous making, undoing and\nremaking of policies that the management of a complex community requires. The\nCourt, of course, creates conditions under which policies are made by other institu-\ntions, but it does this spasmodically without clear cut policing of the effects of its\ndecisions and consequent necessary adjustments.\n[VOL. 4: p. 37\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

We are not now concerned\nwith the role of the World Court in a matured political society. That\nproblem can be faced many generations hence by people better prepared\nto deal with it.\nThe Court established at San Francisco in 1945 is primarily an\nadjudicating institution in the \"national\" sense.8 The statute of the\nCourt is almost the same as that of the Permanent Court of Interna-\ntional Justice with which it maintains, practically speaking, an un-\nbroken tradition and skein of experience. To the ordinary man, 9 the\nman whose influence will determine ultimately whether there will be\neffective international organization or not, the World Court is as re-\nmote as the Supreme Court of Saturn. The statute of the Court can\nbe formally amended only in the manner provided for amendment of\nthe Charter of the United Nations.' \u00b0 Neither the statute nor the charter\nare likely to be amended at any time in the foreseeable future. What\ncan be done to utilize the Court in such a way that its work will en-\nhance the appeal of the United Nations to the \"mass mind\" as a leader-\nship symbol and thus increase the prestige and effective action of the\nOrganization at a time when effective action is sorely needed? How\ncan this be done without amending formally the statute of the Court?\nThe writer does not pretend to have pat answers to either of these\nquestions, and doubts that anyone does.

In certain rare instances individuals have had an opportunity to get their\ncases before the Court. In Danzig Legislative Decrees, P.C.I.J., Ser. A/B, No. 65\n(advisory opinion 1935), the Court considered a dispute concerning a statute enacted\nby the Danzig Senate applying the criminal law doctrine of analogy. The Court deter-\nmined that the Free City of Danzig should have State status for this proceeding.\nThis meant, in effect, that the Court would hear only one side of the case since the\nSenate represented the Free City and the Senate was Nazi-controlled.

Some facts must be avail-\nable to the fact-finder in the beginning to enable him to appraise his\nfact-finding task. Who are the fact finders of the World Court? Why\nare they looking for facts? What facts are they looking for? How\nis a flow of basic information necessary for the appraisal process main-\ntained to the Court and the people who appear before it? What legal\ndoctrines condition their access to this information and their use of it ?\"6\nHow are fact-finding missions allocated once the intelligence task\nis appraised? Whose decisions determine the allocation? To what\nextent does the allocation of the fact-finding task condition the facts\navailable to the Court for decision?\nOnce the fact-finding task is determined and missions allocated,\nhow is the actual surveillance executed? What legal doctrines deter-\nmine the facts that will get before the Court and those that will not?\nWhose decisions determine what facts will be considered and what\nfacts ignored?\nThese are some of the questions that ought to be asked about the\nfact-finding functions of the World Court. This Article does not pur-\nport to answer all of them. The conclusions which international courts\nare prepared to draw from facts embrace most of the traditional doctrine\nof international law.

In con-\ntentious proceedings in which one State party has a national on the\nCourt, the appointment of an ad hoc judge may offset his vote.\n2 9 A\n19.

The present practice of the Court appears to be liberal except\nwith respect to service upon arbitral tribunals or commissions. There\nis, for example, no incompatibility between the function of judge and\nacting as chairman of an ad hoc committee set up by the General\nAssembly with a view to finding a humanitarian solution to the prob-\nlem of prisoners of war.\"\n8 On the other hand, any function which\ncompels a judge to follow the instructions of his government, regard-\nless of his personal views, is political. This includes the position of\ndelegate for a government to the International Labor Conference. 64\nThe principle applied by the Permanent Court to determine the in-\ncompatibility of the function of judge and service on an arbitral tri-\nbunal was, originally, whether the agreement upon which the arbi-\ntration was based provided for an appeal to the Court or settlement\nby the Court in case the arbitration failed. 5 At a later date this\nprinciple was abandoned upon the assumption that the judge could\nbe disqualified if the case ultimately came before the Court.66\nThe International Court of Justice has applied a principle more\nrestrictive than that established originally by the Permanent Court.\nA judge may not accept the functions of arbitrator, chairman of a\ncommission of conciliation or inquiry, or any similar function, if there\nis any provision to the effect that a decision taken by him, or one\nin which he has taken part, may be the subject of an application to\nthe Court or if there is a possibility that the decision may be the sub-\nject of an application.6\"\nThe judges of the World Court should be encouraged to par-\nticipate actively in international affairs collateral to their duties upon\nthe Court. In this activity the judge may develop \"background\" in-\nformation that will enhance his ability to find facts while performing\nhis judicial duties.

Treaties\nsometimes provide for appointment by the President of the Court of\narbitrators, umpires or members of conciliation commissions. Thus,\nthe Treaty of Lausanne provided for appointment of the President of\nthe Mixed Arbitral Tribunals by the President of the Court if the\nparties could not agree upon a selection. The President performed\nthis function in 1924 by appointing a President for the Greco-Turkish\nand Romano-Turkish Tribunals. 9 Special requests are sometimes made\nby States or international organizations for appointments to fill special\noffices. In 1954 the President nominated a Chairman for a Special\nAdvisory Board appointed by the Secretary-General of the United\nNations.7\" Requests are also made by corporations to appoint arbi-\ntrators to settle contract disputes and these requests are usually granted.\nCertain appointments, quite certainly, have no potential value to\nthe Court as information sources.7 \nBut in other instances, such as an\nappointment of members of a conciliation commission or arbitral board,\nthe appointment could be conditioned upon reports by the member\nconcerned or upon his willingness to testify or produce evidence be-\nfore the Court if later called upon. The President is usually approached\nand his consent secured before the treaty provision or special request\nfor appointment is made. The appointing practice does seem to be a\nbud from which increased efficiency in finding facts could quickly flower.\nIII.\nALLOCATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE TASK.\nJudge Hudson, in his careful and distinguished treatment of the\nwork of the Permanent Court of International Justice, states: \"Issues\nof fact are seldom tried before the Court, and where a question ot\nfact arises the Court must usually base its finding on statements made\non behalf of the parties either in the documents of the written pro-\nthe Court have general diplomatic immunity in the Netherlands.

The\nburden is on the opponent to produce the facts and, if he can be kept\nfrom getting them in, so much the better for the client. The practice\nhas been tolerated not only because of the lawyer's affection for tradi-\ntion but because the judge does not have the time to set out upon ex-\ntensive fact-finding inquiries of his own. The judge is an umpire at\ntrial. The judge on appeal tends to accept the facts produced at trial.\nThere is no reason why this situation should exist in cases brought\nbefore the World Court. The General List of the Court is not over-\ncrowded and the judges, or at least most of them, are not imbued with\nAnglo-American legal traditions. Why are the parties allowed to per-\nform the major fact-finding function before the World Court? Who\nmakes the decisions which determine who finds the facts?\nThe statute of the Court sets forth the major outlines of the\nfact-finding missions which the Court can pursue. Since the statute\nis based upon State consent and State consent pervades the entire\nproblem of the Court's jurisdiction, it is understandable that special\ndeference should be shown to the statements made by State repre-\nsentatives and the facts produced by them. Nevertheless, in spite of\nthe very real obstacle that State consent presents in fact-finding, this\nsingle factor cannot explain why the Court has not moved with greater\nfreedom in finding facts within the confines that its statute establishes.\nTwo factors appear to account for the reticence of the Court,\nparticularly in contentious cases, to make independent inquiries. The\nCourt has been prone to regard executive-administrative findings-of-\nfact as conclusive because of the limitations set by the statute upon\nits own fact-finding activities. This predisposition has carried over\ninto contentious litigation, the State being treated as an administrative\nfact-finder whose conclusions must be accepted at face value unless\nmanifestly questionable. Likewise, in the history of the Permanent\nCourt, there were efforts to use the Court as a fact-finding institution\nfor the League and other international organizations. This resulted in\nresistence within the Court to any extension of judicial fact-finding\nactivity.\n72.

The Notion of Executive-Administrative Finality.\nIn the Anglo-American and Civil Law judicial systems the theory\nof finality of administrative and legislative findings-of-fact has been\nfirmly implanted. The theory may be based upon constitutional sepa-\nration of powers, upon a need for efficiency in sifting voluminous facts\nor upon the inability of the Court to appraise remote events. It is\nunderstandable that judges trained in the Anglo-American and Civil\nLaw systems should tend to apply these theories to the work of the\nWorld Court. There is also more justification for the application of\ntheories of finality when the fact-finding ability of the Court is sub-\nstantially curtailed. The Court has no processes to compel the pro-\nduction of evidence. It may request of public international organiza-\ntions information relative to cases before it,73 and may call upon the\nagents to produce any document or supply any explanation. 7\n4 Relevant\nquestions may be put to witnesses and experts.7\n3 But the Court must\ndepend upon the consent of States to produce witnesses or permit the\nmaking of inquiries on the spot.76 Requests for advisory opinions\nmust be accompanied by all documents \"likely to throw light\" upon\nthe question. 77\nLacking the necessary power to compel the production of the\nevidence it may need, the Court tends to rely heavily upofi the evidence\nsubmitted without positive efforts to police the truth of the facts. In\nthe case of The Prince of Pless,7\n8 Poland maintained that the German\napplication was inadmissible so long as the Prince had failed to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies in Poland. The Court found it unnecessary\nto pass upon the issue of exhaustion of remedies: \"Since in any event\nit will certainly be an advantage to the Court, as regards the points\nwhich have to be established in the case, to be acquainted with the final\ndecision of the Supreme Polish Administrative Tribunal upon the\nappeals brought by the Prince von Pless and now pending before that\ntribunal and .. .the Court must therefore arrange its procedure so\nas to insure that this will be possible.

In a series of cases, the first group involving Polish claims\nto certain functions within the City and access to port facilities and\nthe second rising out of Nazi party activity within the City, the Council\nthrew administrative problems into the lap of the Court that probably\ncould and should have been solved by the Council and High Commis-\nsioner without judicial action. 5 There was also a tendency to try to\nthrust upon the Court some of the fact-finding problems of the Mixed\nCommission for the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations under\nthe Convention of Lausanne. The Court dutifully complied with the\nrequests for aid in the Danzig cases, although in Danzig Legislative\nDecrees, Judge Anzilotti remarked:\n\"All that can be said is that the reason why the Council asked\nfor the Court's opinion was because it desired to be informed as\nto the scope and effects of certain provisions of the Danzig Con-\nstitution and of certain acts of the Senate, in order to enable it\nto exercise the guarantees of the League of Nations. Now al-\nthough it is the right and obligation of the Council to obtain any\ninformation which it considers useful or necessary, it is equally\ntrue that it must do this by appropriate methods, and must not\nseek to impose on the Court duties different from those for which\nit was created and organized.\"8 6\nWith respect to inquiries by the Mixed Commission, however, the\nCourt assumed a different attitude. In Exchange of Greek and Turkish\nPopulations7 the Mixed Commission induced the Council of the League\nto seek the opinion of the Court on the questions:\n\"What meaning and scope should be attributed to the word\n'established' in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lausanne . . . in regard\nto which discussions have arisen and arguments have been put\nforward which are contained in the documents communicated\nby the Mixed Commission?

The Court could not concern itself with this matter.92\nC. Allocation of the Intelligence Task in Contentious Cases.\nUpon the assumption that the Court might be prepared in some\ncontentious cases to make independent inquiries into facts, what oppor-\ntunities for independent inquiry are open to the Court? At the present\ntime, the Court seems to take it for granted that if the parties are in\nagreement on the facts, the facts agreed upon will be taken as the\nbasis of the decision. In this situation the State parties determine\nthe allocation of intelligence tasks.\nThe likelihood of a dispute as to facts is fairly remote. This is\nnot because the parties are anxious to quickly reach a peaceful solu-\ntion but simply because neither party has enough facts to question\nthe facts submitted by the other. Records may be lost, the events in\nquestion may have occurred within the territory of one of the parties,\nor the case might be pitched on events long passed. When the facts\ndo get into dispute in the usual proceeding on the merits it is because\none of the parties by espionage or other informal practices has suc-\nceeded in penetrating the barriers to the flow of information established\nby the other.\nIn the Oscar Chinn Case\n93 the British were unable to dispute the\nBelgian allegations of fact concerning the de facto monopoly alleged\nby the British because the evidence the British needed was in the\nBelgian Congo. The British had no access to the facts and the Court\nwas not prepared to get the facts for them. In the Nottebohm Case\n94\nGuatemala could not make an issue of fact concerning the alleged fraud\nof Nottebohm in obtaining Liechtenstein nationality because it could\nnot have access to the necessary records in Liechtenstein. In the\nCorfu Channel Case the British took the necessary evidence to raise\nan issue of fact with Albania by sweeping mines in the Corfu Channel\nover Albania's protest.

If the Court is confronted with a dispute of fact, the dispute\ntends to be eased upon information obtained informally so that the\nCourt is likely to have difficulty in any investigation it undertakes.\nIf the facts are not disputed by the parties, there are several\nsituations in contentious proceedings in which the Court might see\nfit to make independent inquiries but has not yet done so to any appre-\nciable extent. In a number of contentious cases the Court must hear a\npreliminary objection to its jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.\nThe Court determines its own jurisdiction but clearly cannot do so\nunless some of the facts of the case are considered. The Court has\ntaken a pragmatic approach to the problem by holding that if an ex-\ncursion. into facts is necessary on the issue of jurisdiction, the facts\nwill be considered de novo on the merits. 5 This is painless dentistry.\nIf a State appears to raise the issue of jurisdiction and is not coopera-\ntive in producing facts, the Court may take the position that it is free\nto investigate for the limited purpose of determining its jurisdiction.\nNo institution other than the Court can determine jurisdiction and\nthe question of jurisdiction must be answered. 6\nThe Court may request information from public international\norganizations relative to cases before it.9\nT  This may be done at the\ninitiative of the Court or at the request of one of the parties.\" \nThe\nprivilege to request information applies to advisory as well as con-\ntentious proceedings and would seem to apply to proceedings upon\npreliminary objections as well as to proceedings on the merits.\nA State not originally a party to contentious litigation may inter-\nvene. This may inject new facts and create a dispute. A State may\nintervene as a matter of right if a convention to which it is a party\nis being construed.99 It may intervene with Court consent if it has\na legal interest which might be affected adversely by the decision. 1\n00\n95.

In the Case of Interpretation\nof Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (The Chorzow Factory),\"9 the Court\nagreed to interpret a passage in Judgment No. 7: \"If Poland wishes\nto dispute the validity of this entry, it can, in any case, only be an-\nnulled in pursuance of a decision given by the competent tribunal.\"\nPoland had contended that the land-book entry was invalid, and, after\nthe judgment, commenced a proceeding before the Tribunal of Kato-\nwice to annul it. The Court was required to interpret the passage in\nJudgment No. 7 in the light of the supervening act by Poland in com-\nmencing annulment proceedings before its own tribunal. The super-\nvening act provoked the request for interpretation.\nHow far the Court will consider new facts in the guise of in-\nterpretation is presently an open question. Clearly the Court will not\nentertain a new line of factual argument not originally submitted.\nThus in the Columbian-Peruvian \nAsylum Case\"' Columbia presented\nan abstract question whether Columbia was \"competent, as the country\nto qualify the offense for the purpose of said asylum.\" The Court\nanswered the question in the abstract: Columbia did not have a right\nto qualify the nature of the offense by a unilateral and definitive de-\ncision binding on Peru. But the Court held that there was no urgency\njustifying the asylum, although Mr. de la Torre, the refugee in ques-\ntion, was not a common criminal as contended by Peru. While this\ndecision disposed of an abstract question presented by Columbia, it\ndid not dispose of Mr. de la Torre who was still in the Columbian\nembassy at Lima. On the day the judgment was rendered, Columbia\nrequested an interpretation. The Court refused to give this inter-\npretation, noting that it had not passed on the issue whether Colum-\nbia's qualification was in fact correct. The purpose of the request must\n117. STAT.

There can be no revision more than\nten years after the date of judgment. The application for revision must\nbe made within six months after discovery of the fact. The fact must\nbe a decisive factor. It must have been unknown to the Court at the\ntime of the decision and also unknown at that time to the party claim-\ning revision. The party cannot claim revision if its ignorance was\ndue to negligence. There have been no cases of revision by the Court\nand there are unlikely to be any unless the statute is substantially\nmodified.\n2 3\nD. Allocation of the Intelligence Task in Advisory Cases.\nIn contrast to the restricted rule of the Court in allocating fact-\nfinding missions in contentious cases, in advisory cases the ultimate\ndecision as to who finds what facts and where the facts are to be found\nrests with the Court. There are several reasons for this. The most\nimportant reason is that the statute of the Court places no substantial\nlimits upon its activity in advisory cases.'24 Also, while advisory de-\ncisions may be binding in a moral sense and are usually accepted by\nthe organizations or States concerned, the advisory decision is bind-\ning in a legal sense only when the parties have agreed by treaty or\nconvention that the advisory opinion is to bind.'25 States have little\nto lose and much to gain by participating in advisory proceedings. The\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly may request advisory\nopinions. \nLikewise other organs of the United Nations and the\nspecialized agencies may make the requests when authorized by the\nGeneral Assembly. 26 A State cannot request an advisory opinion di-\nrectly but may be able to persuade the General Assembly or some other\norganization authorized to seek advisory opinions to make the request\n121.

This\nis one of the sensitive issues before the Court today.\nThe present position of the Court appears to be as follows: The\nCourt is entitled to withhold an advisory opinion and will do so if its\nopinion requires a decision directly upon the merits of a State dispute\nand one or more of the States concerned do not participate in the\nproceeding. This may also be the case when the States participate in\nthe proceeding, but a request for an opinion should not in principle\nbe refused.' 83 When the opinion relates to legal grounds actually pend-\ning between States, the opinion has no binding force. However, no\nState, whether a member of the United Nations or not, can prevent\nthe giving of an advisory opinion which the United Nations deems\ndesirable for its guidance.\" 4 The Court is not concerned with the\npolitical motive of the General Assembly in submitting a request for\nan opinion.\"' The Court is the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations and will function accordingly. The rules provide that if the\nrequest for an advisory opinion relates to legal questions actually\npending between States the provisions of the statute relating to ad hoc\njudges shall apply.\" 6 In applying the provisions of the statute re-\nlating to contentious proceedings to advisory proceedings the Court\nhas stated that it will \"above all consider whether the advisory opinion\nrelates to a legal question actually pending between two or more\nStates.\"' 8\nSince 1946, the General Assembly, which has requested all except\none of the advisory opinions, has presented its questions in abstract\nform. In at least one instance the question was so abstract that the\nCourt could not answer it directly. This tactic of the General Assembly\nhas not prevented States from appearing and attacking the jurisdic-\ntion of the Court. 1 3\n8\nThe judges likewise must consider the experience of the Perma-\nnent Court in \"advisory arbitration.\" '\n'  \nThe League Covenant pro-\nvided that the Court could give an advisory opinion upon any dispute\n133.

But upon\nthe assumption that the Court will decide to make independent in-\nquiries, how does the Court make them?\nThe rest of this article deals with four major problems produced\nby surveillance practices: procuring and use of testimony by witnesses;\nuse of expert inquiries; rules of evidence; and State security restric-\ntions. No effort is made to discuss rules of evidence exhaustively\nsince several excellent treatments of this subject are now in print.'45\nThere have been few contentious cases before the Court in which\nthe parties have disputed the facts. Of these, the Corfu Channel Case\nsheds more light upon the difficulties of independent inquiry by the\nCourt than any other. The case is a judicial landmark and figures\nprominently in the subsequent discussion. 146\n145. SANDIER, EVIDENCE BEFORE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS \n(1939); WITN-\nBERG, La Theorie des Preuves devant les Jurisdictions Internationales, 56 HAGUE\nREcuEIL 5 (1936).\n146. In view of numerous references to this case in the subsequent materials the\nfacts of the case are stated briefly here. On October 22, 1946, two British destroyers,\nH.M.S. \"Saumarez\" and H.M.S. \"Volage\" struck mines while passing through the\nfairway of the Corfu Channel. These vessels were part of a squadron passing through\nthe Channel subject to secret British orders X.C.U. Upon receipt of the report of the\nmining, the Central International Mine Clearance Board recommended that the\nchannel be reswept at a favorable opportunity (the channel having been swept prior\nto October 1946), but stated that the sweeping of the channel remained an issue out-\nside its scope. The British nevertheless swept the channel on the 12th and 13th of\nNovember, 1946 (Operation Retail). A member of the Mediterranean Mine Clearance\nBoard, Commander Mestre, attended the sweeping as an observer. Two German G-Y\nmines were recovered and taken to Malta for inspection. Diplomatic negotiations with\nAlbania having failed, the British took the case before the Security Council under\nArticle 35 of the Charter. Albania accepted an invitation to attend the Security\nCouncil proceedings upon condition of her acceptance, for the purposes of the dispute,\nof the obligations of a member of the United Nations. The Security Council appointed\na subcommittee to investigate the facts, and the report of this committee was con-\nsidered by the Council. Ultimately, a finding by the Council adverse to Albania was\nblocked by the veto, but a British resolution referred the case to the World Court.\nThe British brought the case before the Court by application, and Albania raised a\npreliminary question of jurisdiction on the ground that the case should have been\nsubmitted by special agreement. The Court decided that it was unnecessary to pass\nupon this issue because Albania had voluntarily accepted its jurisdiction by a letter of\nJuly 2, 1947. Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection), Judgment of March 25,\n1948, [1947-48] I.C.J. Rep. 15.\nImmediately after this decision the case was submitted by special agreement. The\nclaim of the United Kingdom in this agreement was Albanian responsibility for the\nexplosions and liability for the resulting damages. The British case was that the\nmines were laid by Yugoslavia with Albanian connivance or that Albania knew the\nmines had been laid and failed to give notice as required by international law. Albania\ncounterclaimed that the United Kingdom had violated her sovereignty on October 22,\n1946, not having been in innocent passage, and had again violated her sovereignty in\nOperation Retail on the 12th and 13th of November 1946. After hearing witnesses\nand directing an expert inquiry on the spot, the Court gave judgment for the British\non their claim on the ground that Albania knew or should have known of the mining\nand failed to give warning; the court gave judgment for Albania on that part of her\ncounterclaim pertaining to Operation Retail. The Court determined the indemnity in\na separate proceeding in which Albania refused to participate. A second committee of\nexperts was formed to aid the Court in determining the indemnity due.

In the Corfu\nChannel Case a reasonable ground for refusal to testify was respected\nby the Court. Thus, Commander Kovacic refused to disclose the\nname of the Yugoslav who told him that Sub-Lieutenant Drago\nBlazevic had said that the Yugoslav minelayers placed mines in the\nCorfu Channel. The question was withdrawn by M. Cot.1\n8 9  Com-\nmander Paul refused to answer a question by the President of the\nCourt concerning the British secret Order X.C.U.' 90 \nCommander\nLankester likewise refused to answer a question by M.

The efficiency of examination of witnesses and the care\nin recording testimony is in marked contrast to the first efforts in\nGerman Interests in Upper Silesia. It is likely that the Court will not\nresort to the taking of depositions. This common practice in arbitral\nproceedings would deprive the Court of an opportunity to observe\nthe demeanor of the witness and to put its own questions.

The flexibility of the Court's\nprocedures are well illustrated by the examination of Commander\nKovacic. The features which would enhance the effectiveness of the\nuse of testimony will require changes in the statute or the conclusion\nof a special convention. The Court needs the authority to compel the\nproduction of witnesses or at least the States should undertake to enact\nnational laws for the production of needed witnesses and documents.\nIt is also desirable that a witness be given immunity for testimony\noffered before the Court.

The Court appar-\nently reached its decision to appoint experts during or after the testi-\nmony of Admiral Moullec which, in conjunction with Yugoslav docu-\nments, cast doubt upon some of the testimony of Commander Kovacic.\nBy the Court Order of December 17, 1948, Commodore J. Bull\nof Norway, Commodore S. A. Forshell of Sweden and Lieut. Com-\nmander S. J. W. Elfferich of the Netherlands were appointed as ex-\nperts to give the Court \"a precise and concrete opinion\" upon the ques-\ntions presented and the reasons for their findings. In its general ad-\nministrative details the order was similar to the one issued in ,the\nChorzow Case.\n2\"' \nThe questions presented to the experts, however,\nwent to the critical issues of the case. The experts were to examine\nspecified evidence to render an opinion as to what conclusions could\nbe drawn concerning the type mine that injured the vessels, whether\nthe mines were laid methodically, the purpose for which they were laid\nand when they were laid. The experts were also to give an opinion\nwhether from the evidence Commander Kovacic could have seen G.Y.\nmines being loaded upon the Yugoslav minelayers in Panikovac Cove,\nhow many G.Y. mines such a minelayer could carry and how long it\nwould take to load them with the facilities available. The experts\nwere requested to state an opinion on the main issue, the means em-\nployed to lay the minefield and whether the field could be laid without\nAlbanian authorities being aware of it.\n21 \u00b0\nThe experts elected Commodore Bull as chairman, considered\nthe evidence and submitted their unanimous report on January 8,\n1949.\"' \nThe experts concluded that the vessels had been damaged\nby German G.Y. mines such as those recovered in \"Operation Retail,\"\nthat the field was laid methodically with an offensive-defensive object\n(to stop ships from passing through the channel and prevent their\nentry into Saranda Bay) and that the mines recovered had been in\nthe water a short time, but that no precise date could be established\nfor the laying of the field. The experts stated a number of possible\nalternatives concerning the observations of Commander Kovacic but\nwere unable to give a definite answer.

In the Corfu Channel Case\nevidence was admitted which had been obtained by espionage.224 Part\nof the key evidence in the British case had been obtained by the in-\nternational equivalent of an \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" After\nthe mining incident of October 22, 1946, the British swept the Corfu\nchannel in \"Operation Retail\" (November 1946) over the protest of\nAlbania. Twenty-two mines were cut and two mines, which proved\nto be German mines of the G.Y. type, were recovered and taken to\nMalta. The mines appeared to have been laid a short time before\nthe incident of 22 October. The Court admitted evidence obtained\nfrom examination of the mines and related technical details. In answer\nto Albania's counterclaim that the United Kingdom had violated her\nsovereignty in \"Operation Retail,\" the British argued that they were\nsecuring evidence for the Court which might have been lost if the\nmines had been removed by Albania or had been equipped with auto-\nmatic flooding devices. The British also argued that self help justified\ntheir action. Both arguments were rejected by the Court and the United\nKingdom was held liable on the counterclaim. The evidence obtained,\nhowever, formed part of the basis for the decision of the Court that\nAlbania was liable to the United Kingdom on the British claim.\nAn exclusion of evidence by the Court based upon the way in\nwhich it was secured would be unrealistic in view of the known barriers\nestablished by States to the flow of information. The Court is not\nfaced with the problem of intermittent police abuses of individuals\nwhich national constitutional guarantees are designed to minimize.\nThe Court must get its evidence when and by whatever means it can\nobtain it.\n223.

A special hearing was held to determine whether\nthe documents should be admitted. During the hearing, the Albanian\ncounsel, in violation of the President's instructions, gave a resume\nof the documents which he wished to introduce. The British agent\ncontended that the resume was inaccurate and gave his own resume.\nThe President reprimanded both representatives in open court.2\n3 4 The\nCourt subsequently admitted the documents. There was little else\nthat could be done.\nIt has been customary in contentious proceedings for the Presi-\ndent to announce before closing that the Court reserves the right to\nrequest the parties to furnish additional explanations or information.\nDuring its twenty-second session the Permanent Court requested an\nagent to submit a document. The hearing was concluded before the\ndocument was submitted. The questions then arose whether the Court\ncould maintain the request since it could use information only after\nit had been communicated to the interested parties and would have\nto hold a hearing if a party objected. The President stated the Court\nwould accept the document without committing himself to the pro-\ncedure to be followed. 2 5\nThe advisory proceedings present no problem as to time limitations\nin filing evidence, all material produced being for the information of\nthe Court and the decision having no binding effect.\n(3.) \nBurden of Proof.\nThe burden of proof rule applied by the Court is the simple formula\nof the Civil Law.

In some\ninstances it is difficult to determine which State is plaintiff and which\ndefendant. The Court also may make independent findings of fact.\nIn the Corfu Channel Case the United Kingdom admitted it bore the\nburden of proof of Albanian complicity but argued that the burden\nwould be discharged by satisfying the Court of Albanian complicity\nwith reasonable certainty. The British further argued that the burden\nof going forward with the evidence was shifted to Albania because\nAlbania had exclusive control of its territorial waters and adjacent\nland and knowledge of the events preceding the mining was likely to\nbe confined to her government. 2\n38  Albania appeared to admit the\nburden of proof on her counter-claim but argued that the British bore\nthe burden of proof on their defenses of innocent passage, securing\nevidence for the Court and self help.2 3\n9 The British answered that,\nassuming the Albanian contention was true, once the British established\nthe principle of their exception, the burden would shift to Albania to\nshow that the British had exceeded their rights. The Court rejected\nthe British argument that exclusive control and special knowledge\nby Albania shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence on\nthe issue of complicity.\n24\u00b0 The Court ruled in favor of Albania on\nthat part of its counterclaim pertaining to \"Operation Retail\" and\nthus did not pass upon the issue whether, if the British could have\nproved their exception, the burden of going forward with the evidence\non the issue of unreasonable exercise of the British rights would have\nshifted.\nIn the Minquiers and Erechos Case\n241 the special agreement be-\ntween France and the United Kingdom stated their intent as to the\npresentation of pleadings without prejudice to any question as to the\nburden of proof. The Court, considering the positions of the parties,\nboth claiming sovereignty over the same territory, and the question\nof title that was in issue, decided that each party must prove its own\ntitle and the facts upon which it relied.\nThe International Court of Justice has had little occasion to dis-\ncuss questions of burden of proof.242 The Permanent Court likewise\n238. 3 CORFU CHANNEL CASE -\nPLEADINGS, ORAL ARGUMENTS, AND DOCUMENTS\n220, 250 (I.C.J. 1948).\n239. 3 id. at 405, 406.\n240.

Judicial \nNotice.\nThe judges of the Court often bring to a case facts that have not,\nstrictly speaking, been introduced in evidence. In the nature of the\nwork of the judges of the Court and in view of the kind of case with\nwhich the Court deals, the judge cannot be a stranger to a case in\nthe sense that a judge of a national court may hear a case for the\nfirst time when it is argued before him. By its statute the Court is\nnot restricted to the evidence produced by the parties. Informal con-\ntributions by the judges are inevitable and desirable. Thus, while\nthe Court has had occasion to take judicial notice of certain facts,\njudicial notice has been used more often to describe the things that\nthe Court will not consider without proof. For example, the Court\nhas stated that it will not take notice of a municipal law but will obtain\nknowledge of it with the aid of the parties or by inquiries by the\nCourt.\n244 On the other hand, the Court will take notice of treaties\nand administrative acts relating to them.245 The Court will also take\nnotice of historical events2\n40 and publicized contemporary political\nsituations.\n247\n(5.) \nCircumstantial Evidence -\nAdverse Presumptions.\nThe Court has dealt with circumstantial evidence in a number\nof cases. 48 In the Corfu Channel Case the Court based its decision on\nthe British claim upon circumstantial evidence and thus found it neces-\nsary to discuss the matter in detail.

It must be regarded as of\nspecial weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together\nand leading logically to a single conclusion.\"24 \nThe Court considered\nproof of Albanian knowledge of the mining could be drawn from in-\nferences of fact provided they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\nFrom the attitude of Albania before and after the mining incident\nin conjunction with the information furnished by its experts, the Court\nconcluded that Albania must have had knowledge of the mining.\n25\u00b0\nThe World Court appears unwilling to draw inferences from the\nnon-production of documents, although the statute indicates that the\nCourt may take formal notice of a refusal to produce.2 ' In the Corfu\nChannel Case the Court was urged to infer from the refusal of the\nBritish to produce Order X.C.U., which related to the passage of the\nCorfu Strait on 22 October 1946, that the order contained instruc-\ntions to reconnoiter the Albanian Coast. \nThe Court refused to\ndraw conclusions differing from those to which the actual events gave\nrise.52 The use of adverse presumptions might provide an effective\nsanction for the production of documents. 5 3\nD.

The report\nwas submitted to the Court as a photograph of an edited document.\nIn order to prove that the document had been edited, the British found\nit necessary to introduce a photograph of the un-edited document which\nat the time was still classified as secret.\n254.

In support of\nthis claim they relied upon a report of the Captain of the \"Volage,\"\none of the damaged vessels, in which it was stated that the Albanian\ndefenses had been studied at close range and that the information was\nincluded with reference to X.C.U.

In\n1926, President Huber proposed a new rule of Court placing the\nresponsibility on the party which introduced the secret information\nand allowing the opposing party to demand a private hearing.26 9 The\nproposal met with much opposition from the Court on the ground that\nit was superfluous and perhaps dangerous since the parties acting\ntogether might produce any information they saw fit. The consensus\nof the Court appeared to be that the State producing the information\nwas responsible in principle and that the Court could exclude evidence\nwhich it could not properly take into account and make public.\n2 7\n0\nResistance to the jurisdiction of the Court or obstruction of its\nfact gathering processes on security grounds is a more serious matter.\nThe principal difficulty encountered by the Permanent Court was in\nobtaining preparatory materials used for the Versailles Conference.271\nIn his dissenting opinion in the Oscar Chinn Case, Judge Van Eysinga\nnoted:\n\"The undersigned cannot refrain in this connection from\nexpressing his regret that the Court should frequently be called\nupon to give decisions in regard to collective conventions con-\ncluded after the Great War without having at its disposal the rec-\nords of the meetings at which these conventions were elaborated,\nthese records being kept secret. The resulting lack of information\nhas more than once made itself felt in the present case.\n272\nThe security restrictions proved an embarrassment even in those\ncases in which one of the parties offered to produce the necessary\nmaterials. In The Jurisdiction of the European Commission of the\nDanube\n271 the agent of one of the States cited certain records of the\npreparation of the Versailles treaty. Counsel for another State ob-\njected to the use of the records in evidence because they were secret.\nOne of the States interested in the proceeding offered to supply the\nrecords in question.

It is true that the facts in its\ndecisions show alarming gaps. In the Peter Pazmany University\nCase\n279 the Court did not have most of the documents of the written\nproceedings of the arbitral tribunal which made the decision being re-\nviewed. In the Lotus Case\n28\n0 the Court did not have the Turkish ju-\ndicial decision that gave rise to the dispute. In the case of Minority\nSchools in Albania\n28 the decision was rendered based upon many\nassumptions concerning the Albanian education situation. But if the\nCourt can be developed into a more vital force as part of the United\nNations structure, which is a major assumption, attention to its fact-\nfinding resources should receive a high priority. In particular, it may\nbe hoped that the advisory jurisdiction of the Court can be expanded,\nsince the advisory proceeding is the ideal fact-finding vehicle under\nthe present statute of the Court.\n279.

ALFORD, JR.t\nI.\nINTRODUCTION.\nT \nHE WORLD COURT is the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations Organization.' As a judicial organ, it is probably not in-\ndispensable.2 What would happen to the United Nations Organization\nwithout the Court is pure speculation. \nQuite possibly the General\nAssembly would compensate for the loss by developing judicial func-\ntions much as it has developed executive functions to offset the creep-\ning paralysis of the Security Council. Certainly the loss of the Court\nwould not mean the breakdown of all international machinery for the\npeaceful settlement of differences. But an efficient World Court may\nprove to be a major asset of the United Nations by performing three\nimportant functions. The Court can give the Organization legal guid-\nance3 and can handle certain kinds of disputes between States.\n4  \nIt\nt \nProfessor of Law, University of Virginia Law School. B.A. 1940. The Citadel;\nLL.B. 1947, University of Virginia. Portions of this Article will be incorporated into\na thesis to be submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an advanced degree\nin law at the Yale Law School.\n1. U.N. CHARTER art. 92. \"World Court\" is used henceforth to embrace the\nPermanent Court of International Justice, which functioned from 1922 to 1940, and\nthe International Court of Justice, the present court which began its work in 1946.\nThe Permanent Court was not a part of the League. The International Court of\nJustice is a part of the United Nations Organization although it has a separate\nstatute. See Hudson, The Succession of the International Court of Justice to the\nPermanent \nCourt of International \nJustice, 51 Am. J. \nINT'L L. 569 (1957).\n2. Undiscriminating laymen, particularly those who have lost lawsuits, have\nobserved from time to time that the world might be much better off without lawyers.\n3. The World Court, as of 1956, had given thirty-eight advisory opinions. All of\nthe requests to the Permanent Court of International Justice for advisory opinions\nwere made by the Council of the League. All of the requests to the International\nCourt of Justice, except one made by UNESCO, have been made by the General\nAssembly. The General Assembly, the Security Council, and other organs of the\nUnited Nations and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly to\nmake the requests, may request advisory opinions. U.N. CHARTER art. 96.\n4. Prior to World War II, state disputes were sometimes presented to the Court\nin the form of requests for advisory opinions. This practice is discussed in greater\ndetail subsequently in this Article. With some possible exceptions, such as the right\nof the United Nations to protect its employees, only a State can be a party to con-\ntentious proceedings before the Court. A respondent State cannot be brought before\nthe Court without its consent. Consent may be expressed in a special agreement\nsubmitting the case to the Court, or it may be expressed in advance of the dispute\nby acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction. The \"optional clause\" in the statute of the\nCourt provides a procedure whereby States may accept compulsory jurisdiction in\nrelation to other States accepting the same obligation in certain classes of disputes.\nThese disputes are those that are \"legal\" and which involve a question of treaty inter-\n(37)\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The legal guidance which the Court\ngives or the judgment which it renders will be a useless abstraction\nunless it is based upon actual events, formulated in the light of exist-\ning events, and designed to influence the shape of future events. The\ntendency of national courts to decide cases which are in effect hypo-\nthetical because of fact-finding lapses is dismally familiar to lawyers\nand litigants. The World Court has obstacles to the finding of facts\nwhich national courts do not encounter. The tendency of the Court\nto decide hypothetical cases therefore is stronger. The more efficient\nthe fact finding processes of the World Court become, the better are\nits opportunities to render useful decisions and give sound legal guid-\nance to the Organization.\nThe work of the Court as a creator of symbols and the relationship\nto this work of fact finding are less obvious matters. There is now\na plateau in the growth of the United Nations from which we are un-\nlikely to move without a dramatic shift in human attitudes concerning\nworld government. The problem of the Organization is somewhat\nanalogous to that of a human being who must create in his own en-\nvironment his rational fiction of what he believes himself to be.

If he does not create his fiction for some reason, he has nothing\nto live up to. Not only is there now lacking any consistent demand\nfrom the people of the world that the United Nations be the focal point\nwhere national and other differences can be settled peacefully, but the\npermanent personnel of the Organization and the State officials con-\ncerned with its affairs seem to lack a sense of obligation to act boldly\nto stimulate such a demand. This is not to impugn the good intention\nor deny the manifest ability of any statesman involved. The observa-\ntion is intended only to illustrate the point that no dynamic symbol of\ninternational government has been created in the minds of men or,\napparently, is in the making. A living organization is an image in\nthe minds of men, an image of what men think the organization should\nbe rather than a collection of constitutions, by-laws, organizational\nroutines, functonaries and filing cabinets.\nIgnoring for immediate purposes the complex variables that are\ninvolved in establishing a pattern of human conduct, three basic steps\nare necessary to create a leadership symbol in the mind of a man. He\nmust be provoked to respond to a principle since a response to principle\nis more intense and enduring than a response to other stimuli. He\nmust also be permitted to respond to inconsistent principles.5 A man\nis prepared to give his primary loyalty to a leadership symbol if he\ncan reserve loyalty to secondary symbols. If loyalty to secondary sym-\nbols is not permitted, loyalty to a primary leadership symbol is never\ndeveloped or, if developed, is greatly weakened. A man stoutly resists\nslavery of his mind. It is in his mind that the defenses of self-respect\nare erected. It has been aptly remarked that a loss of self-respect is\nthe first step to treason. But a third step is also necessary to create a\nnew leadership symbol. The mind must be helped to reconcile its re-\nsponse to inconsistent principles. Some rational and acceptable ex-\nplanation must be forthcoming to justify response to a primary leader-\nship symbol while a response to other symbols is continued. New\nleadership symbols are constructed in the human mind and old symbols\nare diffused or subordinated in importance in this process of reconcil-\ning conflicting principles.\nIt is in the third basic step in developing leadership symbols that\nthe judicial system of an emerging political society usually figures so\nprominently. In England, for example, the Common Law courts ham-\nmered out the concept of a fictional and responsible Crown to which\nparamount loyalty was due. The conflicting loyalties and confused\n5.

Again, the Commerce Clause has been applied by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States to events produced by a growing industrial\nsociety in such a way that the federal government has assumed the\ndirection of economic affairs while the role of state authority has been\ncorrespondingly reduced. The task of the World Court is to create\nan image of the United Nations in the minds of men as a primary\nleadership symbol without eroding to any appreciable degree the re-\nsponse of men to State and other parochial symbols.\nThe part played by courts in developing leadership symbols in\nthe early stages of formation of a political society differs radically from\ntheir role when a political society has matured. When leadership\nsymbols have been developed and are firmly implanted, an insistence\nupon loyalty to primary leadership symbols appears to produce minor\nbut frequent shifts in attitudes concerning subordinate symbols. In\nthis situation, the minds of men are more easily manipulated through\nrepresentative bodies with flexible procedures and in close contact with\nthe daily life of a community than the courts. In the United States\nthe disorderly growth of fraternal benefit societies and business cor-\nporations after the Civil War required action by the Congress or by\nthe state legislatures. The courts could not deal with public utility\nholding companies in the Twentieth Century until the Congress enacted\nlegislation for that purpose. The function of a court in a matured\npolitical society tends to become of an interstitial and housekeeping\nnature.' The court of an emerging political society must be a laborer\nof all work.\nSince peace was sought unsuccessfully in the League experiment,\nit would not have been shocking to those who follow the work of\ninternational organizations closely if the San Francisco Conference\nhad produced an international court system designed to spark a sound\nand orderly growth of world government. It is the drive for resolu-\ntion of conflict that provides the incentive for the formation of new\npolitical societies. As a principal resolver of conflict, the adjudicator\nhas always been an obvious choice, for it is in its courts that an emerg-\ning government has its closest contact with the governed. But a court\nin an inchoate political system must be more than the simple adjudi-\n6. The term \"interstitial\" is used here in the sense that the Court functions as an\nauxiliary to institutions which are charged with the continuous making, undoing and\nremaking of policies that the management of a complex community requires. The\nCourt, of course, creates conditions under which policies are made by other institu-\ntions, but it does this spasmodically without clear cut policing of the effects of its\ndecisions and consequent necessary adjustments.\n[VOL. 4: p. 37\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

We are not now concerned\nwith the role of the World Court in a matured political society. That\nproblem can be faced many generations hence by people better prepared\nto deal with it.\nThe Court established at San Francisco in 1945 is primarily an\nadjudicating institution in the \"national\" sense.8 The statute of the\nCourt is almost the same as that of the Permanent Court of Interna-\ntional Justice with which it maintains, practically speaking, an un-\nbroken tradition and skein of experience. To the ordinary man, 9 the\nman whose influence will determine ultimately whether there will be\neffective international organization or not, the World Court is as re-\nmote as the Supreme Court of Saturn. The statute of the Court can\nbe formally amended only in the manner provided for amendment of\nthe Charter of the United Nations.' \u00b0 Neither the statute nor the charter\nare likely to be amended at any time in the foreseeable future. What\ncan be done to utilize the Court in such a way that its work will en-\nhance the appeal of the United Nations to the \"mass mind\" as a leader-\nship symbol and thus increase the prestige and effective action of the\nOrganization at a time when effective action is sorely needed? How\ncan this be done without amending formally the statute of the Court?\nThe writer does not pretend to have pat answers to either of these\nquestions, and doubts that anyone does.

In certain rare instances individuals have had an opportunity to get their\ncases before the Court. In Danzig Legislative Decrees, P.C.I.J., Ser. A/B, No. 65\n(advisory opinion 1935), the Court considered a dispute concerning a statute enacted\nby the Danzig Senate applying the criminal law doctrine of analogy. The Court deter-\nmined that the Free City of Danzig should have State status for this proceeding.\nThis meant, in effect, that the Court would hear only one side of the case since the\nSenate represented the Free City and the Senate was Nazi-controlled. The President\nof the Court therefore received an explanatory note from the opposing political parties\nin Danzig, although these parties were not allowed to be representd in the oral\nproceedings.\n[VOL. 4: p. 37\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This includes the position of\ndelegate for a government to the International Labor Conference. 64\nThe principle applied by the Permanent Court to determine the in-\ncompatibility of the function of judge and service on an arbitral tri-\nbunal was, originally, whether the agreement upon which the arbi-\ntration was based provided for an appeal to the Court or settlement\nby the Court in case the arbitration failed. 5 At a later date this\nprinciple was abandoned upon the assumption that the judge could\nbe disqualified if the case ultimately came before the Court.66\nThe International Court of Justice has applied a principle more\nrestrictive than that established originally by the Permanent Court.\nA judge may not accept the functions of arbitrator, chairman of a\ncommission of conciliation or inquiry, or any similar function, if there\nis any provision to the effect that a decision taken by him, or one\nin which he has taken part, may be the subject of an application to\nthe Court or if there is a possibility that the decision may be the sub-\nject of an application.6\"\nThe judges of the World Court should be encouraged to par-\nticipate actively in international affairs collateral to their duties upon\nthe Court.

Treaties\nsometimes provide for appointment by the President of the Court of\narbitrators, umpires or members of conciliation commissions. Thus,\nthe Treaty of Lausanne provided for appointment of the President of\nthe Mixed Arbitral Tribunals by the President of the Court if the\nparties could not agree upon a selection. The President performed\nthis function in 1924 by appointing a President for the Greco-Turkish\nand Romano-Turkish Tribunals. 9 Special requests are sometimes made\nby States or international organizations for appointments to fill special\noffices. In 1954 the President nominated a Chairman for a Special\nAdvisory Board appointed by the Secretary-General of the United\nNations.7\" Requests are also made by corporations to appoint arbi-\ntrators to settle contract disputes and these requests are usually granted.\nCertain appointments, quite certainly, have no potential value to\nthe Court as information sources.7 \nBut in other instances, such as an\nappointment of members of a conciliation commission or arbitral board,\nthe appointment could be conditioned upon reports by the member\nconcerned or upon his willingness to testify or produce evidence be-\nfore the Court if later called upon. The President is usually approached\nand his consent secured before the treaty provision or special request\nfor appointment is made. The appointing practice does seem to be a\nbud from which increased efficiency in finding facts could quickly flower.\nIII.\nALLOCATION OF THE INTELLIGENCE TASK.\nJudge Hudson, in his careful and distinguished treatment of the\nwork of the Permanent Court of International Justice, states: \"Issues\nof fact are seldom tried before the Court, and where a question ot\nfact arises the Court must usually base its finding on statements made\non behalf of the parties either in the documents of the written pro-\nthe Court have general diplomatic immunity in the Netherlands.

The\nburden is on the opponent to produce the facts and, if he can be kept\nfrom getting them in, so much the better for the client. The practice\nhas been tolerated not only because of the lawyer's affection for tradi-\ntion but because the judge does not have the time to set out upon ex-\ntensive fact-finding inquiries of his own. The judge is an umpire at\ntrial. The judge on appeal tends to accept the facts produced at trial.\nThere is no reason why this situation should exist in cases brought\nbefore the World Court. The General List of the Court is not over-\ncrowded and the judges, or at least most of them, are not imbued with\nAnglo-American legal traditions. Why are the parties allowed to per-\nform the major fact-finding function before the World Court? Who\nmakes the decisions which determine who finds the facts?\nThe statute of the Court sets forth the major outlines of the\nfact-finding missions which the Court can pursue. Since the statute\nis based upon State consent and State consent pervades the entire\nproblem of the Court's jurisdiction, it is understandable that special\ndeference should be shown to the statements made by State repre-\nsentatives and the facts produced by them. Nevertheless, in spite of\nthe very real obstacle that State consent presents in fact-finding, this\nsingle factor cannot explain why the Court has not moved with greater\nfreedom in finding facts within the confines that its statute establishes.\nTwo factors appear to account for the reticence of the Court,\nparticularly in contentious cases, to make independent inquiries. The\nCourt has been prone to regard executive-administrative findings-of-\nfact as conclusive because of the limitations set by the statute upon\nits own fact-finding activities. This predisposition has carried over\ninto contentious litigation, the State being treated as an administrative\nfact-finder whose conclusions must be accepted at face value unless\nmanifestly questionable. Likewise, in the history of the Permanent\nCourt, there were efforts to use the Court as a fact-finding institution\nfor the League and other international organizations. This resulted in\nresistence within the Court to any extension of judicial fact-finding\nactivity.\n72.

The Notion of Executive-Administrative Finality.\nIn the Anglo-American and Civil Law judicial systems the theory\nof finality of administrative and legislative findings-of-fact has been\nfirmly implanted. The theory may be based upon constitutional sepa-\nration of powers, upon a need for efficiency in sifting voluminous facts\nor upon the inability of the Court to appraise remote events. It is\nunderstandable that judges trained in the Anglo-American and Civil\nLaw systems should tend to apply these theories to the work of the\nWorld Court. There is also more justification for the application of\ntheories of finality when the fact-finding ability of the Court is sub-\nstantially curtailed. The Court has no processes to compel the pro-\nduction of evidence. It may request of public international organiza-\ntions information relative to cases before it,73 and may call upon the\nagents to produce any document or supply any explanation. 7\n4 Relevant\nquestions may be put to witnesses and experts.7\n3 But the Court must\ndepend upon the consent of States to produce witnesses or permit the\nmaking of inquiries on the spot.76 Requests for advisory opinions\nmust be accompanied by all documents \"likely to throw light\" upon\nthe question. 77\nLacking the necessary power to compel the production of the\nevidence it may need, the Court tends to rely heavily upofi the evidence\nsubmitted without positive efforts to police the truth of the facts. In\nthe case of The Prince of Pless,7\n8 Poland maintained that the German\napplication was inadmissible so long as the Prince had failed to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies in Poland. The Court found it unnecessary\nto pass upon the issue of exhaustion of remedies: \"Since in any event\nit will certainly be an advantage to the Court, as regards the points\nwhich have to be established in the case, to be acquainted with the final\ndecision of the Supreme Polish Administrative Tribunal upon the\nappeals brought by the Prince von Pless and now pending before that\ntribunal and .. .the Court must therefore arrange its procedure so\nas to insure that this will be possible.

The details of the use by the Council of\nadvisory opinions as a device for presenting contentious litigation to\nthe Court are considered hereafter. But once the entering wedge was\nplaced, the Council also sought advisory opinions relating to the diffi-\ncuties of the Free City of Danzig. The Free City was a ward of the\nCouncil and was under the general supervision of a High Commis-\nsioner. In a series of cases, the first group involving Polish claims\nto certain functions within the City and access to port facilities and\nthe second rising out of Nazi party activity within the City, the Council\nthrew administrative problems into the lap of the Court that probably\ncould and should have been solved by the Council and High Commis-\nsioner without judicial action. 5 There was also a tendency to try to\nthrust upon the Court some of the fact-finding problems of the Mixed\nCommission for the exchange of Greek and Turkish populations under\nthe Convention of Lausanne. The Court dutifully complied with the\nrequests for aid in the Danzig cases, although in Danzig Legislative\nDecrees, Judge Anzilotti remarked:\n\"All that can be said is that the reason why the Council asked\nfor the Court's opinion was because it desired to be informed as\nto the scope and effects of certain provisions of the Danzig Con-\nstitution and of certain acts of the Senate, in order to enable it\nto exercise the guarantees of the League of Nations. Now al-\nthough it is the right and obligation of the Council to obtain any\ninformation which it considers useful or necessary, it is equally\ntrue that it must do this by appropriate methods, and must not\nseek to impose on the Court duties different from those for which\nit was created and organized.\"8 6\nWith respect to inquiries by the Mixed Commission, however, the\nCourt assumed a different attitude. In Exchange of Greek and Turkish\nPopulations7 the Mixed Commission induced the Council of the League\nto seek the opinion of the Court on the questions:\n\"What meaning and scope should be attributed to the word\n'established' in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lausanne . . . in regard\nto which discussions have arisen and arguments have been put\nforward which are contained in the documents communicated\nby the Mixed Commission?

At the present\ntime, the Court seems to take it for granted that if the parties are in\nagreement on the facts, the facts agreed upon will be taken as the\nbasis of the decision. In this situation the State parties determine\nthe allocation of intelligence tasks.\nThe likelihood of a dispute as to facts is fairly remote. This is\nnot because the parties are anxious to quickly reach a peaceful solu-\ntion but simply because neither party has enough facts to question\nthe facts submitted by the other. Records may be lost, the events in\nquestion may have occurred within the territory of one of the parties,\nor the case might be pitched on events long passed. When the facts\ndo get into dispute in the usual proceeding on the merits it is because\none of the parties by espionage or other informal practices has suc-\nceeded in penetrating the barriers to the flow of information established\nby the other.\nIn the Oscar Chinn Case\n93 the British were unable to dispute the\nBelgian allegations of fact concerning the de facto monopoly alleged\nby the British because the evidence the British needed was in the\nBelgian Congo. The British had no access to the facts and the Court\nwas not prepared to get the facts for them. In the Nottebohm Case\n94\nGuatemala could not make an issue of fact concerning the alleged fraud\nof Nottebohm in obtaining Liechtenstein nationality because it could\nnot have access to the necessary records in Liechtenstein. In the\nCorfu Channel Case the British took the necessary evidence to raise\nan issue of fact with Albania by sweeping mines in the Corfu Channel\nover Albania's protest.

In the Case of Interpretation\nof Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (The Chorzow Factory),\"9 the Court\nagreed to interpret a passage in Judgment No. 7: \"If Poland wishes\nto dispute the validity of this entry, it can, in any case, only be an-\nnulled in pursuance of a decision given by the competent tribunal.\"\nPoland had contended that the land-book entry was invalid, and, after\nthe judgment, commenced a proceeding before the Tribunal of Kato-\nwice to annul it.

Allocation of the Intelligence Task in Advisory Cases.\nIn contrast to the restricted rule of the Court in allocating fact-\nfinding missions in contentious cases, in advisory cases the ultimate\ndecision as to who finds what facts and where the facts are to be found\nrests with the Court. There are several reasons for this. The most\nimportant reason is that the statute of the Court places no substantial\nlimits upon its activity in advisory cases.'24 Also, while advisory de-\ncisions may be binding in a moral sense and are usually accepted by\nthe organizations or States concerned, the advisory decision is bind-\ning in a legal sense only when the parties have agreed by treaty or\nconvention that the advisory opinion is to bind.'25 States have little\nto lose and much to gain by participating in advisory proceedings. The\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly may request advisory\nopinions. \nLikewise other organs of the United Nations and the\nspecialized agencies may make the requests when authorized by the\nGeneral Assembly. 26 A State cannot request an advisory opinion di-\nrectly but may be able to persuade the General Assembly or some other\norganization authorized to seek advisory opinions to make the request\n121.

It should\nalso be observed that the major contributions of the International\nCourt of Justice to the doctrine of international law have been made\nin advisory cases. 131\nThe advisory proceeding is the ideal vehicle for fact-finding activity\nby the Court. The Court cannot volunteer opinions. An international\norganization qualified to do so must request them. 1 2 But is it possible\nthat factually static contentious litigation may be short circuited into\nductile advisory proceedings in which the Court might be prepared\nto make independent findings?

This\nis one of the sensitive issues before the Court today.\nThe present position of the Court appears to be as follows: The\nCourt is entitled to withhold an advisory opinion and will do so if its\nopinion requires a decision directly upon the merits of a State dispute\nand one or more of the States concerned do not participate in the\nproceeding. This may also be the case when the States participate in\nthe proceeding, but a request for an opinion should not in principle\nbe refused.' 83 When the opinion relates to legal grounds actually pend-\ning between States, the opinion has no binding force. However, no\nState, whether a member of the United Nations or not, can prevent\nthe giving of an advisory opinion which the United Nations deems\ndesirable for its guidance.\" 4 The Court is not concerned with the\npolitical motive of the General Assembly in submitting a request for\nan opinion.\"' The Court is the principal judicial organ of the United\nNations and will function accordingly. The rules provide that if the\nrequest for an advisory opinion relates to legal questions actually\npending between States the provisions of the statute relating to ad hoc\njudges shall apply.\" 6 In applying the provisions of the statute re-\nlating to contentious proceedings to advisory proceedings the Court\nhas stated that it will \"above all consider whether the advisory opinion\nrelates to a legal question actually pending between two or more\nStates.\"' 8\nSince 1946, the General Assembly, which has requested all except\none of the advisory opinions, has presented its questions in abstract\nform. In at least one instance the question was so abstract that the\nCourt could not answer it directly. This tactic of the General Assembly\nhas not prevented States from appearing and attacking the jurisdic-\ntion of the Court. 1 3\n8\nThe judges likewise must consider the experience of the Perma-\nnent Court in \"advisory arbitration.\" '\n'  \nThe League Covenant pro-\nvided that the Court could give an advisory opinion upon any dispute\n133.

The case is a judicial landmark and figures\nprominently in the subsequent discussion. 146\n145. SANDIER, EVIDENCE BEFORE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS \n(1939); WITN-\nBERG, La Theorie des Preuves devant les Jurisdictions Internationales, 56 HAGUE\nREcuEIL 5 (1936).\n146. In view of numerous references to this case in the subsequent materials the\nfacts of the case are stated briefly here. On October 22, 1946, two British destroyers,\nH.M.S. \"Saumarez\" and H.M.S. \"Volage\" struck mines while passing through the\nfairway of the Corfu Channel. These vessels were part of a squadron passing through\nthe Channel subject to secret British orders X.C.U. Upon receipt of the report of the\nmining, the Central International Mine Clearance Board recommended that the\nchannel be reswept at a favorable opportunity (the channel having been swept prior\nto October 1946), but stated that the sweeping of the channel remained an issue out-\nside its scope. The British nevertheless swept the channel on the 12th and 13th of\nNovember, 1946 (Operation Retail). A member of the Mediterranean Mine Clearance\nBoard, Commander Mestre, attended the sweeping as an observer. Two German G-Y\nmines were recovered and taken to Malta for inspection. Diplomatic negotiations with\nAlbania having failed, the British took the case before the Security Council under\nArticle 35 of the Charter. Albania accepted an invitation to attend the Security\nCouncil proceedings upon condition of her acceptance, for the purposes of the dispute,\nof the obligations of a member of the United Nations. The Security Council appointed\na subcommittee to investigate the facts, and the report of this committee was con-\nsidered by the Council. Ultimately, a finding by the Council adverse to Albania was\nblocked by the veto, but a British resolution referred the case to the World Court.\nThe British brought the case before the Court by application, and Albania raised a\npreliminary question of jurisdiction on the ground that the case should have been\nsubmitted by special agreement. The Court decided that it was unnecessary to pass\nupon this issue because Albania had voluntarily accepted its jurisdiction by a letter of\nJuly 2, 1947. Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection), Judgment of March 25,\n1948, [1947-48] I.C.J. Rep. 15.\nImmediately after this decision the case was submitted by special agreement. The\nclaim of the United Kingdom in this agreement was Albanian responsibility for the\nexplosions and liability for the resulting damages. The British case was that the\nmines were laid by Yugoslavia with Albanian connivance or that Albania knew the\nmines had been laid and failed to give notice as required by international law. Albania\ncounterclaimed that the United Kingdom had violated her sovereignty on October 22,\n1946, not having been in innocent passage, and had again violated her sovereignty in\nOperation Retail on the 12th and 13th of November 1946. After hearing witnesses\nand directing an expert inquiry on the spot, the Court gave judgment for the British\non their claim on the ground that Albania knew or should have known of the mining\nand failed to give warning; the court gave judgment for Albania on that part of her\ncounterclaim pertaining to Operation Retail. The Court determined the indemnity in\na separate proceeding in which Albania refused to participate. A second committee of\nexperts was formed to aid the Court in determining the indemnity due.

After two British requests, the Albanian agent also submitted\na statement of the substance of the testimony his witnesses would\noffer.16\nThe general plan of procedure was arranged at a meeting between\nthe President of the Court and the agents on November 8, 1948, a\nday prior to commencement of the oral proceedings. In general, the\nplan was that two British counsel would make opening statements\nfollowed by an answer by counsel for Albania. Then the witnesses\nwere to be examined. The British were then to make their reply\napproximately twenty-four hours after the last of the witnesses was\nheard and the Albanian counsel would then make their rejoinder.'65\nAs soon as the first part of the oral arguments had been completed\nthe President ordered the agents to inform the Registrar of the par-\nticulars of the witnesses whom they proposed to call.\nThe hearing of witnesses commenced on November 22, 1948, and\nlasted until December 14, 1948.

In the Corfu\nChannel Case a reasonable ground for refusal to testify was respected\nby the Court. Thus, Commander Kovacic refused to disclose the\nname of the Yugoslav who told him that Sub-Lieutenant Drago\nBlazevic had said that the Yugoslav minelayers placed mines in the\nCorfu Channel.

The efficiency of examination of witnesses and the care\nin recording testimony is in marked contrast to the first efforts in\nGerman Interests in Upper Silesia.

The flexibility of the Court's\nprocedures are well illustrated by the examination of Commander\nKovacic.

Evidence is seldom excluded by the Court.\n(1.) \nUnreasonable \nSearches and Seizures.\nThe Court appears to accept evidence no matter how it was\nobtained by the party which produces it. In the Corfu Channel Case\nevidence was admitted which had been obtained by espionage.224 Part\nof the key evidence in the British case had been obtained by the in-\nternational equivalent of an \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" After\nthe mining incident of October 22, 1946, the British swept the Corfu\nchannel in \"Operation Retail\" (November 1946) over the protest of\nAlbania. Twenty-two mines were cut and two mines, which proved\nto be German mines of the G.Y. type, were recovered and taken to\nMalta. The mines appeared to have been laid a short time before\nthe incident of 22 October. The Court admitted evidence obtained\nfrom examination of the mines and related technical details. In answer\nto Albania's counterclaim that the United Kingdom had violated her\nsovereignty in \"Operation Retail,\" the British argued that they were\nsecuring evidence for the Court which might have been lost if the\nmines had been removed by Albania or had been equipped with auto-\nmatic flooding devices. The British also argued that self help justified\ntheir action. Both arguments were rejected by the Court and the United\nKingdom was held liable on the counterclaim. The evidence obtained,\nhowever, formed part of the basis for the decision of the Court that\nAlbania was liable to the United Kingdom on the British claim.\nAn exclusion of evidence by the Court based upon the way in\nwhich it was secured would be unrealistic in view of the known barriers\nestablished by States to the flow of information. The Court is not\nfaced with the problem of intermittent police abuses of individuals\nwhich national constitutional guarantees are designed to minimize.\nThe Court must get its evidence when and by whatever means it can\nobtain it.\n223.

The\nCourt will not consent if the opposing party will have no opportunity\nto comment upon it or offer rebutting evidence.22 \nAs a general propo-\nsition, no further documents may be submitted by a party after the\nclose of written proceedings without consent by the other party. If\nthe other party does not object it is presumed to consent.226 If the\nother party does object, the Court, after a hearing, determines whether\nthe evidence will be admitted or excluded. If the evidence is admitted,\nthe objecting party must have an opportunity to comment upon it\nand submit documents in support of its contentions.\n227\nIf an agent or counsel refers to a document in his oral statement,\nhe is ordinarily expected to produce it. 2 8 Production is also required\nif the document is to be used in the examination of witnesses.\n229\nComment upon unproduced documents has created difficulty. In\nthe Mavrommatis Case\n230 the Greek counsel was permitted to read an\nextract from Hansard's Parliamentary Debates over objection by the\nBritish counsel, the Court reserving its decision as to the importance\nto be attached to the material.23' In the Peter Pazmany University\nCase\n2\n12 the Czech agent, before the opening of the hearings, announced\nhe intended to produce additional documents, of which he furnished\na list.

In some\ninstances it is difficult to determine which State is plaintiff and which\ndefendant. The Court also may make independent findings of fact.\nIn the Corfu Channel Case the United Kingdom admitted it bore the\nburden of proof of Albanian complicity but argued that the burden\nwould be discharged by satisfying the Court of Albanian complicity\nwith reasonable certainty. The British further argued that the burden\nof going forward with the evidence was shifted to Albania because\nAlbania had exclusive control of its territorial waters and adjacent\nland and knowledge of the events preceding the mining was likely to\nbe confined to her government. 2\n38  Albania appeared to admit the\nburden of proof on her counter-claim but argued that the British bore\nthe burden of proof on their defenses of innocent passage, securing\nevidence for the Court and self help.2 3\n9 The British answered that,\nassuming the Albanian contention was true, once the British established\nthe principle of their exception, the burden would shift to Albania to\nshow that the British had exceeded their rights. The Court rejected\nthe British argument that exclusive control and special knowledge\nby Albania shifted the burden of going forward with the evidence on\nthe issue of complicity.\n24\u00b0 The Court ruled in favor of Albania on\nthat part of its counterclaim pertaining to \"Operation Retail\" and\nthus did not pass upon the issue whether, if the British could have\nproved their exception, the burden of going forward with the evidence\non the issue of unreasonable exercise of the British rights would have\nshifted.\nIn the Minquiers and Erechos Case\n241 the special agreement be-\ntween France and the United Kingdom stated their intent as to the\npresentation of pleadings without prejudice to any question as to the\nburden of proof.

Judicial \nNotice.\nThe judges of the Court often bring to a case facts that have not,\nstrictly speaking, been introduced in evidence. In the nature of the\nwork of the judges of the Court and in view of the kind of case with\nwhich the Court deals, the judge cannot be a stranger to a case in\nthe sense that a judge of a national court may hear a case for the\nfirst time when it is argued before him. By its statute the Court is\nnot restricted to the evidence produced by the parties. Informal con-\ntributions by the judges are inevitable and desirable. Thus, while\nthe Court has had occasion to take judicial notice of certain facts,\njudicial notice has been used more often to describe the things that\nthe Court will not consider without proof. For example, the Court\nhas stated that it will not take notice of a municipal law but will obtain\nknowledge of it with the aid of the parties or by inquiries by the\nCourt.\n244 On the other hand, the Court will take notice of treaties\nand administrative acts relating to them.245 The Court will also take\nnotice of historical events2\n40 and publicized contemporary political\nsituations.\n247\n(5.) \nCircumstantial Evidence -\nAdverse Presumptions.\nThe Court has dealt with circumstantial evidence in a number\nof cases. 48 In the Corfu Channel Case the Court based its decision on\nthe British claim upon circumstantial evidence and thus found it neces-\nsary to discuss the matter in detail.

The Court stated, however, that Al-\nbania's position precluded the British from furnishing direct proof of\nfacts giving rise to responsibility so that the British should be allowed\na more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.\n\"This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use\nis recognized by international decisions. It must be regarded as of\nspecial weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together\nand leading logically to a single conclusion.\"24 \nThe Court considered\nproof of Albanian knowledge of the mining could be drawn from in-\nferences of fact provided they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\nFrom the attitude of Albania before and after the mining incident\nin conjunction with the information furnished by its experts, the Court\nconcluded that Albania must have had knowledge of the mining.\n25\u00b0\nThe World Court appears unwilling to draw inferences from the\nnon-production of documents, although the statute indicates that the\nCourt may take formal notice of a refusal to produce.2 ' In the Corfu\nChannel Case the Court was urged to infer from the refusal of the\nBritish to produce Order X.C.U., which related to the passage of the\nCorfu Strait on 22 October 1946, that the order contained instruc-\ntions to reconnoiter the Albanian Coast. \nThe Court refused to\ndraw conclusions differing from those to which the actual events gave\nrise.52 The use of adverse presumptions might provide an effective\nsanction for the production of documents. 5 3\nD. Security Considerations.\nA disclosure of facts is a major object of judicial proceedings.\nA State which commences a case before the Court must assume that\nassertion of its claim will entail a disclosure of information which it\nmight prefer to restrict. The assertion of State policy in judicial pro-\nceedings is accompanied by a security loss. Likewise, a State which\naccepts the jurisdiction of the Court must anticipate a security loss in\nmaking its defense or asserting a counterclaim. In the Corfu Channel\n249.

The report\nwas submitted to the Court as a photograph of an edited document.\nIn order to prove that the document had been edited, the British found\nit necessary to introduce a photograph of the un-edited document which\nat the time was still classified as secret.\n254. In the Albanian counterclaim\nit was contended that the British vessels were not in innocent passage\nat the time of the mine incident on October 22, 1946. In support of\nthis claim they relied upon a report of the Captain of the \"Volage,\"\none of the damaged vessels, in which it was stated that the Albanian\ndefenses had been studied at close range and that the information was\nincluded with reference to X.C.U. The Court requested the British\nagent to produce this document but he refused to do so on the ground\nof naval secrecy even though the Albanian agent offered to produce\nall relevant Albanian orders and instructions \"even the most secret\"\nin exchange for the production of Order X.C.U.\n255\nThe pressure to disclose information may be exerted against a\nState not technically a party to the proceeding. In the Corfu Channel\nCase the British introduced the testimony of Commander Kovacic, a\nformer Yugoslav navy officer, who had been in charge of signal re-\npairs at the Yugoslav naval shipyard at Sibenik before the mining\nincident of 22 October 1946. Commander Kovacic's testimony indi-\ncated that the Yugoslav minelayers, Mljet and Meljine, had been\nloaded with G.Y. mines at the base shortly before 22 October 1946\nand had put to sea, returning a short time later unladen. He offered\nhearsay evidence that the mines had been laid in the Corfu Channel. 256\nThe testimony supported the British contention that the mines had been\nlaid with Albanian connivance. In an effort to counteract this testi-\nmony the Albanians secured from the Yugoslavs certain documents,\namong which was the register of the shipyard at Sibenik. Originally\na photostat of one page had been submitted, but the British objected\n254. 2 CORFU CHANNEL CASE -\nPLEADINGS, ORAL ARGUMENTS, AND DOCUMENTS\n255; 3 id. at 204.\n255.

In\n1926, President Huber proposed a new rule of Court placing the\nresponsibility on the party which introduced the secret information\nand allowing the opposing party to demand a private hearing.26 9 The\nproposal met with much opposition from the Court on the ground that\nit was superfluous and perhaps dangerous since the parties acting\ntogether might produce any information they saw fit. The consensus\nof the Court appeared to be that the State producing the information\nwas responsible in principle and that the Court could exclude evidence\nwhich it could not properly take into account and make public.\n2 7\n0\nResistance to the jurisdiction of the Court or obstruction of its\nfact gathering processes on security grounds is a more serious matter.\nThe principal difficulty encountered by the Permanent Court was in\nobtaining preparatory materials used for the Versailles Conference.271\nIn his dissenting opinion in the Oscar Chinn Case, Judge Van Eysinga\nnoted:\n\"The undersigned cannot refrain in this connection from\nexpressing his regret that the Court should frequently be called\nupon to give decisions in regard to collective conventions con-\ncluded after the Great War without having at its disposal the rec-\nords of the meetings at which these conventions were elaborated,\nthese records being kept secret. The resulting lack of information\nhas more than once made itself felt in the present case.\n272\nThe security restrictions proved an embarrassment even in those\ncases in which one of the parties offered to produce the necessary\nmaterials. In The Jurisdiction of the European Commission of the\nDanube\n271 the agent of one of the States cited certain records of the\npreparation of the Versailles treaty.

The\nCourt reversed its decision on the matter of admitting the records in\nevidence pending an answer to its inquiry but delivered its opinion\nbefore the answer was received. Subsequently the President of the\nConference of Ambassadors expressed his appreciation of the Court's\nrefusal to take the secret documents into consideration without the\nunanimous consent of all States concerned.\nWhile the Permanent Court did not renounce its authority to re-\nquest the production of documents, secret or not, in some cases secret\ndocuments were excluded upon grounds that avoided the secrecy\nissue.\n274 In the case of International \nCommission of the Oder\n275 the\nPolish agent referred to preparatory work done by the Commission\non Ports, Waterways and Railways of the Versailles Conference. The\nevidence was excluded on the ground that the Polish agent did not\nintend to make use of these records in his defense and the records\ncould not be used in any event since three of the parties in the case,\nGermany, Denmark and Sweden, had not participated in the prepara-\ntory work and the materials could not be used to determine for them\nthe meaning of the treaty.\nSince the Corfu Channel Case, few advisory opinions or conten-\ntious proceedings presented to the Court have involved serious security\nissues.\" 6 In those cases in which security issues might have been\ninvolved, the defendant State has not accepted the jurisdiction of the\nCourt.277 \nSecurity considerations will probably be the catalysts de-\ntermining which cases are received by the Court and which are not.\nThe British decision to refuse the jurisdiction of the Court in matters\ninvolving the national security of the United Kingdom, while perhaps\nprecipitated by the threat of judicial action concerning the tests of\nhydrogen bombs, is prophetic of the future.\n2\n274.

In the Peter Pazmany University\nCase\n279 the Court did not have most of the documents of the written\nproceedings of the arbitral tribunal which made the decision being re-\nviewed. In the Lotus Case\n28\n0 the Court did not have the Turkish ju-\ndicial decision that gave rise to the dispute. In the case of Minority\nSchools in Albania\n28 the decision was rendered based upon many\nassumptions concerning the Albanian education situation. But if the\nCourt can be developed into a more vital force as part of the United\nNations structure, which is a major assumption, attention to its fact-\nfinding resources should receive a high priority. In particular, it may\nbe hoped that the advisory jurisdiction of the Court can be expanded,\nsince the advisory proceeding is the ideal fact-finding vehicle under\nthe present statute of the Court.\n279.

The political \nrules adopted for an international cyber policy and \ncybersecurity policy will always lag behind techno-\nlogical developments. It is the more important, there-\nfore, that new regulations be subordinated to an over-\narching norm. Three crucial political requirements \narise from this: \n\uf034 European cooperation: integrating national policies \ninto the European framework; \n\uf034 Inclusiveness: giving different interest groups broad \nand publicly accessible representation in formulat-\ning policies; \n\uf034 Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-\nponent over the military component, particularly \nin times of peace. \n \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states \nbehave responsibly not only towards one another, but \nalso in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. \nThe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided \nfor this. As part of implementing the EU directive on \nnetwork and information security (NIS), all EU states \nmust introduce minimum standards and reporting \nrequirements for IT security, and operators of critical \ninfrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national \nregulations in civil law (data protection), commercial \nlaw (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-\nmestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-\nfil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, \nit will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned \nGlobal Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members \nlargely agree that states are responsible for their own \nbehaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation \namong Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as \nwell as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN \nGGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE \nnegotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-\ncrime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The \nminimum conditions for global cybersecurity are \nratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as \nwell as continuous confidence- and security-building \nmeasures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, \nwhich was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the \nInformation Society) follow-up process, showed that a \nworldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term. Therefore, \nthe decision taken in December 2015 to continue the \nInternet Governance Forum \u2013 in other words, to keep \npursuing the multi-stakeholder approach \u2013 still offers \nthe best chance of preventing the idea of a global free \nand open Internet from falling victim to governments\u2019 \nintensifying security considerations. In Internet Gov-\nernance, it is therefore crucial to support the multi-\nstakeholder approach (interpreted inclusively) and to \nreject the principle of intergovernmental decision-\nmaking. The experience of the WSIS process of the past \nten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of inter-\ngovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-\ning on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \noperators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-\nerly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-\ngy to protect the economy and industry against espio-\nnage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-\nbilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense \nindicates that it wants to build additional defensive \ncapabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not \nbe advisable for the government to evolve towards \nan offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in \nopen contradiction with the idea of due diligence \nin cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the \nrisk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber \nattacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-\ncult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause \nserious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on \nthe German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is \nto persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring \na given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse \nto NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against \nIslamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last \nresorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to \nprop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-\nrity technology, for developing digital forensics, and \nfor extensive further-training measures to heighten \nawareness among civil servants, scientists, academics \nand researchers. Confidence-building measures within \nthe OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under \nthe leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-\nsified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving \nbilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-\ning and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and \nremove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of \nthis is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ning cybercrime. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Such due diligence obligations may \nexist between states, between non-state actors (e.g., \nprivate corporations), and between state and non-\nstate actors.

According \nto the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-\ntories, and especially the computersystems and infra-\nstructure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 \ncontrol, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-\nture of other states.13 \nDue diligence is usually translated in international \nlaw treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-\npflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions \non one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful \nto use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence.

Decisions taken by individual states \nincreasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-\nritory. That is why states must exercise care with such \ndecisions and be accountable to one another for them. \nAs far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply \nlimit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. \nThis study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-\nnet needs to the political will by all stakeholders for \ninternational cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in \ncooperation with other states are obliged to do every-\nthing that may be reasonably expected of them to \nhelp deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \nThis expectation encompasses decision-making \nprocesses that meet high standards. This means that \navailable competences should be integrated as far as \npossible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics \nshould be avoided.16 In other words, an international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due \ndiligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode \nof regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy \nand cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated \nat the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated \ninto inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17 \n\uf034 Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \nwith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\nness as well as transparency.

Especially in \ntimes of crisis, the so-called rallying effect is an \nindispensable element of democratic resilience.\u201d19 \nHowever, the inclusiveness of legislative processes \nshould stop wherever private-sector actors start \nexerting a dominant influence on legislative bod-\nies.20 This can only be countered with transparent \nand representative processes that also give other \nstates a minimum of certainty that their legitimate \ninterests are being taken into consideration. The \nopenness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-\nmental prerequisite for states trusting one another \nso that they can deliver their individual contribu-\ntions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure \ncyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy \nto meet. In a technically challenging area such as \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, \nconsultations often need to be confidential. Fur-\nthermore, the expertise of large companies almost \ninevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-\ndinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or \nmembers of parliament to be accepted as compe-\ntent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore \nrequired to prevent one-sided representations of \ninterests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \nindustry.21 \nA maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign \npolicy states that regulatory practices should be co-\nordinated as closely as possible with its most impor-\ntant European partners.22 The internal market is so \ntightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 \nas indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that \nindividual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are \n \n19  Christopher Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolg-\nreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d, lecture given at \nthe CyberLab of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of \nexceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting \nof the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-\nnated in entire passages of text from trade-association position \npapers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative \nact.

German \nmeasures to promote a free and secure Internet \nshould therefore always be integrated at the Euro-\npean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously \nclaim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-\ntiating power on the global stage if it coordinates \nintensively with the leading European cybernations \n(France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, \nSpain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such \nas the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber \nIssues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-\nordinated at the European level can prevent global-\nisation and digitalisation from aggravating the \nsymptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany \nthat the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-\nspace24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-\nfies that states should not merely orientate themselves \nalong national interests, but also think in the catego-\nries of global public good. Germany\u2019s tradition of \ncivilian power25 is perpetuated in its international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy as well. \n\uf034 The German Federal Republic has always held to \nthe principle of generally pursuing its interests \nthrough economic and political rather than mili-\ntary means. In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy is one that tries to civilise inter-\nnational policy in cyberspace. That would mean \ninternationalising socially accepted norms as much \nas possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n \n23  The FoP Cyber was created in 2013 for a three-year period as \na permanent body to monitor the implementation of Europe\u2019s \ncyberstrategy.

Military violence \u2013 including an active cyber-\ndefence26 based on deterrence \u2013 could only be jus-\ntified at the national level in cases of self-defence \nand where it was coordinated with the EU and Nato \nmember states on the one hand and was decided by \nthe German Parliament. Responding to cyber attacks \nwith automatic counterattacks and digital acts of \nreprisal would be extremely problematic. For one \nthing, any attempt to attribute cyber attacks un-\nequivocally raises all sorts of technical, legal and \npolitical questions; for another, counterattacks can \nhave serious side-effects. Active cyberdefence might \nprovoke a digital arms race \u2013 for instance through \nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs27) \u2013 with incalcu-\nlable risks for fragile critical infrastructure. From a \ndue diligence perspective, a strategy of \u201cdeterrence-\nby-resilience\u201d28 is therefore preferable. With their \nnew IT-security law and the NIS (Network and Infor-\nmation Security) directive, Germany and the EU \nare leading by example in creating resilient infor-\nmation and communications structures in critical \ninfrastructure and in setting minimum standards \nin IT security. Research into resilience, prevention, \npeace and conflict has a key role to play in cyber-\nsecurity when it comes to civilising politics. \nIn due diligence, material and procedural contents \nmerge into an overarching norm.

The responsible authorities are now closely \ninterconnected. However, it is also clear that much \nstill needs to be improved with a view to European \ncooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response. \nInstitutional Structures \nThe German Federal Government has committed to \ncreating a complete instrumentarium in coordination \nwith the responsible state authorities to defend against \ncyber attacks.31 This is intended to contribute to guar-\nanteeing security provisions for the state as a whole. \nThe development of fully differentiated responsibili-\nties is politically willed.32 Germany\u2019s international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy contains a whole \nseries of cooperations, which essentially rest on five \npillars. \nFirst Pillar: The Federal Office for Information Security \nIn Germany, overall ministerial control over cyber-\nsecurity issues rests with the German Federal Ministry \nof the Interior (BMI).33 The Federal Office for Informa-\ntion Security (BSI) is the Federal Government\u2019s most \nimportant service provider in IT security.

For years, it has been involved in an in-\ntensive international exchange of experience and in-\nformation at the management and professional levels. \nAt the operations level, cooperation with other IT \nemergency teams is especially important.

The Centre is also part of the \nstate\u2019s project-based collaboration with companies \nand service providers, and with foreign security ser-\nvices. The separation rule is a fundamental tenet of \nGerman federal legislation and stipulates that the \ntasks of the police and the intelligence services must \nbe carried out by different, organisationally distinct \nauthorities. Counter-intelligence is the purview of the \nBfV while the BKA is responsible for policing criminally \nmotivated IT attacks.

In September \n2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen \nconfirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for \ncyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-\ntry\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned \nfor specific military cyber operations. There are also \nplans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) \nan expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-\nment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose \na risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for \nduty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-\nnent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \n\u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence \nservice\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider \non security issues, and it advises and supports the \nGerman armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and \non foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main \nbodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity \nstrategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-\nligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-\nmittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-\ntee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-\nmittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics \nof the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace \nmakes no distinction between domestic and foreign \npolicy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy \nand the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means \nof attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-\nputer programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, \ndisrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications \nsystems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-\nmation from data sources that are not publicly available.

However, the im-\nplementation of the three major challenges to an \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 \nnamely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-\nian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to \nestablish an overview of the cyber threat situation are \nunsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more \nsuccessful, proposals have been put forward to trans-\nform the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-\nbrella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint \nAnti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently \nbring together all federal and state authorities. There \nare also calls for more cooperation between national \nand EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, \nsuch as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany \nnot only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d \nfrequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part \nof the European coordination.

In part, these reforms have \nonly become public knowledge through leaked docu-\nments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-\ntional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February \n2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-\nbohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views \nhis links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times \nthe resources available for the offensive approach than \nthere are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks \nor compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a \nmember of the executive board of the Federal Associa-\ntion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-\ntions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only \none in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-\ncies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-\nnies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to \ncontact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather \nthan the police, since the latter would have to launch \na preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act \nwas suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-\ning the intelligence services as well as improving par-\nliamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55 \n \n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range \nlaunched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal \nnetzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason. However, the case was \ndropped after political intervention.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-\nj\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated \nfor regulating the exchange of information by intel-\nligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to \nbe created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-\nperson for the armed forces.56 \nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of \nthe Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised \nthat it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT \nsecurity, but that the BMI had overall control on issues \nof cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being \nquestioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. \nEven the National Cybersecurity Council has not been \nable to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient \ndistribution of resposibilities. In July 2013, while eluci-\ndating the NSA affair, the German Federal Govern-\nment did publish an eight-point programme on im-\nproving protection of the private sphere.57 However, \nthe Cybersecurity Council did not publicly take a \nposition on the questionable practices of the security \nservices \u2013 for instance, committing industrial espio-\nnage58 or keeping selector lists with spying targets.59 \n \n56  Rudi Wais, \u201cSo k\u00f6nnte eine bessere Kontrolle der Nachrich-\ntendienste aussehen\u201d, Augsburger Allgemeine, 3 May 2015, http:// \nwww.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/So-koennte-eine-bessere-\nKontrolle-der-Nachrichtendienste-aussehen-id33933952.html \n(accessed 30 November 2015). \n57  Federal Ministry of Defence/Federal Ministry of Industry \nand Technology, Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr einen besseren Schutz der Privat-\nsph\u00e4re, Fortschrittsbericht (Berlin, 14 August 2013), http:// \nwww.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Nachrichten/ \nPressemitteilungen/2013/08/bericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile. \n58  German Federal Parliament, Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die \nKleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Jan Korte, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Hahn, Ulla Jelpke, \nweiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

Many observers had expected a more \nproportionate reaction to the attack on Germany\u2019s \nhighest constitutional body. \nDigital Industrial Policy and the Importance \nof Private Actors \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional \nstructures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated \ncapabilities in information and communications tech-\nnology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 \nOver the past few decades, automisation has allowed \nthe German economy to respond well to the global \npressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal \nMinistry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost \nsmall and medium enterprises using its Digital Strat-\negy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily im-\nportant role in the Federal Government\u2019s international \ncybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in stra-\ntegic importance. The companies located there not \nonly create jobs and added value, but also set com-\npetitivity standards for whole economies.61 The Ger-\nman Federal Government believes that there is still \nplenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: \naccording to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for \nSystems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Net-\nworks could generate overall benefits to German \nsociety worth 56 million euros a year.62 \nHowever, other countries have digitalised more \nsuccessfully. The pioneering companies are mostly \nAmerican, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the \nGerman Federal Government launched the pro-\ngrammes Digital Agenda and Digital Management. \nHowever, these programmes are meagrely equipped \n \nJelpke, weiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal fund-\ning to the tune of around 200 million euros from the \nBMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to \nmake them competitive. It must be remembered that, \nto meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated \ninto European harmonisation and needs to focus on a \ndefensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThere has been criticism from the academia that \n\u201cthe Industrie 4.0 discourse [is] often too technical \nand national\u201d,63 and that it needed to be more closely \ninterconnected at the EU level than hitherto, because \nwhere (critical) infrastructure was concerned, solu-\ntions for data security, operational safety and data \nprotection were not being brought together.64 This is \nalso reflected in the Federal Government\u2019s programme \nDigital Agenda 2014\u20132017.

Their special focus is first \nand foremost the German industrial policy. However, \nIndustrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only \nbe designed at the European or even global level.68 \nIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a \nstrategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this \nmarket, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros \nto EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the \nCommission currently has only limited means avail-\nable for developing key digital technologies. The Con-\nnecting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for \nresearch for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the \nJuncker Commission took up its posts in November \n2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the \nhelp of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-\nmission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the \nmarket, as well as distributive policies should be got \noff the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the \nnecessary speed is a problem, however, because the \nCommission first has to harmonise the legal policies \nof all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions \npublished by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in \n2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a \nEuropean or transatlantic agreement on data-security \nand data protection policy.Important decisions in this \ncontext are those on the illegality of telecommunica-\ntions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and \non the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, \nIndustrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und \nforschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente \nVernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache \n18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nSch\u00f6ssler and Ben Scott, eds., Kompendium Industrie 4.0.

They consider the ECJ decisions and \nthe Commission\u2019s legal initiatives to be \u201cusing politics \nfor a digital industrial policy\u201d74 and to be protectionist. \nInclusiveness \nThe importance of private actors can also be seen in \nthe fact that they run much critical infrastructure, \nsuch as hospitals, banks, energy concerns and water-\nworks.

The direc-\ntive is intended to make IT more secure for operators \nof critical infrastructure and large online service pro-\nviders, and will oblige affected companies to report \nany security and data protection events or IT attacks. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-\nnet. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-\ntration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, \nbut not social networks. Small digital companies are \nalso excluded. According to the directive, member \nstates will have to build national reporting systems \nand exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-\ntent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific \nComputer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) \nin addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-\nvolved. The German Federal Government used the \nlong negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a \nsolution nationally with its industry, before the EU \nagreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed \nits IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced \nreporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and \nminimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-\nture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-\nties and private companies working in the area of \ncritical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It \nis especially questionable whether the private sector \ncan self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to \nbecome dependent on the interests of individual pri-\nvate actors to the point where they are barely able to \nact meaningfully without them.77 This dependency \nbecomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these \ncompanies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO \nhave so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy \nin these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-\nvidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great \nBritain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on \ndeterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-\nveillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-\nsions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-\npretations could potentially result from this, since \ntechnical, political and legal reasons make it almost \nimpossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, \ncyberinsecurity is growing within the international \ncommunity. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-\ntect their citizens and data; and at the same time they \nhave to regulate the digital sector, which is largely \ndominated by private companies. Creating universally \nsecure components is considered extremely difficult, \nbut where software is used by the state, transparency, \ntesting and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce \nfrom this state of affairs which are the most important \nareas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-\nrights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, \nfighting cybercrime; and developing international \nnorms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and \nin terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise \nfrom this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-\nsibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in \nthe policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-\nes in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence \nmeans taking to heart the three demands of European \ncooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85 \nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-\nral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and \nsecurity policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness.

Organi-\nsations such as Freedom House with its annual study \nFreedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or \nactivists for free software remind us again and again \nthat governments and globally active IT corporations \ndo not provide continual barrier-free Internet access \nacross the world. These organisations claim, for \ninstance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only \ngives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand \nthat Internet access should be a basic human right; \nat the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far \nfrom reaching a conclusion.87 \nIn a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights \nCouncil emphasised that human rights are valid in \nthe same way online as they are offline.88 In November \n2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN \nGeneral Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in \nthe digital age, in which, among other things, it pro-\nscribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic.89 \nIn May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom \nof expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption \nof private communications to be made a standard.

One com-\nmentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the \nlaw\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between \ncivil liberties and security measures during states of \nemergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-\nporteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to \nprivacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the \nlong term, integrated economic areas also need inte-\ngrated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty \ngives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-\ndom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-\nened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was \nlegally binding on the EU and came into force at the \nsame time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-\ngation on the EU to ratify the European Convention \nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental \nFreedoms. What holds true for the single market also \nholds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where \nthe transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU \nand USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy \nShield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic \nagreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, \nwhich might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-\nvant data and information. Intensive cooperation \namong law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed \nto fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-\nism, such as digital financial services providers, can \nonly be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely \non information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist \nFinance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-\nment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes \nand modernised mutual legal assistance agreements \n(MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive \ncooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n \n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche \nZeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and \nthe United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial \nMessaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the \nPurposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, \n27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-\ntive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nprehensive cooperation between the security services \n(as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, \nhowever, be subject to more stringent parliamentary \ncontrols. It is not in the interests of due diligence to \nhave secret services exchange their insights informally \nand, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for \ninstance those stipulated in agreements providing for \nmutual legal assistance.94 \nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human \nrights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to \nhave laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, \nat least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-\nmany and Europe, data protection is directly linked to \nthe right to informational self-determination whereby \ncitizens have a say in how their personal data may be \nused. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, \nbecause the state has a duty of protection towards its \ncitizens that it must fulfil.

Legally \nbinding data protection provisions between states \nhave so far only been concluded at a regional level, \nnamely in 1981 in the shape of the European Council\u2019s \nconvention on data protection. \nThe trialogue between representatives of the Com-\nmission, the European Parliament and the Council of \nthe European Union led to an agreement in December \n2015 on a package of reforms for data protection in \nthe shape of the General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR96), which replaced the EU\u2019s data protection \ndirective of 1995. The new Regulation will have to be \ntransposed directly into national law as of 2018. The \nGDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-\nlates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data \nprocessing by the police and judicial authorities of the \nEU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-\non of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other \nuses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-\nknown examples of this practice are the large digital-\nservice providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-\nbook, which store the data of European clients in the \nUS using data protection provisions that violate Euro-\npean law. Where there are grave violations of the data \n \n95  Alongside the relevant paragraphs in Germany\u2019s Basic Law, \nthe legal bases can be found in the primary legislation on the \nsecurity services, police and other authorities: Bundesdaten-\nschutzgesetz (BDSG), Telekommunikationsgesetz (TKG), Gesetz \nzur Beschr\u00e4nkung des Brief-, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses \n(Artikel 10-Gesetz \u2013 G10), Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundeskriminalamt \n(BKAG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung des Bundesamtes f\u00fcr Sicher-\nheit in der Informationstechnik (BSIG), Gesetz \u00fcber das Zoll-\nkriminalamt und die Zollfahndungs\u00e4mter (Zollfahndungs-\ndienstgesetz \u2013 ZFdG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Bundesnachrichtendienst \n(BND-Gesetz \u2013 BNDG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Zusammenarbeit des Bun-\ndes und der L\u00e4nder in Angelegenheiten des Verfassungsschutzes \nund \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (Bundesverfas-\nsungsschutzgesetz \u2013 BVerfSchG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Milit\u00e4rischen \nAbschirmdienst (MAD-Gesetz \u2013 MADG), Verordnung \u00fcber die \n\u00dcbermittlung von Ausk\u00fcnften an die Nachrichtendienste des \nBundes (Nachrichtendienste-\u00dcbermittlungsverordnung \u2013 ND\u00dcV). \n96  Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Regulation of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals \nwith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement \nof such data (General Data Protection Regulation), document 5455/16 \n(Brussels, 28 January 2016). \nprotection law, data protection authorities will in \nfuture be able to impose drastic fines on companies. \nSuch authorities are playing an ever more important \nrole as instances for complaints and control because \nthey verify how personal data are handled and can \ninitiate sanctions.97 Their independence therefore \nneeds to be reinforced and the influence of private-\nsector companies on them needs to be restricted. The \nECJ has clarified in two decisions (2010 and 2012) that \ndata protection officials and their agencies must enjoy \n\u201ccomplete independence\u201d.98 \nCivilian Response \nThe data required to launch a criminal prosecution \nare not only generated through IT methods in the \nrespective country. Any EU member state launching a \nprosecution will also always access data sources that \nwere generated in allied states under different legal \ncircumstances and do not meet the strict German or \nEuropean requirements for data protection.

It is pointless to stand \nalone, for the simple reason that Germany does not \nhave sufficient negotiating power in the multilateral \nor Internet Governance fora.

The location of each server therefore has little \nimpact on the security or privacy of communications. \nEstablished certification standards are much more im-\nportant. Users can encrypt emails, establish single-use \nemail adresses115 or rely on De-mail.116 Nevertheless, \nstates are claiming the right to access encrypted com-\nmunications in criminal prosecutions and therefore to \nbuild \u201cbackdoors\u201d117 into the systems of suspects. Even \nwell-encrypted emails generate metadata, which yield \na lot of information about their sender, receiver, sub-\njects and time. Security services such as the NSA col-\nlect such data on a grand scale. Much work is being \ncarried out on encryption technologies to make this \ntask more difficult.118 Users themselves play a decisive \nrole in civilising communications. They can exert \npressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated \nand fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes \nsense for the Internet Governance committees to dis-\ncuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It \nwould be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet \nGovernance or to allow states to exert increasing \ninfluence over it, with the exception of state bodies \nwanting to comply with due diligence. Fundamental-\nly, however, Internet Governance remains in the \nhands of private actors for the time being. \n \n115  Provisional email addresses are also offered under the \nnames of disposable email or instant email. They are intended \nas much as possible to limit the loss of personal data when a loss \nof integrity, meaning a falsification of information, occurs with \nwebsite operators. \n116  The Federal Government implemented the European direc-\ntive 2006/123/EC on service provisions in the internal market via \nthe De-Mail (De-Mail-G, 28 April 2011). Using De-mail, messages \nand documents can be sent and received confidentially, securely \nand verifiably.

First and foremost, this concerns \ncritical infrastructure and personal civil rights (and \nliberties). Since the 9/11 attacks, the UN has passed a \ngreat number of resolutions in the fight against terror-\nism that could serve as points of departure for cyber-\nsecurity as well. \nGermany has ratified the Council of Europe\u2019s Buda-\npest Convention on Cybercrime119 and backs the EU\u2019s \ncybersecurity strategy of February 2013.120 which uses \nthe same approach as Germany, namely a cybersecu-\nrity policy that is defensive and police-based in orien-\ntation. So far, the EU has limited itself to coordinating \nthe effort to create \u201can open, secure and protected \ncyberspace\u201d by focusing on a) creating resilient IT \nstructures, b) fighting cybercrime, c) developing defen-\nsive cybercapacities, d) promoting industrial and tech-\nnological developments in cybersecurity, and e) devel-\noping international cyberdiplomacy.121 The success \nand prospects of Europe\u2019s internal security depend on \nit acting at the national, European and international \nlevels whilst making use of the technological possibil-\nities of information exchange between these levels \nand giving that exchange legal protection. The glob-\nalisation, automation and industrialisation of crime \nrequire international and European coordination, \nespecially structural information exchanges between \nthe prosecuting authorities.122 \nEuropean Coordination \nTo enforce due diligence in the fight against cyber-\ncrime, substantive criminal law must urgently be \nharmonised, above all the definition of a criminal \noffence.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-\nnal offences using intergovernmental agreements of \nindividual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed \nis a process that involves all EU states and orientates \nitself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-\nity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and \npolitical system still rests on criminal law applying \nand operating within national borders. At the same \ntime, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access \nrights because cloud services, for example, operate \nbeyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-\ncentrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while \napplying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are \na number of further meaningful initiatives, such as \nthe European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-\npean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual \nlegal assistance agreements, including all relevant \ntransatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies \nfrom relocating their business abroad and thus cir-\ncumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-\nsecurity standards (the NIS directive) should be brought \ninto line with those set in the US by the National Insti-\ntute of Standards. Transatlantic cooperation has an \nimportant role to play not only in public-private part-\nnerships, but also at the official level, for instance in \nthe EU-US working group on fighting cybercrime.123 \nInclusiveness \nSecurity agencies on the EU and national levels will \nhave to get used to the fact that the fight against \ncybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-\ntion of private actors. A clear separation between \nprivate and public sector can hardly be upheld in this \narea, because the companies that have been attacked \nare frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nresolving cyber attacks.

According to the strategy the relevant \nagencies need to be given more supranational com-\npetences and more funds. These include Europol\u2019s \nEuropean Cybercrime Centre (EC3)128; the European \nNetwork and Information Security Agency (ENISA); \nand the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit \n(Eurojust). The cyberexercises that are regularly co-\nordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they \nare important for building resilient IT structures in \naccordance with due diligence. 29 EU-EFTA member \nstates and 200 governmental organisations participated \nin the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise.129 The exercise was \ndesigned to test how to improve cooperation between \nstates in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the \nwhole of Europe; how the many parallel communica-\ntions relations impact on generating an overview of \nthe national and European situation; and what con-\nsequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might \nhave for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. \nAt the operative level, the continuous cooperation of \nthe IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispen-\nsable. The BSI, for instance, is a member of the Euro-\npean Government CERTs Group (EGC), an informal \ngroup at the European level, and of the Forum for \nIncident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), an in-\nternational coalition of about 200 state and private \nCERTS.130 \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the \nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence \n(CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the \nAlliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of \nGerman academics, the Centre presented proposals \n \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. \neuropa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-\n1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA \nCE2014.

For example, the Tallinn \nManual states that \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow \nthe cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under \nits exclusive governmental control to be used for acts \nthat adversely and unlawfully affect other States.\u201d \nIn line with its constitutional obligation to defend \nthe Alliance, the German military also primarily has \ndefensive cybercapabilities, meaning that it is geared \nfor cyberdefence.132 Cyberdefence includes measures \nfor repelling threats not just against individual per-\nsons or enterprises but also against the state and its \nsocial foundations. The German armed forces view \nthemselves as the central instance for repelling exter-\nnal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-\nmany\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use \nand the German share of cyberspace are also part of \ncyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not \nonly that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out \nin cyberspace, but also that military deployments are \noccurring below the threshold of armed conflict and \nthat non-state actors are involved. The German Federal \nGovernment therefore explicitly points out that mili-\ntary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nGermany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \ndiligence. National measures intended to check and \nincrease the quality of the components and key tech-\nnologies in use should be based on the clarification \nand exchange of information within the EU, and \nbetween the EU and NATO.

In Ger-\nmany, this concerns primarily Art 87a GG and Art 24 \npara 2 GG. If these preconditions are met, it is legally \npossible to take damaging (counter-)measures against \nan attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gather-\ning and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German \narmed forces can use their own capacities to protect \nthe whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this \nis Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the \narmed forces to repel and cope with a particularly \ngrave incident. However, each armed deployment of \nGerman military forces requires the assent of the Ger-\nman Parliament under a law known as the Parlaments-\nbeteiligungsgesetz.140 In developing a German cyber-\ndefence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early \non about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal \nprecondition of parliamentary approval that exists in \nGermany is a major asset that must not carelessly be \nsacrificed to technological progress. In this context, \nthere needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval \nafter the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal \nConstitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah deci-\nsion141 in the summer of 2015. This dealt with the pos-\nsibility of informing the German Parliament only in \nretrospect in cases where there is \u201cGefahrenverzug\u201d, \nmeaning looming danger. \nCivilian Response \nIn times of peace, due diligence in cyberdefence \nmeans pursuing primarily civilian approaches to the \npreventative and reactive protection of one\u2019s IT sys-\ntems and infrastructure. However, Germany is also \narming itself militarily for cyberspace.

The manner in \nwhich the capabilities to be created are strategically \nand operationally integrated into the German armed \nforces will therefore be decisive. \nDeveloping International Norms \nDeveloping international norms is a central part of \nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy. Germany ex-\nports technological products worldwide and receives \nprimary products from almost all of the world\u2019s coun-\ntries. However, since adjusting to standards always has \nits costs, it is very much in Germany\u2019s interests wher-\never possible to turn its own standards into the inter-\nnational norm. For this, its international cyber policy \nacts in three areas. Its first goal is to reach agreements \nwith third parties on confidence and security-building \nmeasures. Its second aims is to conclude agreements \nthat set international standards for the approval of \nhardware and software and define norms for respon-\nsible conduct by states. Its third target is applying \ninternational law in cyberspace. \nEuropean Cooperation \nFor the cyberdefence policy to enforce due diligence \nin cyberspace, the EU needs to be placed in a position \nwhere it can engage more closely in developing inter-\nnational norms. In April 2015, the EU\u2019s High Repre-\nsentative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Fede-\nrica Mogherini, and the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert \nKoenders emphatically pointed out the necessity of \ntaking states up on their promise for their behaviour \nin cyberspace. Mogherini and Koenders believe that \ninsufficiently secured central infrastructure is a threat \nto national and international security.149 In this, they \nrepresent all 28 member states, which have agreed on \nthis line in cyberdiplomacy.150 \nHowever, constructive criticism on the global level \nis extremely difficult because there are such divergent \nviews throughout the world on various aspects of in-\nformation security.

As a European middle-size power, \nGermany will only be able to find this new focus in a \nperspective that is in keeping with its integration in \nEuropean Union, democratic values and firm commit-\nment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence \nnorm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nand global character of a good international cyber and \ncybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic \nfoundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security \npolicies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-\ngence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental \nidea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility \nfor threats that emanate from their territory and must \ndo everything in their power in cooperation with \nother EU states and allies to prevent damage to third \nparties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-\ntures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and \nbring together a great number of interested parties. \nIn digital industrial policy cooperation between state \nand private actors with the aim of pooling profession-\nal expertise is needed to give due diligence greater \nweight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence \nof civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for \nimproving Germany\u2019s International and European \ncyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly \nenforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal \nstandard and is not included as a binding regulation \nin bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final \nreport of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, \nthe represented states commit to stopping attacks that \nemanate from their territories and also commit to not \ndeliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-\nstructure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-\ncrime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a \npromising step that can serve as a model for bilateral \nagreements between other countries. Here, it will be \nimportant to work politically towards a general recog-\nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary \ninstitutional structures in the medium term to guar-\nantee that the norm is being applied effectively. The \nGerman Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role \nin coordinating an international cyber policy and \ncyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only depart-\nment that rises above the sectional perspectives of \nindividual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial re-\nsponsibility. \nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy should be formulated even more strong-\nly inside EU structures. Only because of the European \nsingle market is Germany able to act with the neces-\nsary vigour on the international stage. A promising \nstarting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group \n(FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support \nthe implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-\nzontally at the EU level. While the working group has \nso far only been set up for three years at a time, it has \nalready become the most important hub for coordi-\nnating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU \nand USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-\nnational norms. Where they agree, they have enough \npolitical influence to tilt the scales towards a more \neffective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently \nneeded now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-\ntion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally \nattributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently \nuse this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by \nshifting the blame onto third parties. In line with \nthe TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer \nand a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance \nneed to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-\ntion Regulation should quickly be complemented by \nPrivacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets \nthe legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-\ntion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account \nthe legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision \nof October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-\npanies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU \nhas defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data \nbeing stored and evaluated according to US law.

With this decision, the EU will applys its own \nlaw on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial \neffects of national law contradict the principle of due \ndiligence obligations. States such as the US and China \nare likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-\ning legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This \ncould result in a collision course for different national \nlegal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-\ntion of the global economic space and the Internet. \nThe Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-\ntic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are \ntherefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed \non those states which have been attacked, on whose \nterritory the servers are located, or over whose data \ncables attacks are carried out. The density of these \nobligations should depend on the ability of the states \nin questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-\nities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-\ntive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, \nIT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point. This would also reduce legal un-\ncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must \nbe possible to force companies to make their software \nproducts more secure. At the very least, the criteria for \ntransparency, testing and certification must be made \nmore stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA. \nFourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected \nweapons systems and the high quality that detected \ncyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity \nknow-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to \ntake data security into account at the design stage of \nany system architecture. It therefore stands to reason \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further \ndevelopment and use of cyberdefence systems. How-\never, this should be coordinated at the European level, \napproved by politically independent or parliamentary \ndecisions, and remain committed to an exclusively \ndefensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct \nwould run counter to due diligence and would also \nbreak with the tradition of military restraint in for-\neign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in \nall issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-\nrity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-\nment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as \npart of their cyberdefence, the political change of \ncourse that might be required for this would need to \nbe debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-\nsupposes social resilience, which can only be created \nthrough public debate. This also includes carrying out \na reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-\nment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. \nIt will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-\ntures for parliamentary oversight. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

To create and preserve the Internet as a \npublic good, concerted global action is needed on the \nbasis of a common norm, which makes states mutu-\nally responsible for their diligence in national regula-\ntory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in \nthe German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as \nthe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides \nfor civil, police and military-defensive approaches to \nprotecting information-technology (IT) systems and \ninfrastructure. \nIn the course of the discussion about a new German \ncybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn \nof this year, a growing number of political voices have \nalso argued that political regulation and digital sover-\neignty should be strengthened and renationalised. Poli-\ntics must face up to the reality of the military becom-\ning increasingly operative in cyberspace. This will be \nreflected in the German Federal Government\u2019s new \nWhite Paper as well as in NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s future \ncyberdefence. In other words, it will be implemented \nin the German and European security policy as well as \nin their defence missions and military procurement. \nLiberal democracies need to be aware that the idea \nof a free and open Internet can only be realized if \nthere is consensus among a \u201ccoalition of liberal states\u201d \nnot only on how the Internet should be governend but \nwhy International and transatlantic cooperation is \nmeaningful.

The political \nrules adopted for an international cyber policy and \ncybersecurity policy will always lag behind techno-\nlogical developments. It is the more important, there-\nfore, that new regulations be subordinated to an over-\narching norm. Three crucial political requirements \narise from this: \n\uf034 European cooperation: integrating national policies \ninto the European framework; \n\uf034 Inclusiveness: giving different interest groups broad \nand publicly accessible representation in formulat-\ning policies; \n\uf034 Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-\nponent over the military component, particularly \nin times of peace. \n \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states \nbehave responsibly not only towards one another, but \nalso in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. \nThe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided \nfor this. As part of implementing the EU directive on \nnetwork and information security (NIS), all EU states \nmust introduce minimum standards and reporting \nrequirements for IT security, and operators of critical \ninfrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national \nregulations in civil law (data protection), commercial \nlaw (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-\nmestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-\nfil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, \nit will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned \nGlobal Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members \nlargely agree that states are responsible for their own \nbehaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation \namong Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as \nwell as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN \nGGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE \nnegotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-\ncrime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The \nminimum conditions for global cybersecurity are \nratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as \nwell as continuous confidence- and security-building \nmeasures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, \nwhich was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the \nInformation Society) follow-up process, showed that a \nworldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term. Therefore, \nthe decision taken in December 2015 to continue the \nInternet Governance Forum \u2013 in other words, to keep \npursuing the multi-stakeholder approach \u2013 still offers \nthe best chance of preventing the idea of a global free \nand open Internet from falling victim to governments\u2019 \nintensifying security considerations. In Internet Gov-\nernance, it is therefore crucial to support the multi-\nstakeholder approach (interpreted inclusively) and to \nreject the principle of intergovernmental decision-\nmaking. The experience of the WSIS process of the past \nten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of inter-\ngovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-\ning on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \noperators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-\nerly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-\ngy to protect the economy and industry against espio-\nnage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-\nbilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense \nindicates that it wants to build additional defensive \ncapabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not \nbe advisable for the government to evolve towards \nan offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in \nopen contradiction with the idea of due diligence \nin cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the \nrisk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber \nattacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-\ncult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause \nserious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on \nthe German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is \nto persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring \na given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse \nto NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against \nIslamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last \nresorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to \nprop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-\nrity technology, for developing digital forensics, and \nfor extensive further-training measures to heighten \nawareness among civil servants, scientists, academics \nand researchers. Confidence-building measures within \nthe OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under \nthe leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-\nsified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving \nbilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-\ning and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and \nremove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of \nthis is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ning cybercrime. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Or \nmore simply, due diligence refers to your activities \nto identify and understand the risks facing your \norganization. Such due diligence obligations may \nexist between states, between non-state actors (e.g., \nprivate corporations), and between state and non-\nstate actors.

According \nto the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-\ntories, and especially the computersystems and infra-\nstructure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 \ncontrol, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-\nture of other states.13 \nDue diligence is usually translated in international \nlaw treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-\npflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions \non one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful \nto use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The \nprinciple of due diligence derives its particular norma-\ntive force from the idea that states are not only respon-\nsible for keeping law and order on their own territories, \nbut also bear responsibility for the external consequences of \n \n10  International Court of Justice, \u201cCase Concerning Pulp Mills \non the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Decisions taken by individual states \nincreasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-\nritory. That is why states must exercise care with such \ndecisions and be accountable to one another for them. \nAs far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply \nlimit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. \nThis study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-\nnet needs to the political will by all stakeholders for \ninternational cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in \ncooperation with other states are obliged to do every-\nthing that may be reasonably expected of them to \nhelp deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \nThis expectation encompasses decision-making \nprocesses that meet high standards. This means that \navailable competences should be integrated as far as \npossible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics \nshould be avoided.16 In other words, an international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due \ndiligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode \nof regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy \nand cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated \nat the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated \ninto inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17 \n\uf034 Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \nwith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\nness as well as transparency.

Especially in \ntimes of crisis, the so-called rallying effect is an \nindispensable element of democratic resilience.\u201d19 \nHowever, the inclusiveness of legislative processes \nshould stop wherever private-sector actors start \nexerting a dominant influence on legislative bod-\nies.20 This can only be countered with transparent \nand representative processes that also give other \nstates a minimum of certainty that their legitimate \ninterests are being taken into consideration. The \nopenness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-\nmental prerequisite for states trusting one another \nso that they can deliver their individual contribu-\ntions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure \ncyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy \nto meet. In a technically challenging area such as \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, \nconsultations often need to be confidential. Fur-\nthermore, the expertise of large companies almost \ninevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-\ndinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or \nmembers of parliament to be accepted as compe-\ntent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore \nrequired to prevent one-sided representations of \ninterests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \nindustry.21 \nA maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign \npolicy states that regulatory practices should be co-\nordinated as closely as possible with its most impor-\ntant European partners.22 The internal market is so \ntightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 \nas indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that \nindividual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are \n \n19  Christopher Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolg-\nreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d, lecture given at \nthe CyberLab of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of \nexceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting \nof the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-\nnated in entire passages of text from trade-association position \npapers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative \nact. Patrick Beuth, \u201cBundesregierung hofiert Lobbyisten\u201d, Zeit \nOnline, 10 March 2015, http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/ \n2015-03/eu-datenschutzgrundverordnung-ministerrat-\nbundesregierung-lobbyplag (accessed 30 November 2015). \n21  Liz Alderman, \u201cTerror Threats Thaw Budgets across Europe\u201d, \nNew York Times, 31 January 2016. \n22  Recommended reading on Germany\u2019s self-perception in \nforeign policy is Gunther Hellmann, \u201cGermany\u2019s World: Power \nand Followership in a Crisis-Ridden Europa\u201d, Global Affairs 2, no. 1 \n(2016): 3\u201320. \nineffective in comparison to a regional European \napproach. \n\uf034 Through its international cyber policy, Germany \nintends to achieve effective collaboration on cyber-\nsecurity in Europe and across the world. German \nmeasures to promote a free and secure Internet \nshould therefore always be integrated at the Euro-\npean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously \nclaim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-\ntiating power on the global stage if it coordinates \nintensively with the leading European cybernations \n(France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, \nSpain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such \nas the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber \nIssues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-\nordinated at the European level can prevent global-\nisation and digitalisation from aggravating the \nsymptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany \nthat the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-\nspace24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-\nfies that states should not merely orientate themselves \nalong national interests, but also think in the catego-\nries of global public good. Germany\u2019s tradition of \ncivilian power25 is perpetuated in its international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy as well. \n\uf034 The German Federal Republic has always held to \nthe principle of generally pursuing its interests \nthrough economic and political rather than mili-\ntary means. In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy is one that tries to civilise inter-\nnational policy in cyberspace. That would mean \ninternationalising socially accepted norms as much \nas possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n \n23  The FoP Cyber was created in 2013 for a three-year period as \na permanent body to monitor the implementation of Europe\u2019s \ncyberstrategy. The group has evolved into the most important EU \nforum for discussing and following up on all cybertopics. \n24  On this point, see inter alia Ronald J.

Responding to cyber attacks \nwith automatic counterattacks and digital acts of \nreprisal would be extremely problematic. For one \nthing, any attempt to attribute cyber attacks un-\nequivocally raises all sorts of technical, legal and \npolitical questions; for another, counterattacks can \nhave serious side-effects. Active cyberdefence might \nprovoke a digital arms race \u2013 for instance through \nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs27) \u2013 with incalcu-\nlable risks for fragile critical infrastructure.

In September \n2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen \nconfirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for \ncyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-\ntry\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned \nfor specific military cyber operations. There are also \nplans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) \nan expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-\nment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose \na risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for \nduty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-\nnent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \n\u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence \nservice\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider \non security issues, and it advises and supports the \nGerman armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and \non foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main \nbodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity \nstrategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-\nligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-\nmittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-\ntee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-\nmittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics \nof the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace \nmakes no distinction between domestic and foreign \npolicy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy \nand the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means \nof attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-\nputer programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, \ndisrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications \nsystems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-\nmation from data sources that are not publicly available. CNOs \nare therefore subdivided into Computer Network Attacks (CNA), \nComputer Network Defence (CND) and Computer Network \nExploitation (CNE). \n45  Federal Ministry of Defence, \u201cTagesbefehl der Ministerin: \nBundeswehr wird im Cyber-Raum zukunftsf\u00e4hig\u201d (Berlin, 17 Sep-\ntember 2015). \n46  Ibid. \n47  Andre Meister, \u201cGeheime Cyber-Leitlinie: Verteidigungsminis-\nterium erlaubt Bundeswehr \u2018Cyberwar\u2019 und offensive digitale \nAngriffe\u201d, netzpolitik.org, 30 July 2015, https://netzpolitik.org/ \n2015/geheime-cyber-leitlinie-verteidigungsministerium-erlaubt-\nbundeswehr-cyberwar-und-offensive-digitale-angriffe/ (accessed \n30 November 2015). \n48  \u201cGeheimhaltung versus Transparenz\u201d, Beh\u00f6rden Spiegel \n(November 2015): 48. \nboth conceptually and institutionally. Domestic policy \nshould be adjusted in accordance with due diligence. \nThis is the only way of restoring the citizens\u2019, allies\u2019 \nand EU partners\u2019 trust lost during the Edward Snow-\nden leaks. Trust is an indispensable prerequisite for \nEuropean cooperation and politics. However, the im-\nplementation of the three major challenges to an \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 \nnamely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-\nian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to \nestablish an overview of the cyber threat situation are \nunsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more \nsuccessful, proposals have been put forward to trans-\nform the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-\nbrella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint \nAnti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently \nbring together all federal and state authorities. There \nare also calls for more cooperation between national \nand EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, \nsuch as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany \nnot only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d \nfrequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part \nof the European coordination. Moreover, vital coordi-\nnation at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because \nthe attribution of specific responsibilities is so com-\nplicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, \ncoalition partners have been discussing whether Ger-\nmany needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital \nagency.50 However, they have only been able to agree \non an office without power or resources: the office \nof Digital Champion of the Federal Government, cur-\nrently held by Gesche Joost. \n \n49  Since 2011, the European External Action Service has been \nresponsible for the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), \nwhich produces civilian situation analyses for EU decision-\nmakers based on material delivered by national intelligence \nservices.

In part, these reforms have \nonly become public knowledge through leaked docu-\nments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-\ntional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February \n2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-\nbohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views \nhis links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times \nthe resources available for the offensive approach than \nthere are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks \nor compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a \nmember of the executive board of the Federal Associa-\ntion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-\ntions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only \none in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-\ncies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-\nnies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to \ncontact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather \nthan the police, since the latter would have to launch \na preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act \nwas suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-\ning the intelligence services as well as improving par-\nliamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55 \n \n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range \nlaunched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal \nnetzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason. However, the case was \ndropped after political intervention.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-\nj\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated \nfor regulating the exchange of information by intel-\nligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to \nbe created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-\nperson for the armed forces.56 \nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of \nthe Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised \nthat it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT \nsecurity, but that the BMI had overall control on issues \nof cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being \nquestioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. \nEven the National Cybersecurity Council has not been \nable to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient \ndistribution of resposibilities. In July 2013, while eluci-\ndating the NSA affair, the German Federal Govern-\nment did publish an eight-point programme on im-\nproving protection of the private sphere.57 However, \nthe Cybersecurity Council did not publicly take a \nposition on the questionable practices of the security \nservices \u2013 for instance, committing industrial espio-\nnage58 or keeping selector lists with spying targets.59 \n \n56  Rudi Wais, \u201cSo k\u00f6nnte eine bessere Kontrolle der Nachrich-\ntendienste aussehen\u201d, Augsburger Allgemeine, 3 May 2015, http:// \nwww.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/So-koennte-eine-bessere-\nKontrolle-der-Nachrichtendienste-aussehen-id33933952.html \n(accessed 30 November 2015). \n57  Federal Ministry of Defence/Federal Ministry of Industry \nand Technology, Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr einen besseren Schutz der Privat-\nsph\u00e4re, Fortschrittsbericht (Berlin, 14 August 2013), http:// \nwww.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Nachrichten/ \nPressemitteilungen/2013/08/bericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile. \n58  German Federal Parliament, Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die \nKleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Jan Korte, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Hahn, Ulla Jelpke, \nweiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

Many observers had expected a more \nproportionate reaction to the attack on Germany\u2019s \nhighest constitutional body. \nDigital Industrial Policy and the Importance \nof Private Actors \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional \nstructures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated \ncapabilities in information and communications tech-\nnology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 \nOver the past few decades, automisation has allowed \nthe German economy to respond well to the global \npressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal \nMinistry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost \nsmall and medium enterprises using its Digital Strat-\negy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily im-\nportant role in the Federal Government\u2019s international \ncybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in stra-\ntegic importance. The companies located there not \nonly create jobs and added value, but also set com-\npetitivity standards for whole economies.61 The Ger-\nman Federal Government believes that there is still \nplenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: \naccording to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for \nSystems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Net-\nworks could generate overall benefits to German \nsociety worth 56 million euros a year.62 \nHowever, other countries have digitalised more \nsuccessfully. The pioneering companies are mostly \nAmerican, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the \nGerman Federal Government launched the pro-\ngrammes Digital Agenda and Digital Management. \nHowever, these programmes are meagrely equipped \n \nJelpke, weiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal fund-\ning to the tune of around 200 million euros from the \nBMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to \nmake them competitive. It must be remembered that, \nto meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated \ninto European harmonisation and needs to focus on a \ndefensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThere has been criticism from the academia that \n\u201cthe Industrie 4.0 discourse [is] often too technical \nand national\u201d,63 and that it needed to be more closely \ninterconnected at the EU level than hitherto, because \nwhere (critical) infrastructure was concerned, solu-\ntions for data security, operational safety and data \nprotection were not being brought together.64 This is \nalso reflected in the Federal Government\u2019s programme \nDigital Agenda 2014\u20132017.

Their special focus is first \nand foremost the German industrial policy. However, \nIndustrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only \nbe designed at the European or even global level.68 \nIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a \nstrategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this \nmarket, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros \nto EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the \nCommission currently has only limited means avail-\nable for developing key digital technologies. The Con-\nnecting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for \nresearch for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the \nJuncker Commission took up its posts in November \n2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the \nhelp of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-\nmission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the \nmarket, as well as distributive policies should be got \noff the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the \nnecessary speed is a problem, however, because the \nCommission first has to harmonise the legal policies \nof all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions \npublished by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in \n2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a \nEuropean or transatlantic agreement on data-security \nand data protection policy.Important decisions in this \ncontext are those on the illegality of telecommunica-\ntions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and \non the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, \nIndustrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und \nforschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente \nVernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache \n18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nSch\u00f6ssler and Ben Scott, eds., Kompendium Industrie 4.0.

The direc-\ntive is intended to make IT more secure for operators \nof critical infrastructure and large online service pro-\nviders, and will oblige affected companies to report \nany security and data protection events or IT attacks. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-\nnet. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-\ntration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, \nbut not social networks. Small digital companies are \nalso excluded. According to the directive, member \nstates will have to build national reporting systems \nand exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-\ntent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific \nComputer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) \nin addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-\nvolved. The German Federal Government used the \nlong negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a \nsolution nationally with its industry, before the EU \nagreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed \nits IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced \nreporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and \nminimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-\nture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-\nties and private companies working in the area of \ncritical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It \nis especially questionable whether the private sector \ncan self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to \nbecome dependent on the interests of individual pri-\nvate actors to the point where they are barely able to \nact meaningfully without them.77 This dependency \nbecomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these \ncompanies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO \nhave so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy \nin these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-\nvidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great \nBritain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on \ndeterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-\nveillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-\nsions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-\npretations could potentially result from this, since \ntechnical, political and legal reasons make it almost \nimpossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, \ncyberinsecurity is growing within the international \ncommunity. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-\ntect their citizens and data; and at the same time they \nhave to regulate the digital sector, which is largely \ndominated by private companies. Creating universally \nsecure components is considered extremely difficult, \nbut where software is used by the state, transparency, \ntesting and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce \nfrom this state of affairs which are the most important \nareas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-\nrights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, \nfighting cybercrime; and developing international \nnorms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and \nin terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise \nfrom this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-\nsibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in \nthe policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-\nes in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence \nmeans taking to heart the three demands of European \ncooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85 \nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-\nral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and \nsecurity policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness. The examples \nlisted only serve to illustrate the requirements named, which each \npolicy would have to meet according to due diligence principles. \n86  Ben Wagner, \u201cFreedom of Expression on the Internet: Implica-\ntions for Foreign Policy\u201d, Global Information Society Watch (2011): 20\u201322. \nvery latest since the revelations made by the former \nNSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even \nwestern secret services carry out passive surveillance \non a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly \ninfiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organi-\nsations such as Freedom House with its annual study \nFreedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or \nactivists for free software remind us again and again \nthat governments and globally active IT corporations \ndo not provide continual barrier-free Internet access \nacross the world. These organisations claim, for \ninstance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only \ngives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand \nthat Internet access should be a basic human right; \nat the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far \nfrom reaching a conclusion.87 \nIn a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights \nCouncil emphasised that human rights are valid in \nthe same way online as they are offline.88 In November \n2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN \nGeneral Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in \nthe digital age, in which, among other things, it pro-\nscribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic.89 \nIn May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom \nof expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption \nof private communications to be made a standard.

One com-\nmentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the \nlaw\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between \ncivil liberties and security measures during states of \nemergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-\nporteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to \nprivacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the \nlong term, integrated economic areas also need inte-\ngrated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty \ngives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-\ndom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-\nened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was \nlegally binding on the EU and came into force at the \nsame time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-\ngation on the EU to ratify the European Convention \nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental \nFreedoms. What holds true for the single market also \nholds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where \nthe transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU \nand USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy \nShield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic \nagreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, \nwhich might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-\nvant data and information. Intensive cooperation \namong law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed \nto fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-\nism, such as digital financial services providers, can \nonly be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely \non information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist \nFinance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-\nment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes \nand modernised mutual legal assistance agreements \n(MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive \ncooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n \n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche \nZeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and \nthe United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial \nMessaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the \nPurposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, \n27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-\ntive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nprehensive cooperation between the security services \n(as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, \nhowever, be subject to more stringent parliamentary \ncontrols. It is not in the interests of due diligence to \nhave secret services exchange their insights informally \nand, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for \ninstance those stipulated in agreements providing for \nmutual legal assistance.94 \nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human \nrights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to \nhave laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, \nat least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-\nmany and Europe, data protection is directly linked to \nthe right to informational self-determination whereby \ncitizens have a say in how their personal data may be \nused. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, \nbecause the state has a duty of protection towards its \ncitizens that it must fulfil. Technically speaking, data \nprotection and the state\u2019s protective duties associated \nwith it differ by area: international economic inter-\n \nName Record Data for the Prevention, Detection, Investigation and Pros-\necution of Terrorist Offences and Serious Crime, 14670/15 (Brussels, \n2 December 2015). \n93  This is the most significant secret-services cooperation in \nthe world, between the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia \nand New Zealand.

Specific arrangements are made in each \nof these areas because of the threat each poses to indi-\nvidual freedoms and security; these arrangements in \nturn have an impact on how inclusive the regulations \nare.95 \nData protection has become an area of law for \nwhich responsibility within the EU is divided. Legally \nbinding data protection provisions between states \nhave so far only been concluded at a regional level, \nnamely in 1981 in the shape of the European Council\u2019s \nconvention on data protection. \nThe trialogue between representatives of the Com-\nmission, the European Parliament and the Council of \nthe European Union led to an agreement in December \n2015 on a package of reforms for data protection in \nthe shape of the General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR96), which replaced the EU\u2019s data protection \ndirective of 1995. The new Regulation will have to be \ntransposed directly into national law as of 2018. The \nGDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-\nlates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data \nprocessing by the police and judicial authorities of the \nEU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-\non of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other \nuses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-\nknown examples of this practice are the large digital-\nservice providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-\nbook, which store the data of European clients in the \nUS using data protection provisions that violate Euro-\npean law. Where there are grave violations of the data \n \n95  Alongside the relevant paragraphs in Germany\u2019s Basic Law, \nthe legal bases can be found in the primary legislation on the \nsecurity services, police and other authorities: Bundesdaten-\nschutzgesetz (BDSG), Telekommunikationsgesetz (TKG), Gesetz \nzur Beschr\u00e4nkung des Brief-, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses \n(Artikel 10-Gesetz \u2013 G10), Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundeskriminalamt \n(BKAG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung des Bundesamtes f\u00fcr Sicher-\nheit in der Informationstechnik (BSIG), Gesetz \u00fcber das Zoll-\nkriminalamt und die Zollfahndungs\u00e4mter (Zollfahndungs-\ndienstgesetz \u2013 ZFdG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Bundesnachrichtendienst \n(BND-Gesetz \u2013 BNDG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Zusammenarbeit des Bun-\ndes und der L\u00e4nder in Angelegenheiten des Verfassungsschutzes \nund \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (Bundesverfas-\nsungsschutzgesetz \u2013 BVerfSchG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Milit\u00e4rischen \nAbschirmdienst (MAD-Gesetz \u2013 MADG), Verordnung \u00fcber die \n\u00dcbermittlung von Ausk\u00fcnften an die Nachrichtendienste des \nBundes (Nachrichtendienste-\u00dcbermittlungsverordnung \u2013 ND\u00dcV). \n96  Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Regulation of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals \nwith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement \nof such data (General Data Protection Regulation), document 5455/16 \n(Brussels, 28 January 2016). \nprotection law, data protection authorities will in \nfuture be able to impose drastic fines on companies. \nSuch authorities are playing an ever more important \nrole as instances for complaints and control because \nthey verify how personal data are handled and can \ninitiate sanctions.97 Their independence therefore \nneeds to be reinforced and the influence of private-\nsector companies on them needs to be restricted. The \nECJ has clarified in two decisions (2010 and 2012) that \ndata protection officials and their agencies must enjoy \n\u201ccomplete independence\u201d.98 \nCivilian Response \nThe data required to launch a criminal prosecution \nare not only generated through IT methods in the \nrespective country. Any EU member state launching a \nprosecution will also always access data sources that \nwere generated in allied states under different legal \ncircumstances and do not meet the strict German or \nEuropean requirements for data protection. While \nincreased retention of data is viewed as an important \ninstrument in fighting cybercrime, it has been inad-\nmissible to inform on or survey transmission data \ngenerated in the past since the German Federal Court\u2019s \ndecision of 2 March 2010. On 8 April 2014, the ECJ also \nquashed the EU directive on data retention, arguing \nthat it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fun-\ndamental Rights. A draft law presented by Federal \nJustice Minister Heiko Maas in 2015 intends to store \nthe telecommunications data of all German citizens \nfor 10 weeks.99 Technically, the instrument is already \nalmost outdated. \n \n97  The federal commissioner for data protection and freedom \nof information is expected to control the data protection efforts \nof telecommunications and postal services providers, federal \nagencies and other public federal offices. Unlike his or her col-\nleagues at the state level, he or she will only be able to caution \noffenders, but not fine them. \n98  European Court of Justice, Judgment of the Court (Grand \nChamber).

A series of \nreforms of Internet Governance can be inferred from \nthe due diligence standard: \nEuropean Coordination \nThe German Federal Government should coordinate \nits national position with its EU partners and other \nstates, especially the OECD, to create the precondi-\ntions for asserting its views internationally at the UN \n(as it did, most recently, at the WSIS follow-up con-\nference in December 2015). It is pointless to stand \nalone, for the simple reason that Germany does not \nhave sufficient negotiating power in the multilateral \nor Internet Governance fora. The EU position was set \nin June 2011 when the European Commisssion declared \nthat the EU\u2019s aim was to create \u201ca single, un-fragmented \nnetwork, subject to the same laws and norms that \napply in other areas of our day-to-day lives\u201d.111 The EU \nand Germany are in favour of a leading role for the \nInternet Governance Forum, whose term was extended \nby another five years at the UN summit in December \n2015. This is intended to prevent intergovernmental \ninfluence from being exerted to the disadvantage of \n \n110  Correct as of 2014.

By this, the EU \nmeans engaging in an inclusive dialogue with develop-\ning, emerging and industrialised countries in terms \nof innovative best practices, with the goal of ensuring \nInternet access even in rural areas (capacity-building). \nWith the help of Internet Governance, it wants to con-\ntinually improve ICT even in less developed regions \nand parts of the world. \nInclusiveness \nInclusiveness and legitimacy are highly controversial \nin global Internet Governance.112 However, civil-\nsociety interest groups and members of parliament \nought to be involved in the setting of global Internet \nnorms, so that decisions are not only taken by \ntechnical bodies such as the Internet Architecture \nBoard. Inclusiveness is the only guarantee that the \nnecessary professional competence will be made \navailable and that social acceptance for the norm-\nsetting processes will be generated. Beyond this, \nIANA\u2019s function of assigning top-level domains \u2013 \nmeaning the highest level of name resolution, such as \n*.com or *.de \u2013 should be put on a footing acceptable \nto all.

The location of each server therefore has little \nimpact on the security or privacy of communications. \nEstablished certification standards are much more im-\nportant. Users can encrypt emails, establish single-use \nemail adresses115 or rely on De-mail.116 Nevertheless, \nstates are claiming the right to access encrypted com-\nmunications in criminal prosecutions and therefore to \nbuild \u201cbackdoors\u201d117 into the systems of suspects. Even \nwell-encrypted emails generate metadata, which yield \na lot of information about their sender, receiver, sub-\njects and time. Security services such as the NSA col-\nlect such data on a grand scale. Much work is being \ncarried out on encryption technologies to make this \ntask more difficult.118 Users themselves play a decisive \nrole in civilising communications. They can exert \npressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated \nand fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes \nsense for the Internet Governance committees to dis-\ncuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It \nwould be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet \nGovernance or to allow states to exert increasing \ninfluence over it, with the exception of state bodies \nwanting to comply with due diligence. Fundamental-\nly, however, Internet Governance remains in the \nhands of private actors for the time being. \n \n115  Provisional email addresses are also offered under the \nnames of disposable email or instant email. They are intended \nas much as possible to limit the loss of personal data when a loss \nof integrity, meaning a falsification of information, occurs with \nwebsite operators. \n116  The Federal Government implemented the European direc-\ntive 2006/123/EC on service provisions in the internal market via \nthe De-Mail (De-Mail-G, 28 April 2011). Using De-mail, messages \nand documents can be sent and received confidentially, securely \nand verifiably. De-mail is offered by various e-mail providers in \nGermany and can be used, among other things, for digital cor-\nrespondence with many ministries. E-Mail made in Germany.

First and foremost, this concerns \ncritical infrastructure and personal civil rights (and \nliberties). Since the 9/11 attacks, the UN has passed a \ngreat number of resolutions in the fight against terror-\nism that could serve as points of departure for cyber-\nsecurity as well. \nGermany has ratified the Council of Europe\u2019s Buda-\npest Convention on Cybercrime119 and backs the EU\u2019s \ncybersecurity strategy of February 2013.120 which uses \nthe same approach as Germany, namely a cybersecu-\nrity policy that is defensive and police-based in orien-\ntation. So far, the EU has limited itself to coordinating \nthe effort to create \u201can open, secure and protected \ncyberspace\u201d by focusing on a) creating resilient IT \nstructures, b) fighting cybercrime, c) developing defen-\nsive cybercapacities, d) promoting industrial and tech-\nnological developments in cybersecurity, and e) devel-\noping international cyberdiplomacy.121 The success \nand prospects of Europe\u2019s internal security depend on \nit acting at the national, European and international \nlevels whilst making use of the technological possibil-\nities of information exchange between these levels \nand giving that exchange legal protection. The glob-\nalisation, automation and industrialisation of crime \nrequire international and European coordination, \nespecially structural information exchanges between \nthe prosecuting authorities.122 \nEuropean Coordination \nTo enforce due diligence in the fight against cyber-\ncrime, substantive criminal law must urgently be \nharmonised, above all the definition of a criminal \noffence. Most EU member states have signed the Buda-\npest Convention and thus committed themselves to \nprosecuting offences occurring in cyberspace.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-\nnal offences using intergovernmental agreements of \nindividual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed \nis a process that involves all EU states and orientates \nitself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-\nity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and \npolitical system still rests on criminal law applying \nand operating within national borders. At the same \ntime, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access \nrights because cloud services, for example, operate \nbeyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-\ncentrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while \napplying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are \na number of further meaningful initiatives, such as \nthe European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-\npean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual \nlegal assistance agreements, including all relevant \ntransatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies \nfrom relocating their business abroad and thus cir-\ncumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-\nsecurity standards (the NIS directive) should be brought \ninto line with those set in the US by the National Insti-\ntute of Standards.

A clear separation between \nprivate and public sector can hardly be upheld in this \narea, because the companies that have been attacked \nare frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nresolving cyber attacks.

Where such a hunt is successful, \nattackers may be prevented from accessing the most \nsensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is \nstored in such a way that it can be used in court. \nGathering evidence from large and complex data \nbanks takes time and requires extremely powerful \ncomputers.

Frequently, this exchange of information is \nstill more of a one-way street, because small and \nmedium enterprises in particular do not have the \ncapacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \nIn Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are \nobliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \nminimum security standards for their IT. However, \nsecurity issues concerning software products and \nexternal cloud services have not yet been sufficiently \nresolved.

According to the strategy the relevant \nagencies need to be given more supranational com-\npetences and more funds. These include Europol\u2019s \nEuropean Cybercrime Centre (EC3)128; the European \nNetwork and Information Security Agency (ENISA); \nand the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit \n(Eurojust). The cyberexercises that are regularly co-\nordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they \nare important for building resilient IT structures in \naccordance with due diligence. 29 EU-EFTA member \nstates and 200 governmental organisations participated \nin the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise.129 The exercise was \ndesigned to test how to improve cooperation between \nstates in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the \nwhole of Europe; how the many parallel communica-\ntions relations impact on generating an overview of \nthe national and European situation; and what con-\nsequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might \nhave for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. \nAt the operative level, the continuous cooperation of \nthe IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispen-\nsable. The BSI, for instance, is a member of the Euro-\npean Government CERTs Group (EGC), an informal \ngroup at the European level, and of the Forum for \nIncident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), an in-\nternational coalition of about 200 state and private \nCERTS.130 \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the \nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence \n(CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the \nAlliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of \nGerman academics, the Centre presented proposals \n \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. \neuropa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-\n1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA \nCE2014.

For example, the Tallinn \nManual states that \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow \nthe cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under \nits exclusive governmental control to be used for acts \nthat adversely and unlawfully affect other States.\u201d \nIn line with its constitutional obligation to defend \nthe Alliance, the German military also primarily has \ndefensive cybercapabilities, meaning that it is geared \nfor cyberdefence.132 Cyberdefence includes measures \nfor repelling threats not just against individual per-\nsons or enterprises but also against the state and its \nsocial foundations. The German armed forces view \nthemselves as the central instance for repelling exter-\nnal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-\nmany\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use \nand the German share of cyberspace are also part of \ncyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not \nonly that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out \nin cyberspace, but also that military deployments are \noccurring below the threshold of armed conflict and \nthat non-state actors are involved. The German Federal \nGovernment therefore explicitly points out that mili-\ntary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nGermany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \ndiligence. National measures intended to check and \nincrease the quality of the components and key tech-\nnologies in use should be based on the clarification \nand exchange of information within the EU, and \nbetween the EU and NATO.

Every \nyear, NATO Computer Incident Response Capability \n(NCIRC), which has also been entrusted with operative \nIT security and network surveillance, organises its \nthree-day Cyber Coalition.137 The NCIRC Coordination \nCentre is responsible for coordinating with member \nstates and partner organisations for this event, such \nas the EU, OSCE or International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU).

In Ger-\nmany, this concerns primarily Art 87a GG and Art 24 \npara 2 GG. If these preconditions are met, it is legally \npossible to take damaging (counter-)measures against \nan attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gather-\ning and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German \narmed forces can use their own capacities to protect \nthe whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this \nis Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the \narmed forces to repel and cope with a particularly \ngrave incident. However, each armed deployment of \nGerman military forces requires the assent of the Ger-\nman Parliament under a law known as the Parlaments-\nbeteiligungsgesetz.140 In developing a German cyber-\ndefence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early \non about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal \nprecondition of parliamentary approval that exists in \nGermany is a major asset that must not carelessly be \nsacrificed to technological progress. In this context, \nthere needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval \nafter the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal \nConstitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah deci-\nsion141 in the summer of 2015. This dealt with the pos-\nsibility of informing the German Parliament only in \nretrospect in cases where there is \u201cGefahrenverzug\u201d, \nmeaning looming danger. \nCivilian Response \nIn times of peace, due diligence in cyberdefence \nmeans pursuing primarily civilian approaches to the \npreventative and reactive protection of one\u2019s IT sys-\ntems and infrastructure. However, Germany is also \narming itself militarily for cyberspace.

To avoid a digital arms race,146 cyberdefence needs \nto focus above all on building resilient structures.147 \nHowever, improved defensive capacities are not \nenough. It is also essential to develop high-security IT \nin close collaboration with other EU states and allies, \nand to curb the worldwide \u201cblack market\u201d for vulner-\nabilities in IT systems, and especially zero-day mar-\nkets.148 \nHowever, even within the German armed forces \nthere are concerns that the new division (CIR) could \ndevelop in ways that are similar to the United States \nCyber Command (USCYBERCOM), which is not subject \nto any parliamentary oversight and works closely with \n \n143  Thomas Wiegold, \u201cCyber-Attacke auch f\u00fcr Deutschland \nein m\u00f6glicher Angriff nach dem V\u00f6lkerrecht\u201d, Augen geradeaus! \n(Blog), 12 October 2012, http://augengeradeaus.net/2012/10/ \ncyber-attacke-auch-fur-deutschland-ein-moglicher-angriff-nach-\ndem-volkerrecht/ (accessed 15 March 2016). \n144  Federal Ministry of Defence, Dienststellen der Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis, \nKommando Strategische Aufkl\u00e4rung, http://www.kommando. \nstreitkraeftebasis.de/portal/a/kdoskb/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSS\nzPy8xBz9CP3I5EyrpHK94uyk-OyUfL3s4kT9gmxHRQCRV4XQ/ \n(accessed 30 November 2015). \n145  Federal Ministry of Defence, \u201cTagesbefehl der Ministerin: \nBundeswehr wird im Cyber-Raum zukunftsf\u00e4hig\u201d (see note 45); \nBundesministerium der Verteidigung, \u201cVon der Leyen reformiert \nCyber-Strukturen\u201d (see note 132). \n146  Ronald Deibert, \u201cTracking the Emerging Arms Race in \nCyberspace\u201d, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 67, no. 1 (2011): 1\u20138. \n147  Federal Parliament, first committee of inquiry, Stenografisches \nProtokoll der 9.

There are concerns that the activities of the \nCIR cannot be reconciled with the traditional under-\nstanding of the \u201ccitizen in uniform\u201d. The manner in \nwhich the capabilities to be created are strategically \nand operationally integrated into the German armed \nforces will therefore be decisive. \nDeveloping International Norms \nDeveloping international norms is a central part of \nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy. Germany ex-\nports technological products worldwide and receives \nprimary products from almost all of the world\u2019s coun-\ntries. However, since adjusting to standards always has \nits costs, it is very much in Germany\u2019s interests wher-\never possible to turn its own standards into the inter-\nnational norm. For this, its international cyber policy \nacts in three areas. Its first goal is to reach agreements \nwith third parties on confidence and security-building \nmeasures. Its second aims is to conclude agreements \nthat set international standards for the approval of \nhardware and software and define norms for respon-\nsible conduct by states. Its third target is applying \ninternational law in cyberspace. \nEuropean Cooperation \nFor the cyberdefence policy to enforce due diligence \nin cyberspace, the EU needs to be placed in a position \nwhere it can engage more closely in developing inter-\nnational norms. In April 2015, the EU\u2019s High Repre-\nsentative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Fede-\nrica Mogherini, and the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert \nKoenders emphatically pointed out the necessity of \ntaking states up on their promise for their behaviour \nin cyberspace. Mogherini and Koenders believe that \ninsufficiently secured central infrastructure is a threat \nto national and international security.149 In this, they \nrepresent all 28 member states, which have agreed on \nthis line in cyberdiplomacy.150 \nHowever, constructive criticism on the global level \nis extremely difficult because there are such divergent \nviews throughout the world on various aspects of in-\nformation security.

As a European middle-size power, \nGermany will only be able to find this new focus in a \nperspective that is in keeping with its integration in \nEuropean Union, democratic values and firm commit-\nment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence \nnorm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nand global character of a good international cyber and \ncybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic \nfoundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security \npolicies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-\ngence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental \nidea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility \nfor threats that emanate from their territory and must \ndo everything in their power in cooperation with \nother EU states and allies to prevent damage to third \nparties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-\ntures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and \nbring together a great number of interested parties. \nIn digital industrial policy cooperation between state \nand private actors with the aim of pooling profession-\nal expertise is needed to give due diligence greater \nweight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence \nof civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for \nimproving Germany\u2019s International and European \ncyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly \nenforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal \nstandard and is not included as a binding regulation \nin bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final \nreport of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, \nthe represented states commit to stopping attacks that \nemanate from their territories and also commit to not \ndeliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-\nstructure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-\ncrime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a \npromising step that can serve as a model for bilateral \nagreements between other countries. Here, it will be \nimportant to work politically towards a general recog-\nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary \ninstitutional structures in the medium term to guar-\nantee that the norm is being applied effectively. The \nGerman Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role \nin coordinating an international cyber policy and \ncyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only depart-\nment that rises above the sectional perspectives of \nindividual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial re-\nsponsibility. \nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy should be formulated even more strong-\nly inside EU structures. Only because of the European \nsingle market is Germany able to act with the neces-\nsary vigour on the international stage. A promising \nstarting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group \n(FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support \nthe implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-\nzontally at the EU level. While the working group has \nso far only been set up for three years at a time, it has \nalready become the most important hub for coordi-\nnating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU \nand USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-\nnational norms. Where they agree, they have enough \npolitical influence to tilt the scales towards a more \neffective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently \nneeded now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-\ntion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally \nattributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently \nuse this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by \nshifting the blame onto third parties. In line with \nthe TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer \nand a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance \nneed to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-\ntion Regulation should quickly be complemented by \nPrivacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets \nthe legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-\ntion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account \nthe legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision \nof October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-\npanies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU \nhas defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data \nbeing stored and evaluated according to US law.

With this decision, the EU will applys its own \nlaw on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial \neffects of national law contradict the principle of due \ndiligence obligations. States such as the US and China \nare likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-\ning legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This \ncould result in a collision course for different national \nlegal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-\ntion of the global economic space and the Internet. \nThe Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-\ntic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are \ntherefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed \non those states which have been attacked, on whose \nterritory the servers are located, or over whose data \ncables attacks are carried out. The density of these \nobligations should depend on the ability of the states \nin questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-\nities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-\ntive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, \nIT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point. This would also reduce legal un-\ncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must \nbe possible to force companies to make their software \nproducts more secure. At the very least, the criteria for \ntransparency, testing and certification must be made \nmore stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA. \nFourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected \nweapons systems and the high quality that detected \ncyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity \nknow-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to \ntake data security into account at the design stage of \nany system architecture. It therefore stands to reason \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further \ndevelopment and use of cyberdefence systems. How-\never, this should be coordinated at the European level, \napproved by politically independent or parliamentary \ndecisions, and remain committed to an exclusively \ndefensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct \nwould run counter to due diligence and would also \nbreak with the tradition of military restraint in for-\neign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in \nall issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-\nrity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-\nment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as \npart of their cyberdefence, the political change of \ncourse that might be required for this would need to \nbe debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-\nsupposes social resilience, which can only be created \nthrough public debate. This also includes carrying out \na reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-\nment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. \nIt will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-\ntures for parliamentary oversight. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

To create and preserve the Internet as a \npublic good, concerted global action is needed on the \nbasis of a common norm, which makes states mutu-\nally responsible for their diligence in national regula-\ntory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in \nthe German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as \nthe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides \nfor civil, police and military-defensive approaches to \nprotecting information-technology (IT) systems and \ninfrastructure. \nIn the course of the discussion about a new German \ncybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn \nof this year, a growing number of political voices have \nalso argued that political regulation and digital sover-\neignty should be strengthened and renationalised.

The political \nrules adopted for an international cyber policy and \ncybersecurity policy will always lag behind techno-\nlogical developments. It is the more important, there-\nfore, that new regulations be subordinated to an over-\narching norm. Three crucial political requirements \narise from this: \n\uf034 European cooperation: integrating national policies \ninto the European framework; \n\uf034 Inclusiveness: giving different interest groups broad \nand publicly accessible representation in formulat-\ning policies; \n\uf034 Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-\nponent over the military component, particularly \nin times of peace. \n \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states \nbehave responsibly not only towards one another, but \nalso in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. \nThe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided \nfor this. As part of implementing the EU directive on \nnetwork and information security (NIS), all EU states \nmust introduce minimum standards and reporting \nrequirements for IT security, and operators of critical \ninfrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national \nregulations in civil law (data protection), commercial \nlaw (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-\nmestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-\nfil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, \nit will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned \nGlobal Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members \nlargely agree that states are responsible for their own \nbehaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation \namong Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as \nwell as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN \nGGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE \nnegotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-\ncrime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The \nminimum conditions for global cybersecurity are \nratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as \nwell as continuous confidence- and security-building \nmeasures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and \nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, \nwhich was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the \nInformation Society) follow-up process, showed that a \nworldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term. Therefore, \nthe decision taken in December 2015 to continue the \nInternet Governance Forum \u2013 in other words, to keep \npursuing the multi-stakeholder approach \u2013 still offers \nthe best chance of preventing the idea of a global free \nand open Internet from falling victim to governments\u2019 \nintensifying security considerations. In Internet Gov-\nernance, it is therefore crucial to support the multi-\nstakeholder approach (interpreted inclusively) and to \nreject the principle of intergovernmental decision-\nmaking. The experience of the WSIS process of the past \nten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of inter-\ngovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-\ning on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \noperators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-\nerly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-\ngy to protect the economy and industry against espio-\nnage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-\nbilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense \nindicates that it wants to build additional defensive \ncapabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not \nbe advisable for the government to evolve towards \nan offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in \nopen contradiction with the idea of due diligence \nin cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the \nrisk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber \nattacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-\ncult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause \nserious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on \nthe German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is \nto persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring \na given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse \nto NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against \nIslamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last \nresorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to \nprop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-\nrity technology, for developing digital forensics, and \nfor extensive further-training measures to heighten \nawareness among civil servants, scientists, academics \nand researchers. Confidence-building measures within \nthe OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under \nthe leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-\nsified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving \nbilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-\ning and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and \nremove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of \nthis is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ning cybercrime. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Or \nmore simply, due diligence refers to your activities \nto identify and understand the risks facing your \norganization. Such due diligence obligations may \nexist between states, between non-state actors (e.g., \nprivate corporations), and between state and non-\nstate actors.

Cyberspace is based \non the universal and publicly accessible connection and trans-\nport network of the Internet, which can be complemented and \nexpanded at will by other data networks. IT systems functioning \nincluding all Internet stakeholders5 \u2013 agrees on com-\nmon norms of conduct and accepts rules that make \nthese norms binding.

According \nto the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-\ntories, and especially the computersystems and infra-\nstructure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 \ncontrol, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-\nture of other states.13 \nDue diligence is usually translated in international \nlaw treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-\npflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions \non one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful \nto use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The \nprinciple of due diligence derives its particular norma-\ntive force from the idea that states are not only respon-\nsible for keeping law and order on their own territories, \nbut also bear responsibility for the external consequences of \n \n10  International Court of Justice, \u201cCase Concerning Pulp Mills \non the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Decisions taken by individual states \nincreasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-\nritory. That is why states must exercise care with such \ndecisions and be accountable to one another for them. \nAs far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply \nlimit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. \nThis study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-\nnet needs to the political will by all stakeholders for \ninternational cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in \ncooperation with other states are obliged to do every-\nthing that may be reasonably expected of them to \nhelp deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \nThis expectation encompasses decision-making \nprocesses that meet high standards. This means that \navailable competences should be integrated as far as \npossible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics \nshould be avoided.16 In other words, an international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due \ndiligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode \nof regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy \nand cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated \nat the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated \ninto inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17 \n\uf034 Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \nwith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\nness as well as transparency.

Especially in \ntimes of crisis, the so-called rallying effect is an \nindispensable element of democratic resilience.\u201d19 \nHowever, the inclusiveness of legislative processes \nshould stop wherever private-sector actors start \nexerting a dominant influence on legislative bod-\nies.20 This can only be countered with transparent \nand representative processes that also give other \nstates a minimum of certainty that their legitimate \ninterests are being taken into consideration. The \nopenness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-\nmental prerequisite for states trusting one another \nso that they can deliver their individual contribu-\ntions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure \ncyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy \nto meet. In a technically challenging area such as \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, \nconsultations often need to be confidential. Fur-\nthermore, the expertise of large companies almost \ninevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-\ndinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or \nmembers of parliament to be accepted as compe-\ntent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore \nrequired to prevent one-sided representations of \ninterests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \nindustry.21 \nA maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign \npolicy states that regulatory practices should be co-\nordinated as closely as possible with its most impor-\ntant European partners.22 The internal market is so \ntightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 \nas indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that \nindividual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are \n \n19  Christopher Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolg-\nreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d, lecture given at \nthe CyberLab of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of \nexceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting \nof the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-\nnated in entire passages of text from trade-association position \npapers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative \nact.

German \nmeasures to promote a free and secure Internet \nshould therefore always be integrated at the Euro-\npean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously \nclaim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-\ntiating power on the global stage if it coordinates \nintensively with the leading European cybernations \n(France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, \nSpain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such \nas the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber \nIssues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-\nordinated at the European level can prevent global-\nisation and digitalisation from aggravating the \nsymptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany \nthat the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-\nspace24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-\nfies that states should not merely orientate themselves \nalong national interests, but also think in the catego-\nries of global public good. Germany\u2019s tradition of \ncivilian power25 is perpetuated in its international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy as well. \n\uf034 The German Federal Republic has always held to \nthe principle of generally pursuing its interests \nthrough economic and political rather than mili-\ntary means. In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy is one that tries to civilise inter-\nnational policy in cyberspace. That would mean \ninternationalising socially accepted norms as much \nas possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n \n23  The FoP Cyber was created in 2013 for a three-year period as \na permanent body to monitor the implementation of Europe\u2019s \ncyberstrategy.

With their \nnew IT-security law and the NIS (Network and Infor-\nmation Security) directive, Germany and the EU \nare leading by example in creating resilient infor-\nmation and communications structures in critical \ninfrastructure and in setting minimum standards \nin IT security. Research into resilience, prevention, \npeace and conflict has a key role to play in cyber-\nsecurity when it comes to civilising politics. \nIn due diligence, material and procedural contents \nmerge into an overarching norm. For the purposes of \n \n26  Offensive strategies aim at \u201cattacking the systems of other \nstates, sabotaging them, gaining control over them, rendering \nthem inoperative or causing malfunctioning\u201d. But it is a matter \nof \u201csecuring and sustaining one\u2019s own IT structures and com-\nmunications and weapons systems, and protecting them against \nbeing influenced or attacked, by using so-called defensive \napproaches.\u201d German Parliament, Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten \nDr. Alexander Neu u.a.: Krieg im \u201cCyber-Raum\u201d \u2013 offensive und defensive \nCyberstrategie des Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung, Drucksache \n18/6496 (Berlin, 16 October 2015).

The responsible authorities are now closely \ninterconnected. However, it is also clear that much \nstill needs to be improved with a view to European \ncooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response. \nInstitutional Structures \nThe German Federal Government has committed to \ncreating a complete instrumentarium in coordination \nwith the responsible state authorities to defend against \ncyber attacks.31 This is intended to contribute to guar-\nanteeing security provisions for the state as a whole. \nThe development of fully differentiated responsibili-\nties is politically willed.32 Germany\u2019s international \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy contains a whole \nseries of cooperations, which essentially rest on five \npillars. \nFirst Pillar: The Federal Office for Information Security \nIn Germany, overall ministerial control over cyber-\nsecurity issues rests with the German Federal Ministry \nof the Interior (BMI).33 The Federal Office for Informa-\ntion Security (BSI) is the Federal Government\u2019s most \nimportant service provider in IT security.

The Centre is also part of the \nstate\u2019s project-based collaboration with companies \nand service providers, and with foreign security ser-\nvices. The separation rule is a fundamental tenet of \nGerman federal legislation and stipulates that the \ntasks of the police and the intelligence services must \nbe carried out by different, organisationally distinct \nauthorities. Counter-intelligence is the purview of the \nBfV while the BKA is responsible for policing criminally \nmotivated IT attacks. The technical information depart-\nment (TA) of the Federal Intelligence Services (BND) \nretrieves information by technical means (Signals In-\ntelligence or SIGINT); it obtains, in accordance with \nits official mandate, information that is significant for \nGermany\u2019s foreign and security policy; and it evalu-\nates it.38 Using this information, the BND also sup-\nports the German armed forces in their cyberdefence. \nThird Pillar: The National Cybersecurity Council \nWhen dealing with the challenges of cybersecurity, \nstrong coordination with the state as a whole must be \nensured.39 To this end, the interministerial National \nCybersecurity Council, chaired by the Federal Com-\nmissioner for Information Technology, brings together \nthe secretaries of state.40 Furthermore, in Germany, IT \nsecurity is a federal issue. The Cybersecurity Council \nconsists of two federal-state representatives, repre-\n \n(BBK), domestic intelligence service (BfV), German Intelligence \nServices (BND), Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Customs \nInvestigation Bureau (ZKA), Federal Police (BPol) and Armed \nForces.

In 2011, the Minis-\ntry of Foreign Affairs created its coordination staff for \ninternational cyber policy.42 This staff serves as the \ninterface between national ministerial policies on the \none hand and the effort to coordinate the internation-\nal exertion of influence on the other hand, with the \naim of creating a climate of security and trust, such as \nis indispensable for a defensive cybersecurity strategy. \nFifth Pillar: The German Armed Forces \nMeasures taken by the German military should be lim-\nited to protecting their own capacity to act in accord-\nance with their mandate, \u201cso as to embed cybersecurity \nas a part of the security provisions for the state as a \nwhole\u201d.43 This is the responsibility of the German mili-\n \n41  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie \nf\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \n42  Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cyber-Au\u00dfenpolitik, http:// \nwww.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/GlobaleFragen/ \nCyber-Aussenpolitik/KS_Cyber-Aussenpolitik_node.html (ac-\ncessed 5 February 2016). \n43  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie \nf\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In September \n2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen \nconfirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for \ncyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-\ntry\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned \nfor specific military cyber operations. There are also \nplans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) \nan expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-\nment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose \na risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for \nduty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-\nnent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \n\u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence \nservice\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider \non security issues, and it advises and supports the \nGerman armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and \non foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main \nbodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity \nstrategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-\nligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-\nmittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-\ntee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-\nmittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics \nof the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace \nmakes no distinction between domestic and foreign \npolicy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy \nand the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means \nof attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-\nputer programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, \ndisrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications \nsystems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-\nmation from data sources that are not publicly available.

However, the im-\nplementation of the three major challenges to an \ninternational cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 \nnamely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-\nian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to \nestablish an overview of the cyber threat situation are \nunsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more \nsuccessful, proposals have been put forward to trans-\nform the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-\nbrella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint \nAnti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently \nbring together all federal and state authorities. There \nare also calls for more cooperation between national \nand EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, \nsuch as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany \nnot only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d \nfrequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part \nof the European coordination. Moreover, vital coordi-\nnation at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because \nthe attribution of specific responsibilities is so com-\nplicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, \ncoalition partners have been discussing whether Ger-\nmany needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital \nagency.50 However, they have only been able to agree \non an office without power or resources: the office \nof Digital Champion of the Federal Government, cur-\nrently held by Gesche Joost. \n \n49  Since 2011, the European External Action Service has been \nresponsible for the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), \nwhich produces civilian situation analyses for EU decision-\nmakers based on material delivered by national intelligence \nservices.

In part, these reforms have \nonly become public knowledge through leaked docu-\nments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-\ntional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February \n2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-\nbohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views \nhis links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times \nthe resources available for the offensive approach than \nthere are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks \nor compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a \nmember of the executive board of the Federal Associa-\ntion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-\ntions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only \none in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-\ncies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-\nnies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to \ncontact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather \nthan the police, since the latter would have to launch \na preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act \nwas suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-\ning the intelligence services as well as improving par-\nliamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55 \n \n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range \nlaunched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal \nnetzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason. However, the case was \ndropped after political intervention.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-\nj\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated \nfor regulating the exchange of information by intel-\nligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to \nbe created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-\nperson for the armed forces.56 \nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of \nthe Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised \nthat it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT \nsecurity, but that the BMI had overall control on issues \nof cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being \nquestioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. \nEven the National Cybersecurity Council has not been \nable to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient \ndistribution of resposibilities. In July 2013, while eluci-\ndating the NSA affair, the German Federal Govern-\nment did publish an eight-point programme on im-\nproving protection of the private sphere.57 However, \nthe Cybersecurity Council did not publicly take a \nposition on the questionable practices of the security \nservices \u2013 for instance, committing industrial espio-\nnage58 or keeping selector lists with spying targets.59 \n \n56  Rudi Wais, \u201cSo k\u00f6nnte eine bessere Kontrolle der Nachrich-\ntendienste aussehen\u201d, Augsburger Allgemeine, 3 May 2015, http:// \nwww.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/So-koennte-eine-bessere-\nKontrolle-der-Nachrichtendienste-aussehen-id33933952.html \n(accessed 30 November 2015). \n57  Federal Ministry of Defence/Federal Ministry of Industry \nand Technology, Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr einen besseren Schutz der Privat-\nsph\u00e4re, Fortschrittsbericht (Berlin, 14 August 2013), http:// \nwww.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Nachrichten/ \nPressemitteilungen/2013/08/bericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile. \n58  German Federal Parliament, Antwort der Bundesregierung auf die \nKleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Jan Korte, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Hahn, Ulla Jelpke, \nweiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

Many observers had expected a more \nproportionate reaction to the attack on Germany\u2019s \nhighest constitutional body. \nDigital Industrial Policy and the Importance \nof Private Actors \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional \nstructures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated \ncapabilities in information and communications tech-\nnology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 \nOver the past few decades, automisation has allowed \nthe German economy to respond well to the global \npressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal \nMinistry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost \nsmall and medium enterprises using its Digital Strat-\negy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily im-\nportant role in the Federal Government\u2019s international \ncybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in stra-\ntegic importance. The companies located there not \nonly create jobs and added value, but also set com-\npetitivity standards for whole economies.61 The Ger-\nman Federal Government believes that there is still \nplenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: \naccording to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for \nSystems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Net-\nworks could generate overall benefits to German \nsociety worth 56 million euros a year.62 \nHowever, other countries have digitalised more \nsuccessfully. The pioneering companies are mostly \nAmerican, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the \nGerman Federal Government launched the pro-\ngrammes Digital Agenda and Digital Management. \nHowever, these programmes are meagrely equipped \n \nJelpke, weiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal fund-\ning to the tune of around 200 million euros from the \nBMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to \nmake them competitive. It must be remembered that, \nto meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated \ninto European harmonisation and needs to focus on a \ndefensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThere has been criticism from the academia that \n\u201cthe Industrie 4.0 discourse [is] often too technical \nand national\u201d,63 and that it needed to be more closely \ninterconnected at the EU level than hitherto, because \nwhere (critical) infrastructure was concerned, solu-\ntions for data security, operational safety and data \nprotection were not being brought together.64 This is \nalso reflected in the Federal Government\u2019s programme \nDigital Agenda 2014\u20132017. It outlines seven fields of \naction including the \u201cEuropean and international \ndimension\u201d.65 According to the CDU, CSU and SPD \ncoalition agreement, a \u201cEuropean space of trust\u201d is \nsupposed to be created,66 but primarily with the help \nof national \u201cmeasures to regain technological sover-\neignty\u201d.67 It is not communicated by the government \nhow this obvious contradiction could be resolved.

Their special focus is first \nand foremost the German industrial policy. However, \nIndustrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only \nbe designed at the European or even global level.68 \nIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a \nstrategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this \nmarket, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros \nto EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the \nCommission currently has only limited means avail-\nable for developing key digital technologies. The Con-\nnecting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for \nresearch for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the \nJuncker Commission took up its posts in November \n2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the \nhelp of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-\nmission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the \nmarket, as well as distributive policies should be got \noff the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the \nnecessary speed is a problem, however, because the \nCommission first has to harmonise the legal policies \nof all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions \npublished by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in \n2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a \nEuropean or transatlantic agreement on data-security \nand data protection policy.Important decisions in this \ncontext are those on the illegality of telecommunica-\ntions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and \non the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, \nIndustrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und \nforschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente \nVernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache \n18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nSch\u00f6ssler and Ben Scott, eds., Kompendium Industrie 4.0.

The direc-\ntive is intended to make IT more secure for operators \nof critical infrastructure and large online service pro-\nviders, and will oblige affected companies to report \nany security and data protection events or IT attacks. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-\nnet. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-\ntration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, \nbut not social networks. Small digital companies are \nalso excluded. According to the directive, member \nstates will have to build national reporting systems \nand exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-\ntent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific \nComputer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) \nin addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-\nvolved. The German Federal Government used the \nlong negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a \nsolution nationally with its industry, before the EU \nagreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed \nits IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced \nreporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and \nminimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-\nture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-\nties and private companies working in the area of \ncritical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It \nis especially questionable whether the private sector \ncan self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to \nbecome dependent on the interests of individual pri-\nvate actors to the point where they are barely able to \nact meaningfully without them.77 This dependency \nbecomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these \ncompanies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO \nhave so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy \nin these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-\nvidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great \nBritain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on \ndeterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-\nveillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-\nsions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-\npretations could potentially result from this, since \ntechnical, political and legal reasons make it almost \nimpossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, \ncyberinsecurity is growing within the international \ncommunity. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-\ntect their citizens and data; and at the same time they \nhave to regulate the digital sector, which is largely \ndominated by private companies. Creating universally \nsecure components is considered extremely difficult, \nbut where software is used by the state, transparency, \ntesting and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce \nfrom this state of affairs which are the most important \nareas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-\nrights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, \nfighting cybercrime; and developing international \nnorms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and \nin terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise \nfrom this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-\nsibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in \nthe policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-\nes in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence \nmeans taking to heart the three demands of European \ncooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85 \nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-\nral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and \nsecurity policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness. The examples \nlisted only serve to illustrate the requirements named, which each \npolicy would have to meet according to due diligence principles. \n86  Ben Wagner, \u201cFreedom of Expression on the Internet: Implica-\ntions for Foreign Policy\u201d, Global Information Society Watch (2011): 20\u201322. \nvery latest since the revelations made by the former \nNSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even \nwestern secret services carry out passive surveillance \non a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly \ninfiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organi-\nsations such as Freedom House with its annual study \nFreedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or \nactivists for free software remind us again and again \nthat governments and globally active IT corporations \ndo not provide continual barrier-free Internet access \nacross the world.

One com-\nmentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the \nlaw\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between \ncivil liberties and security measures during states of \nemergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-\nporteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to \nprivacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the \nlong term, integrated economic areas also need inte-\ngrated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty \ngives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-\ndom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-\nened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was \nlegally binding on the EU and came into force at the \nsame time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-\ngation on the EU to ratify the European Convention \nfor the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental \nFreedoms. What holds true for the single market also \nholds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where \nthe transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU \nand USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy \nShield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic \nagreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, \nwhich might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-\nvant data and information. Intensive cooperation \namong law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed \nto fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-\nism, such as digital financial services providers, can \nonly be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely \non information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist \nFinance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-\nment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes \nand modernised mutual legal assistance agreements \n(MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive \ncooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n \n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche \nZeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and \nthe United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial \nMessaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the \nPurposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, \n27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-\ntive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nprehensive cooperation between the security services \n(as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, \nhowever, be subject to more stringent parliamentary \ncontrols. It is not in the interests of due diligence to \nhave secret services exchange their insights informally \nand, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for \ninstance those stipulated in agreements providing for \nmutual legal assistance.94 \nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human \nrights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to \nhave laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, \nat least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-\nmany and Europe, data protection is directly linked to \nthe right to informational self-determination whereby \ncitizens have a say in how their personal data may be \nused. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, \nbecause the state has a duty of protection towards its \ncitizens that it must fulfil. Technically speaking, data \nprotection and the state\u2019s protective duties associated \nwith it differ by area: international economic inter-\n \nName Record Data for the Prevention, Detection, Investigation and Pros-\necution of Terrorist Offences and Serious Crime, 14670/15 (Brussels, \n2 December 2015). \n93  This is the most significant secret-services cooperation in \nthe world, between the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia \nand New Zealand.

Specific arrangements are made in each \nof these areas because of the threat each poses to indi-\nvidual freedoms and security; these arrangements in \nturn have an impact on how inclusive the regulations \nare.95 \nData protection has become an area of law for \nwhich responsibility within the EU is divided. Legally \nbinding data protection provisions between states \nhave so far only been concluded at a regional level, \nnamely in 1981 in the shape of the European Council\u2019s \nconvention on data protection. \nThe trialogue between representatives of the Com-\nmission, the European Parliament and the Council of \nthe European Union led to an agreement in December \n2015 on a package of reforms for data protection in \nthe shape of the General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR96), which replaced the EU\u2019s data protection \ndirective of 1995. The new Regulation will have to be \ntransposed directly into national law as of 2018. The \nGDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-\nlates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data \nprocessing by the police and judicial authorities of the \nEU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-\non of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other \nuses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-\nknown examples of this practice are the large digital-\nservice providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-\nbook, which store the data of European clients in the \nUS using data protection provisions that violate Euro-\npean law. Where there are grave violations of the data \n \n95  Alongside the relevant paragraphs in Germany\u2019s Basic Law, \nthe legal bases can be found in the primary legislation on the \nsecurity services, police and other authorities: Bundesdaten-\nschutzgesetz (BDSG), Telekommunikationsgesetz (TKG), Gesetz \nzur Beschr\u00e4nkung des Brief-, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses \n(Artikel 10-Gesetz \u2013 G10), Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundeskriminalamt \n(BKAG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung des Bundesamtes f\u00fcr Sicher-\nheit in der Informationstechnik (BSIG), Gesetz \u00fcber das Zoll-\nkriminalamt und die Zollfahndungs\u00e4mter (Zollfahndungs-\ndienstgesetz \u2013 ZFdG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Bundesnachrichtendienst \n(BND-Gesetz \u2013 BNDG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Zusammenarbeit des Bun-\ndes und der L\u00e4nder in Angelegenheiten des Verfassungsschutzes \nund \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (Bundesverfas-\nsungsschutzgesetz \u2013 BVerfSchG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Milit\u00e4rischen \nAbschirmdienst (MAD-Gesetz \u2013 MADG), Verordnung \u00fcber die \n\u00dcbermittlung von Ausk\u00fcnften an die Nachrichtendienste des \nBundes (Nachrichtendienste-\u00dcbermittlungsverordnung \u2013 ND\u00dcV). \n96  Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Regulation of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals \nwith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement \nof such data (General Data Protection Regulation), document 5455/16 \n(Brussels, 28 January 2016). \nprotection law, data protection authorities will in \nfuture be able to impose drastic fines on companies. \nSuch authorities are playing an ever more important \nrole as instances for complaints and control because \nthey verify how personal data are handled and can \ninitiate sanctions.97 Their independence therefore \nneeds to be reinforced and the influence of private-\nsector companies on them needs to be restricted. The \nECJ has clarified in two decisions (2010 and 2012) that \ndata protection officials and their agencies must enjoy \n\u201ccomplete independence\u201d.98 \nCivilian Response \nThe data required to launch a criminal prosecution \nare not only generated through IT methods in the \nrespective country. Any EU member state launching a \nprosecution will also always access data sources that \nwere generated in allied states under different legal \ncircumstances and do not meet the strict German or \nEuropean requirements for data protection. While \nincreased retention of data is viewed as an important \ninstrument in fighting cybercrime, it has been inad-\nmissible to inform on or survey transmission data \ngenerated in the past since the German Federal Court\u2019s \ndecision of 2 March 2010. On 8 April 2014, the ECJ also \nquashed the EU directive on data retention, arguing \nthat it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fun-\ndamental Rights. A draft law presented by Federal \nJustice Minister Heiko Maas in 2015 intends to store \nthe telecommunications data of all German citizens \nfor 10 weeks.99 Technically, the instrument is already \nalmost outdated. \n \n97  The federal commissioner for data protection and freedom \nof information is expected to control the data protection efforts \nof telecommunications and postal services providers, federal \nagencies and other public federal offices.

The location of each server therefore has little \nimpact on the security or privacy of communications. \nEstablished certification standards are much more im-\nportant. Users can encrypt emails, establish single-use \nemail adresses115 or rely on De-mail.116 Nevertheless, \nstates are claiming the right to access encrypted com-\nmunications in criminal prosecutions and therefore to \nbuild \u201cbackdoors\u201d117 into the systems of suspects. Even \nwell-encrypted emails generate metadata, which yield \na lot of information about their sender, receiver, sub-\njects and time. Security services such as the NSA col-\nlect such data on a grand scale. Much work is being \ncarried out on encryption technologies to make this \ntask more difficult.118 Users themselves play a decisive \nrole in civilising communications. They can exert \npressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated \nand fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes \nsense for the Internet Governance committees to dis-\ncuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It \nwould be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet \nGovernance or to allow states to exert increasing \ninfluence over it, with the exception of state bodies \nwanting to comply with due diligence. Fundamental-\nly, however, Internet Governance remains in the \nhands of private actors for the time being. \n \n115  Provisional email addresses are also offered under the \nnames of disposable email or instant email. They are intended \nas much as possible to limit the loss of personal data when a loss \nof integrity, meaning a falsification of information, occurs with \nwebsite operators. \n116  The Federal Government implemented the European direc-\ntive 2006/123/EC on service provisions in the internal market via \nthe De-Mail (De-Mail-G, 28 April 2011). Using De-mail, messages \nand documents can be sent and received confidentially, securely \nand verifiably. De-mail is offered by various e-mail providers in \nGermany and can be used, among other things, for digital cor-\nrespondence with many ministries. E-Mail made in Germany.

First and foremost, this concerns \ncritical infrastructure and personal civil rights (and \nliberties). Since the 9/11 attacks, the UN has passed a \ngreat number of resolutions in the fight against terror-\nism that could serve as points of departure for cyber-\nsecurity as well. \nGermany has ratified the Council of Europe\u2019s Buda-\npest Convention on Cybercrime119 and backs the EU\u2019s \ncybersecurity strategy of February 2013.120 which uses \nthe same approach as Germany, namely a cybersecu-\nrity policy that is defensive and police-based in orien-\ntation. So far, the EU has limited itself to coordinating \nthe effort to create \u201can open, secure and protected \ncyberspace\u201d by focusing on a) creating resilient IT \nstructures, b) fighting cybercrime, c) developing defen-\nsive cybercapacities, d) promoting industrial and tech-\nnological developments in cybersecurity, and e) devel-\noping international cyberdiplomacy.121 The success \nand prospects of Europe\u2019s internal security depend on \nit acting at the national, European and international \nlevels whilst making use of the technological possibil-\nities of information exchange between these levels \nand giving that exchange legal protection. The glob-\nalisation, automation and industrialisation of crime \nrequire international and European coordination, \nespecially structural information exchanges between \nthe prosecuting authorities.122 \nEuropean Coordination \nTo enforce due diligence in the fight against cyber-\ncrime, substantive criminal law must urgently be \nharmonised, above all the definition of a criminal \noffence. Most EU member states have signed the Buda-\npest Convention and thus committed themselves to \nprosecuting offences occurring in cyberspace. How-\never, the legal conceptions of EU countries vary wildly \nwhen it comes to deciding which actions in cyberspace \n \n119  Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, CETS No. 185 \n(Budapest, 23 November 2001). \n120  European Commission, Cybersecurity Strategy of the European \nUnion: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN (2013) 1 final (Brus-\nsels, 7 February 2013). \n121  Ibid., 4f. \n122  \u201cDigitale Agenda\u201d, interview with Boris Pistorius, Minister \nof the Interior of Lower Saxony, Beh\u00f6rden Spiegel (February 2014). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-\nnal offences using intergovernmental agreements of \nindividual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed \nis a process that involves all EU states and orientates \nitself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-\nity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and \npolitical system still rests on criminal law applying \nand operating within national borders. At the same \ntime, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access \nrights because cloud services, for example, operate \nbeyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-\ncentrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while \napplying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are \na number of further meaningful initiatives, such as \nthe European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-\npean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual \nlegal assistance agreements, including all relevant \ntransatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies \nfrom relocating their business abroad and thus cir-\ncumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-\nsecurity standards (the NIS directive) should be brought \ninto line with those set in the US by the National Insti-\ntute of Standards. Transatlantic cooperation has an \nimportant role to play not only in public-private part-\nnerships, but also at the official level, for instance in \nthe EU-US working group on fighting cybercrime.123 \nInclusiveness \nSecurity agencies on the EU and national levels will \nhave to get used to the fact that the fight against \ncybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-\ntion of private actors. A clear separation between \nprivate and public sector can hardly be upheld in this \narea, because the companies that have been attacked \nare frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nresolving cyber attacks. Corporations like Microsoft \neven obtain court orders authorising so-called hack-\nbacks: authorising them, in other words, to penetrate \nthe attackers\u2019 IT systems in turn, for instance to \ndestroy groups of automated malware, so-called bot-\n \n123  Annegret Bendiek, Umstrittene Partnerschaft.

Where such a hunt is successful, \nattackers may be prevented from accessing the most \nsensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is \nstored in such a way that it can be used in court. \nGathering evidence from large and complex data \nbanks takes time and requires extremely powerful \ncomputers. Digital forensics face enormous challeng-\nes. That is why authorities bank on support from \nprivate IT forensic scientists to solve crimes.

The Global Player \nInitiative is a network founded back in 2006, in which \nthe BKA and (currently) 62 large enterprises partici-\npate. Overall, the BKA cooperates with about 630 \ncompanies. Frequently, this exchange of information is \nstill more of a one-way street, because small and \nmedium enterprises in particular do not have the \ncapacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \nIn Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are \nobliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \nminimum security standards for their IT. However, \nsecurity issues concerning software products and \nexternal cloud services have not yet been sufficiently \nresolved.

According to the strategy the relevant \nagencies need to be given more supranational com-\npetences and more funds. These include Europol\u2019s \nEuropean Cybercrime Centre (EC3)128; the European \nNetwork and Information Security Agency (ENISA); \nand the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit \n(Eurojust). The cyberexercises that are regularly co-\nordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they \nare important for building resilient IT structures in \naccordance with due diligence. 29 EU-EFTA member \nstates and 200 governmental organisations participated \nin the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise.129 The exercise was \ndesigned to test how to improve cooperation between \nstates in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the \nwhole of Europe; how the many parallel communica-\ntions relations impact on generating an overview of \nthe national and European situation; and what con-\nsequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might \nhave for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. \nAt the operative level, the continuous cooperation of \nthe IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispen-\nsable. The BSI, for instance, is a member of the Euro-\npean Government CERTs Group (EGC), an informal \ngroup at the European level, and of the Forum for \nIncident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), an in-\nternational coalition of about 200 state and private \nCERTS.130 \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the \nCooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence \n(CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the \nAlliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of \nGerman academics, the Centre presented proposals \n \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. \neuropa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-\n1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA \nCE2014.

The German armed forces view \nthemselves as the central instance for repelling exter-\nnal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-\nmany\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use \nand the German share of cyberspace are also part of \ncyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not \nonly that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out \nin cyberspace, but also that military deployments are \noccurring below the threshold of armed conflict and \nthat non-state actors are involved. The German Federal \nGovernment therefore explicitly points out that mili-\ntary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nGermany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \ndiligence. National measures intended to check and \nincrease the quality of the components and key tech-\nnologies in use should be based on the clarification \nand exchange of information within the EU, and \nbetween the EU and NATO.

In Ger-\nmany, this concerns primarily Art 87a GG and Art 24 \npara 2 GG. If these preconditions are met, it is legally \npossible to take damaging (counter-)measures against \nan attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gather-\ning and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German \narmed forces can use their own capacities to protect \nthe whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this \nis Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the \narmed forces to repel and cope with a particularly \ngrave incident. However, each armed deployment of \nGerman military forces requires the assent of the Ger-\nman Parliament under a law known as the Parlaments-\nbeteiligungsgesetz.140 In developing a German cyber-\ndefence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early \non about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal \nprecondition of parliamentary approval that exists in \nGermany is a major asset that must not carelessly be \nsacrificed to technological progress. In this context, \nthere needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval \nafter the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal \nConstitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah deci-\nsion141 in the summer of 2015. This dealt with the pos-\nsibility of informing the German Parliament only in \nretrospect in cases where there is \u201cGefahrenverzug\u201d, \nmeaning looming danger. \nCivilian Response \nIn times of peace, due diligence in cyberdefence \nmeans pursuing primarily civilian approaches to the \npreventative and reactive protection of one\u2019s IT sys-\ntems and infrastructure.

Germany ex-\nports technological products worldwide and receives \nprimary products from almost all of the world\u2019s coun-\ntries. However, since adjusting to standards always has \nits costs, it is very much in Germany\u2019s interests wher-\never possible to turn its own standards into the inter-\nnational norm. For this, its international cyber policy \nacts in three areas. Its first goal is to reach agreements \nwith third parties on confidence and security-building \nmeasures. Its second aims is to conclude agreements \nthat set international standards for the approval of \nhardware and software and define norms for respon-\nsible conduct by states. Its third target is applying \ninternational law in cyberspace. \nEuropean Cooperation \nFor the cyberdefence policy to enforce due diligence \nin cyberspace, the EU needs to be placed in a position \nwhere it can engage more closely in developing inter-\nnational norms. In April 2015, the EU\u2019s High Repre-\nsentative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Fede-\nrica Mogherini, and the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert \nKoenders emphatically pointed out the necessity of \ntaking states up on their promise for their behaviour \nin cyberspace. Mogherini and Koenders believe that \ninsufficiently secured central infrastructure is a threat \nto national and international security.149 In this, they \nrepresent all 28 member states, which have agreed on \nthis line in cyberdiplomacy.150 \nHowever, constructive criticism on the global level \nis extremely difficult because there are such divergent \nviews throughout the world on various aspects of in-\nformation security.

However, the concrete application \nof international law to cyberspace remains a point of \ncontention. Selected EU states are engaging on the UN \nlevel and represent the EU.

A fifth round of GGE nego-\ntiations is scheduled to start in 2016. The EU states \ninvolved should focus their energies on giving EU con-\ncerns more emphasis in the GGE in future, as stipulated \nin the Council\u2019s conclusions on cyberdiplomacy.152 In \nthis, the EU needs to speak \u201cwith one voice\u201d, because \na divided EU would find it very difficult to assert its \ninterests over those of the US, Russia or China. \nInclusiveness \nIt is part of the tasks of the German and EU inter-\nnational cyber policy and cyberdefence policy to \nprevent a digital arms race by prioritising civilian \napproaches and confidence-building measures.

Since \nJune 2013, Germany has been a member of the Free-\ndom Online Coalition, a multi-stakeholder platform \nthat now comprises 28 countries and campaigns for \nliberties in cyberspace.155 Due diligence also applies \nto German companies in the information, communi-\ncations and Internet economy.

As a European middle-size power, \nGermany will only be able to find this new focus in a \nperspective that is in keeping with its integration in \nEuropean Union, democratic values and firm commit-\nment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence \nnorm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nand global character of a good international cyber and \ncybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic \nfoundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security \npolicies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-\ngence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental \nidea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility \nfor threats that emanate from their territory and must \ndo everything in their power in cooperation with \nother EU states and allies to prevent damage to third \nparties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-\ntures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and \nbring together a great number of interested parties. \nIn digital industrial policy cooperation between state \nand private actors with the aim of pooling profession-\nal expertise is needed to give due diligence greater \nweight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence \nof civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for \nimproving Germany\u2019s International and European \ncyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly \nenforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal \nstandard and is not included as a binding regulation \nin bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final \nreport of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, \nthe represented states commit to stopping attacks that \nemanate from their territories and also commit to not \ndeliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-\nstructure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-\ncrime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a \npromising step that can serve as a model for bilateral \nagreements between other countries. Here, it will be \nimportant to work politically towards a general recog-\nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary \ninstitutional structures in the medium term to guar-\nantee that the norm is being applied effectively. The \nGerman Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role \nin coordinating an international cyber policy and \ncyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only depart-\nment that rises above the sectional perspectives of \nindividual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial re-\nsponsibility. \nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-\nsecurity policy should be formulated even more strong-\nly inside EU structures. Only because of the European \nsingle market is Germany able to act with the neces-\nsary vigour on the international stage. A promising \nstarting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group \n(FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support \nthe implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-\nzontally at the EU level. While the working group has \nso far only been set up for three years at a time, it has \nalready become the most important hub for coordi-\nnating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU \nand USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-\nnational norms. Where they agree, they have enough \npolitical influence to tilt the scales towards a more \neffective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently \nneeded now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-\ntion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally \nattributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently \nuse this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by \nshifting the blame onto third parties. In line with \nthe TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer \nand a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance \nneed to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-\ntion Regulation should quickly be complemented by \nPrivacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets \nthe legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-\ntion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account \nthe legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision \nof October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-\npanies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU \nhas defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data \nbeing stored and evaluated according to US law.

With this decision, the EU will applys its own \nlaw on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial \neffects of national law contradict the principle of due \ndiligence obligations. States such as the US and China \nare likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-\ning legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This \ncould result in a collision course for different national \nlegal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-\ntion of the global economic space and the Internet. \nThe Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-\ntic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are \ntherefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed \non those states which have been attacked, on whose \nterritory the servers are located, or over whose data \ncables attacks are carried out. The density of these \nobligations should depend on the ability of the states \nin questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-\nities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-\ntive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, \nIT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point. This would also reduce legal un-\ncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must \nbe possible to force companies to make their software \nproducts more secure. At the very least, the criteria for \ntransparency, testing and certification must be made \nmore stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA. \nFourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected \nweapons systems and the high quality that detected \ncyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity \nknow-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to \ntake data security into account at the design stage of \nany system architecture. It therefore stands to reason \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further \ndevelopment and use of cyberdefence systems. How-\never, this should be coordinated at the European level, \napproved by politically independent or parliamentary \ndecisions, and remain committed to an exclusively \ndefensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct \nwould run counter to due diligence and would also \nbreak with the tradition of military restraint in for-\neign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in \nall issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-\nrity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-\nment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as \npart of their cyberdefence, the political change of \ncourse that might be required for this would need to \nbe debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-\nsupposes social resilience, which can only be created \nthrough public debate. This also includes carrying out \na reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-\nment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. \nIt will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-\ntures for parliamentary oversight. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace \nand con\ufb02\n ict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d\u200a4 Among these customary and \u201clong stand-\ning international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, \nthis principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal \nacts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or \ncontrol. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as \nit was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space \nwas \ufb01\n nite and obvious. How can this old wine \ufb01\n t into the new bottles of ubiquitous \nand dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of \nan armed attack?\nI will \ufb01\n rstly brie\ufb02\n y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law \n(2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns \nthe applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-\nevance in this \ufb01\n eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to \na series of speci\ufb01\n c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber \ndiligence\u201d obligation and the need to \ufb01\n nd a right balance between the obligation to \nprotect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to \nrespect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having \nthis in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation \nto enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against \nothers States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber \ninfrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react \nin relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-\nply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and \nduties of States, to more speci\ufb01\n c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in \ninternational environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in \ninternational human rights law.\n2. \nDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. \nAccording to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState.

Due diligence is \nan obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result.10 According to S. Heathcote, this \nmeans that States should \u201cdeploy their best efforts to achieve [the] desired outcome ... \neven if that outcome need not be ensured\u201d.11 However, the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d12 could \ngive the impression that we are in the borderline between a normative and a merely \npolitical obligation.13 It could thus be better to declare that States have the obligation \nto \u201cemploy all available means\u201d or \u201cto take all available measures\u201d, or to \u201cdo all that \ncould be reasonably expected of them\u201d.14\nAs the ICJ said in 2007 in the Genocide case:\n9 \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[t]his obligation applies not only to criminals acts \nharmful to others States, but also, for example, to activities that in\ufb02\n ict serious damage, \nor have the potential to in\ufb02\n ict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the ter-\nritorial sovereignty of the target State\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 26 para. 3.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to \nM. N. Schmitt and L.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv.

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take? The international pro-\ntection of human rights gives us some very interesting insights in this \ufb01\n eld, especially \nwith the development of the so-called \u201cpositive obligations\u201d.

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures?

The responsibility of States has often been engaged by \nhuman rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \nWe maybe \ufb01\n nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of \npositive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-\ngence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-\ntive, judicial and administrative measures in the \ufb01\n eld of human rights derives directly \nfrom the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-\ntion exist in the \ufb01\n eld of cyber diligence without a speci\ufb01\n c treaty?\n42 \nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant.

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human \nRights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be dif\ufb01\n cult to investigate acts that violate individual \n61 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 9.\n62 \nAs the Tallinn Manual states, \u201c[t]he nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The \ntest in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \nThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \nAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\nedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \nits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \nGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \n22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \nthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \nChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

How can this old wine \ufb01\n t into the new bottles of ubiquitous \nand dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of \nan armed attack?\nI will \ufb01\n rstly brie\ufb02\n y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law \n(2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns \nthe applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-\nevance in this \ufb01\n eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to \na series of speci\ufb01\n c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber \ndiligence\u201d obligation and the need to \ufb01\n nd a right balance between the obligation to \nprotect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to \nrespect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having \nthis in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation \nto enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against \nothers States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber \ninfrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react \nin relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-\nply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and \nduties of States, to more speci\ufb01\n c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in \ninternational environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in \ninternational human rights law.\n2. \nDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. \nAccording to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the terri-\n4 \nThe White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security and \nOpenness in a Networked World (Washington 2011), p. 9.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to \nM. N. Schmitt and L.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv. Iran), Judgment of 24 May 1980, ICJ Reports 1980, para. 68.\n20 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n21 \nOsman v. United Kingdom, supra note 14, para. 116. Accordingly, not every claimed risk \nto life can entail for the authorities a requirement to take operational measures to prevent \nthat risk from materialising. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take? The international pro-\ntection of human rights gives us some very interesting insights in this \ufb01\n eld, especially \nwith the development of the so-called \u201cpositive obligations\u201d.

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip \nfrom the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In \nthe \ufb01\n eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \n\u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d\u200a45 proclaimed \nby human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by \nhuman rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \nWe maybe \ufb01\n nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of \npositive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-\ngence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-\ntive, judicial and administrative measures in the \ufb01\n eld of human rights derives directly \nfrom the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-\ntion exist in the \ufb01\n eld of cyber diligence without a speci\ufb01\n c treaty?\n42 \nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-\ncies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or \npractice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-\nantees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31: The Nature of the General \nLegal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, \n26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \nSee for example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \n30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \nCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \nSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \nSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \nmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \n2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \nsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \n(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \n\u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n51 \nAlabama Claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, supra note 35, p. \n131.\n52 \nThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \nLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate.

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

Indeed, \nthis principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal \nacts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or \ncontrol. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as \nit was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space \nwas \ufb01\n nite and obvious. How can this old wine \ufb01\n t into the new bottles of ubiquitous \nand dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of \nan armed attack?\nI will \ufb01\n rstly brie\ufb02\n y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law \n(2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns \nthe applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-\nevance in this \ufb01\n eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4).

Having \nthis in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation \nto enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against \nothers States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber \ninfrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react \nin relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-\nply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and \nduties of States, to more speci\ufb01\n c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in \ninternational environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in \ninternational human rights law.\n2. \nDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. \nAccording to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to \nM. N. Schmitt and L.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv.

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v. United Kingdom, supra note 14, p. 116. See also ECtHR, Paul and Audrey \nEdwards v.

This effort should allow us to identify the \norigin of attacks, assess the offensive capabilities of potential adversaries and in this \nway counter their action.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take? The international pro-\ntection of human rights gives us some very interesting insights in this \ufb01\n eld, especially \nwith the development of the so-called \u201cpositive obligations\u201d.

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51. The Human Rights Committee also clearly recognises that \n[t]he legal obligation under article 2, paragraph 1 [of the ICCPR], is both negative and \npositive in nature. \u2026 There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant \nrights as required by article 2 would give rise to violations by States parties of those \nrights, as a result of States parties\u2019 permitting or failing to take appropriate measures or \nto exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by \nsuch acts by private persons or entities\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General Comment \nNo. 31: The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the \nCovenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, paras. 6, 8.\n40 \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Kili\u00e7 v.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip \nfrom the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In \nthe \ufb01\n eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \n\u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d\u200a45 proclaimed \nby human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by \nhuman rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \nWe maybe \ufb01\n nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of \npositive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-\ngence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-\ntive, judicial and administrative measures in the \ufb01\n eld of human rights derives directly \nfrom the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-\ntion exist in the \ufb01\n eld of cyber diligence without a speci\ufb01\n c treaty?\n42 \nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant.

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human \nRights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be dif\ufb01\n cult to investigate acts that violate individual \n61 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 9.\n62 \nAs the Tallinn Manual states, \u201c[t]he nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The \ntest in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \nThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \nAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\nedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \nits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \nGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \n22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \nthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \nChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state\ncontinues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of\nsovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire\nnational territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control\nits cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and conse-\nquently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect\nin the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive mea-\nsures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the\nseparatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.\nKeywords: international human rights law, due diligence, cyberspace, effective control, Ilas\u0327cu case\n1.

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed con\ufb02ict, the law of non-international armed\ncon\ufb02ict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4 it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be \ufb01lled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6 and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7 Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo\n(governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9 second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10 Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had dif\ufb01culties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these de\ufb01ciencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12 The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13 have identi\ufb01ed certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14 Speci\ufb01cally in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine\n2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights\nCannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe\nConvention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force\n1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force\n3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017,\npara 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017,\nExplanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership\nCountries, 3 May 2017, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/603897/EPRS_BRI(2017)\n603897_EN.pdf; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April\n2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the\nTemporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September\n2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Of\ufb01ce of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\n(UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN\nDoc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission\nof Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.\nReferences to media in the cited documents include a particular means of mass communication, that disseminated\nin cyberspace\n11 Section 2 in this article.\n12 Section 4 in this article.\n13 Charter of the United Nations (entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI.\n14 Sections 4 and 5 in this article.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n199\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16 and occupying states,17 the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18 and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19 \u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother. Section 3 con\ufb01rms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the ter-\nritorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the\ncyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights\narising from sovereignty.

The conclusions provide\nsome recommendations for enhancing human rights compliance of the territorial states concerned\nwithin the positive law framework of IHRL.\n2. CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE\nTERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21\nIt is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders\ncreating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22 and its innovative nature seems to provoke new\nproblems in law, especially in international law.\nThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be de\ufb01ned as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real\nspace, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 \ufb01rst\nof all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication\ntechnology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23\nIn other words, it is a \ufb01ctional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the\nphenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-\nmunications technology (ICT). It follows from the above de\ufb01nition that cyberspace has three\nlayers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network),\nand a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network\n(cyber-persona layer).24 Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical\narchitecture.25\n\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia,\ntelecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26 This article focuses on\nthose cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-\nnationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are\nmore relevant than others in the cyber context.

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online.

This double\ndif\ufb01culty of control, over the online and of\ufb02ine spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at \ufb01rst sight cyberspace hardly \ufb01ts within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64 also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65 A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by de\ufb01nition, trans-\nboundary character.66 However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67 Today it is widely recognised by states68 and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015),\nUN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-\nlar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019\n(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties\ngoverning cyberspace has increased.70\nThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a\nnovel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless\ntelegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-\ncations in their territory.71 Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-\ntrol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and\nthat a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference\nin the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through\nradio.72 To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the\nsame principles apply.73\nThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the\nsupreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74\neven though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75 The physical\nlayer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-\ntual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a speci\ufb01c state.76\nState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\n\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether\nby legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77 In other words, it is the competence of a state\nto regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the\nContext of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the \ufb01rst international treaty to\nregulate conduct in the cyberspace; Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the\nCriminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems (entered\ninto force 1 March 2006) ETS 189; United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in\nInternational Contracts (entered into force 1 March 2013) 2898 UNTS 1; League of Arab States, Arab\nConvention on Combating Information Technology Offences (entered into force February 2014), see the authentic\nArab text and the rati\ufb01cation status at http://www.lasportal.org/ar/legalnetwork/Pages/agreements_details.\naspx?RID=73 and the English translation at http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Arab_Convention_on_Combating_\nInformation_Technology_Offences; African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection\n(adopted 27 June 2014, not yet in force) (2017) 56 ILM 166.\n71 International Radiotelegraph Convention (London, 5 July 1912), (1913) 10 Treaty Series 139\u2013217, art 1;\nInternational Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (entered into force 2 April\n1938) 186 LNTS 301, art 1; Resolution on Radio-Telegraphic Communications (1927) Annuaire de l\u2019Institut\nde Droit International, session de Lausanne, 287 and 342\u201343, para 1.\n72 Vernon Van Dyke, \u2018The Responsibility of States for International Propaganda\u2019 (1940) 34 American Journal of\nInternational Law 58, 58\u201359; Hersch Lauterpacht, \u2018Revolutionary Propaganda by Governments\u2019 (1927) 13\nTransactions Grotius Society 143, 162; W Friedmann, \u2018The Growth of State Control over the Individual, and\nIts Effect upon the Rules of International State Responsibility\u2019 (1938) 19 British Year Book of International\nLaw 118, 146\u201347.\n73 Schmitt (n 27) 26, 284\u201385, 312\u201335.\n74 ibid 11 para 1.\n75 ibid 60\u201371 (Rules 10\u201311).\n76 Tsagourias (n 24) 21, 27.\n77 Bernard H Oxman, \u2018Jurisdiction of States\u2019 (2007) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law para 1.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n207\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan,\nGeorgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-\nereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside\ntheir effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpeci\ufb01cally in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-\nating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-\ntion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise\njurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\n\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-\nstantial effect in its territory\u2019.87 As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective\nrestatement of the lex lata and,88 as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction\nre\ufb02ects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\nThe \ufb01rst of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a\nperson or an object in the territory of the state provides a suf\ufb01cient basis for the exercise of juris-\ndiction by that state.89 Since information and communication technologies require some physical\ninfrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-\nities in their national territory.90\nFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-\nmunications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the\nstate.91 The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control\nis thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such\nas cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-\nities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s\nterritory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-\nment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity\ncompleted in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92 In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Therefore, the current tendency of state practice is to\ninterpret territorial jurisdiction broadly, where any substantial connection between the cyber\nactivity and state territory might serve as a suf\ufb01cient basis for jurisdiction.94\nRelated to an area outside the state\u2019s effective control, this type of jurisdiction might lead to\nvarious scenarios. Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-\npleted in the area concerned95 and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise\nits criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance.\nUnder \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-\nity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist\n\ufb01ghters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the\nviolation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even\nin another state.96\nThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-\ndictional link accepted to re\ufb02ect customary international law:97 where an activity does not emanate\nfrom or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain\ndomestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98 some scholars contest its applicability\nas it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-\nsites in all countries.99 The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-\nability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the\nstate and the cyber activity than is applied in the of\ufb02ine world.100 Accordingly, the territorial state will\nhave jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-\nfusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber\nactivities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information\nTechnology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur\nfor Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66.\n95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the of\ufb02ine context. Indeed, states101 and international organisations102 have\nrecognised that the rights that people have of\ufb02ine must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103 While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical of\ufb02ine space in that area\nmust be clari\ufb01ed.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104 Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 de\ufb01ned above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and\nDemocracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, https://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/\npdf_2011_05/20110926_110526-G8-Summit-Deauville.pdf; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global\nMulti-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet\nGovernance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/\nNETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace,\nProsperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, https://info.publicintelligence.net/\nWH-InternationalCyberspace.pdf.\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The\nPromotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/\n13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the\nInternet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015\n(n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet\nFreedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society,\nTunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation\nCM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet\nUsers, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights\nTreaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n211\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its\nauthority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or\nrebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the\nterritory of the State concerned\u2019.124 The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-\ncising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\nThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held\nthat it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain\neven where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to\ntake all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the\nwhole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set\nup, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby\ncease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-\nritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual\njurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-\nial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.\nCommentators note that it is a minimum rule of customary character: see Michal Gondek, \u2018Extraterritorial\nApplication of the European Convention on Human Rights: Territorial Focus in the Age of Globalization?\u2019\n(2005) 52 Netherlands International Law Review 349, 350.\n121 Assanidze (n 2) para 139.\n122 ibid para 140.\n123 ECtHR, Ilas\u0327cu and Others v Moldova and Russia, App no 48787/99, 8 July 2004.\n124 ibid para 312.\n125 ibid para 313.\n126 ibid para 333.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n214\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does\nnot affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131 including human rights\ntreaties.132 Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s\neffective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of\nits jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond con\ufb01rming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clari\ufb01ed the kind of\npositive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-\nive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and suf\ufb01cient\u2019 measures\nin order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective\ncontrol.133 The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state\nunder Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive\nobligations towards persons within its territory. The state in question must endeavour, with all the\nlegal and diplomatic means available to it vis-\u00e0-vis foreign states and international organisations, to\ncontinue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms de\ufb01ned in the Convention.\nIn the case of human rights violations committed by de facto authorities in the area, the ECtHR\nwill verify whether the territorial state has complied with a minimum threshold in the particular\ncircumstances \u2013 \u2018to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it\nshould have been made\u2019.135 The territorial state\u2019s positive obligations relate both to the measures\nneeded to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to\n127 ibid paras 20\u201321; Assanidze (n 2) para 140; ECtHR, Sargsyan v Azerbaijan, App no 40167/06, Admissibility,\n14 December 2011, paras 64\u201365.\n128 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49).\n129 Reservations and Declarations for Treaty (n 50).\n130 ECHR (n 29) art 56.\n131 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 39.\n132 ibid art 15(1).\n133 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 334.\n134 ibid para 333.\n135 Ibid para 334.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n215\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations\nin IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state\nhaving lost its territorial control, as it guarantees \ufb02exibility in assessing its particular situation.\nThe state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-\ntive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it\nknew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154 The \ufb01rst condition \u2013 known also as\nthe \u2018capacity to in\ufb02uence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155 \u2013 assesses the actual means\nin the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human\nrights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty,\nstill depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations.\nAccordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective\npower in the particular situation. According to the second condition, the state is responsible\nonly if the human rights violation actually occurred and if the state was aware of, or should\n146 Catan (n 136) para 147; ECtHR Vardanean v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 22200/10, 30 May\n2017, para 42.\n147 Ivan\u0163oc (n 143) para 109; Vardanean, ibid para 42.\n148 Island of Palmas Case (n 80) 839.\n149 Trail Smelter Case (US, Canada) (1938, 1941) III UNRIAA 1965; in the same sense Corfu Channel Case (UK\nv Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\n150 Corfu Channel case, ibid 18.\n151 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay) (Merits) [2010] ICJ Rep 14, 55\u201356 [101].\n152 Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22; Timo Koivurova, \u2018Due Diligence\u2019, (2010) MPEPIL, para 2.\n153 Case of Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Merits) (1988) Inter-Am CtHR, Judgment of 29 July 1988, (Ser C)\nNo 4, [172].\n154 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and\nHerzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, [430]\u2013[431].\n155 ibid [430].\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n217\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, UN Charter-based human rights bodies157 and universal treaty monitoring bod-\nies158 have reiterated the same standard and addressed various positive obligations with regard to\nindividuals in areas outside government control in their concluding observations on territorial\nstates.159 While the ECtHR has based this case law on the necessity to cover the European\n\u2018legal space\u2019 by the effective application of the ECHR160 and to eliminate \u2018vacuums\u2019 at the\nregional level,161 UN treaty monitoring bodies seek to ensure the universality of human rights\nwith the same practice.

It\nequally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-\ngation to protect167 and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes\nof international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of\nthe Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168 However, given the almost universal\nrati\ufb01cation of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide rati\ufb01cation of regional human\nrights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the\nnext section, due diligence and the speci\ufb01c positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely,\nwithin the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-\nside its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-\nnational law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169 This sug-\ngests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative\nframework.170 Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-\nties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state\nin IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have\nrecognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law\n(Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-\nviders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171\nHowever, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-\ntrol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace,\nit appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the\nonline context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-\ntioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has\ncomplied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed\nto re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and\nPrivate Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, https://papers.\nssrn.com/abstract=2941988; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden\nJournal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37,\npara 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression\n(12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n219\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Before exam-\nining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the\nfocus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-\ntions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights\nmonitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the\nterritorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s\nobligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-\ntions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to\nlife of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment\nthrough online means,173 and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to\nracial hatred174 or to terrorism.175 In this regard, there is no difference between government-\ncontrolled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial\nstate in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or \ufb01ltering commu-\nnications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176 A \ufb01rst possible legal\nbasis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of\nemergency.

MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-\nsures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere\nexpression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188 irrespective of the inef-\nfectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the\nterritorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189 Such measures could be\nconsidered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190 or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to\nre-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191\nWhile it is indeed dif\ufb01cult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals\nrather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter\nstandard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192 would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-\nment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193 and to reassert its\nresponsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and\ninternationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-\nmatic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to\nnormalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194 The measures to re-establish\ncontrol over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending\naccess to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14,\n12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\nI-11959,\n[47]\u2013[54];\nHuman\nRights\nCommittee,\nConcluding\nObservations:\nIslamic\nRepublic\nof\nIran\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding\nObservations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Del\ufb01AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Re\ufb02ections on\nEvolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143.\n191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67\nInternational and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Of\ufb01ce 1906)\n962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n222\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197 the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198 cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199 or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200 are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate. However, it is problematic if the state restricts internet/telecommu-\nnications for an extended period in order to re-assert control over its territory, while the same\nmeasures violate individuals\u2019 human rights and thus run against the third type of obligation\n(below). For instance, in the context of the Iraqi \ufb01ght against online propaganda and terrorist\nrecruitment by ISIL, the Iraqi government ordered internet service providers to shut down the\ninternet in the \ufb01ve provinces under ISIL control in June 2014.201 In fact, the measures aimed\nto re-establish control over territory/cyberspace should be taken within the limits de\ufb01ned by inter-\nnational law202 in general, and IHRL in particular.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234 The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to in\ufb02uence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235 In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed con\ufb02ict with grave\nhuman rights violations of\ufb02ine, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236 Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237 as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238 The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291,\n293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras\n237\u201338, 241\u201357.

Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly\nmonitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241 identify internet service providers with a\nview to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242 collaborate\nwith the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243 establish\n\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have\nmaterialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law\nenforcement agencies.244 The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-\nsures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government\ncontrol.\nFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245 for\nexample, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-\nlatory scope to the entire territory.246 The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is\nenforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law\nduty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least\nunder 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247\nA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the\ngovernment-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide\nservices in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could\nregulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-\ncontrolled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-\nnications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication\nusing the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249 With regard to those private actors, due\ndiligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance\nfrom its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250 In the case of belligerent occupation,\nhowever, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive\nmeasures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights\ncontrol mechanisms.251\nWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance\nbetween the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content\nto prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point\ntest. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in \ufb01ve Iraqi provinces under\nISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-\nviders to disrupt the use of speci\ufb01c websites and social media by those associated with extremist\ngroups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist \ufb01ghters.252\nWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether\na minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253 The thresh-\nold of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the\nactual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-\nmission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-\nlations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take\npositive measures to protect the victim.254\nThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the\nstandard of action required in the particular case.

Feasibility depends, among others, \u2018on the technical wherewithal of\nthe state concerned, the intellectual and \ufb01nancial resources at its disposal, the state\u2019s institutional\ncapacity to take measures, and the extent of its control over cyber infrastructure\u2019 located in the\ngovernment-controlled territory.255\nThis capacity is to a large extent technical, often referred to as \u2018virtual power\u2019256 or \u2018virtual\ncontrol\u2019, understood as the \u2018ability to intercept, store, analyse and use communications\u2019.257 Since\ngovernments might have very different relationships with the internet and telecommunications\ncompanies that could facilitate surveillance, their capacity to access directly the undersea cables\nand other carriers of internet and telephonic communications might be different. However, \u2018vir-\ntual power\u2019 or \u2018virtual control\u2019 is not the only factor that determines the capacity of the territorial\nstate to comply with its due diligence. Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-\nnical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-\nsure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned\npreventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-\ncontrolled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over\nthe area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online\nhuman rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-\nexistent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective\nterritorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-\nritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction\nof the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-\nritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-\nventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the\nuniversal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the\nlatter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in\nits territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment\n[1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of\nSurveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Con\ufb02ict: Defending\nthe Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state\ncontinues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of\nsovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire\nnational territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control\nits cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and conse-\nquently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect\nin the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive mea-\nsures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the\nseparatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.\nKeywords: international human rights law, due diligence, cyberspace, effective control, Ilas\u0327cu case\n1. INTRODUCTION\nVarious contemporary territorial con\ufb02icts have resulted in areas falling outside the effective con-\ntrol of the sovereign state (territorial state) \u2013 such as Transnistria (1992), Nagorno-Karabakh\n(1988\u201394), South Ossetia (1991\u201392, 2008) and Abkhazia (1992\u201393), Crimea (2014) and the sep-\naratist areas in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to date) \u2013 or vast territories controlled by extremist terrorist\ngroups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State (2014 to date).1 The state\u2019s lack of effective\ncontrol over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is tradition-\nally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign\nterritory.2 Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various\nreasons, such as an armed con\ufb02ict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered\nby an another subject of international law3 \u2013 various norms of international law that bind the\n* University of Pretoria, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the SARChI Professorship on International Constitutional\nLaw (Professor Erika de Wet); Visiting scholar, Manchester International Law Centre, University of\nManchester; antal.berkes@manchester.ac.uk (comments welcome).

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed con\ufb02ict, the law of non-international armed\ncon\ufb02ict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4 it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be \ufb01lled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6 and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7 Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo\n(governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9 second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10 Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had dif\ufb01culties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these de\ufb01ciencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12 The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13 have identi\ufb01ed certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14 Speci\ufb01cally in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine\n2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights\nCannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe\nConvention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force\n1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force\n3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017,\npara 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017,\nExplanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership\nCountries, 3 May 2017, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/603897/EPRS_BRI(2017)\n603897_EN.pdf; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April\n2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the\nTemporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September\n2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Of\ufb01ce of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\n(UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN\nDoc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission\nof Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.\nReferences to media in the cited documents include a particular means of mass communication, that disseminated\nin cyberspace\n11 Section 2 in this article.\n12 Section 4 in this article.\n13 Charter of the United Nations (entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI.\n14 Sections 4 and 5 in this article.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n199\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16 and occupying states,17 the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18 and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19 \u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother. Section 3 con\ufb01rms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the ter-\nritorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the\ncyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights\narising from sovereignty. Section 5 applies the rules of IHRL to the obligations of the territorial\n15 In the same sense see Timothy S Wu, \u2018Cyberspace Sovereignty: The Internet and the International System\nNotes\u2019 (1996) 10 Harvard Journal of Law and Technology 647.\n16 eg, Andrew Clapham, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors (Oxford University Press 2006) 271\u2013316;\nKatharine Fortin, The Accountability of Armed Groups under Human Rights Law (Oxford University Press 2017)\n240\u201384; Murray (n 5) 120\u2013271.\n17 eg, Eyal Benvenisti, \u2018The Applicability of Human Rights Conventions to Israel and to the Occupied Territories\u2019\n(1992) 26 Israel Law Review 24; Orna Ben-Naftali and Yuval Shany, \u2018Living in Denial: The Application of\nHuman Rights in the Occupied Territories\u2019 (2004) 1 Israel Law Review 17; John Cerone, \u2018Human Dignity in\nthe Line of Fire: The Application of International Human Rights Law during Armed Con\ufb02ict, Occupation, and\nPeace Operations\u2019 (2006) 39 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1447; Danio Campanelli, \u2018The Law of\nMilitary Occupation Put to the Test of Human Rights Law\u2019 (2008) 90 International Review of the Red Cross\n653; Noam Lubell, \u2018Human Rights Obligations in Military Occupation\u2019 (2012) 94 International Review of the\nRed Cross 317.\n18 Karine Bannelier-Christakis, \u2018Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity\nCyber Operations\u2019 (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23; Russell Buchan, \u2018Cyberspace, Non-\nState Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm\u2019 (2016) 21 Journal of Con\ufb02ict and Security\nLaw 429; Gabor Rona and Lauren Aarons, \u2018State Responsibility to Respect, Protect and Ful\ufb01ll Human Rights\nObligations in Cyberspace\u2019 (2016) 8 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 503; Matthew J Sklerov,\n\u2018Solving the Dilemma of Sate Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justi\ufb01cation for the Use of Active Defenses against\nStates Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent\u2019 (2009) 201 Military Law Review 1.\n19 Tsagourias (n 4).\n20 Rona and Aarons (n 18) 506\u201309.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n200\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The conclusions provide\nsome recommendations for enhancing human rights compliance of the territorial states concerned\nwithin the positive law framework of IHRL.\n2. CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE\nTERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21\nIt is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders\ncreating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22 and its innovative nature seems to provoke new\nproblems in law, especially in international law.\nThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be de\ufb01ned as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real\nspace, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 \ufb01rst\nof all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication\ntechnology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23\nIn other words, it is a \ufb01ctional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the\nphenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-\nmunications technology (ICT). It follows from the above de\ufb01nition that cyberspace has three\nlayers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network),\nand a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network\n(cyber-persona layer).24 Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical\narchitecture.25\n\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia,\ntelecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26 This article focuses on\nthose cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-\nnationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are\nmore relevant than others in the cyber context. In this regard, the Tallinn Manual, a non-binding\nexpert commentary on the international law applicable to cyber operations, is of guidance as it\n21 John P Barlow, \u2018A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u2019, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 8 February\n1996, https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence.

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online. The violations in cyberspace have been committed by various\nactors, especially non-state de facto authorities, an outside state controlling the area and/or the\nterritorial state.\n27 Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn,\nCambridge University Press 2017) 2\u20133; International Law Commission (ILC), Second Report on the Protection of\nthe Environment in relation to Armed Con\ufb02icts, submitted by Marie G Jacobsson, Special Rapporteur (28 May\n2015), UN Doc A/CN.4/685, para 180.\n28 Schmitt, ibid 187 para 1.

This double\ndif\ufb01culty of control, over the online and of\ufb02ine spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at \ufb01rst sight cyberspace hardly \ufb01ts within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64 also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65 A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by de\ufb01nition, trans-\nboundary character.66 However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67 Today it is widely recognised by states68 and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015),\nUN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-\nlar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019\n(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties\ngoverning cyberspace has increased.70\nThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a\nnovel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless\ntelegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-\ncations in their territory.71 Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-\ntrol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and\nthat a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference\nin the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through\nradio.72 To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the\nsame principles apply.73\nThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the\nsupreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74\neven though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75 The physical\nlayer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-\ntual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a speci\ufb01c state.76\nState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\n\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether\nby legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77 In other words, it is the competence of a state\nto regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the\nContext of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the \ufb01rst international treaty to\nregulate conduct in the cyberspace; Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the\nCriminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems (entered\ninto force 1 March 2006) ETS 189; United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in\nInternational Contracts (entered into force 1 March 2013) 2898 UNTS 1; League of Arab States, Arab\nConvention on Combating Information Technology Offences (entered into force February 2014), see the authentic\nArab text and the rati\ufb01cation status at http://www.lasportal.org/ar/legalnetwork/Pages/agreements_details.\naspx?RID=73 and the English translation at http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Arab_Convention_on_Combating_\nInformation_Technology_Offences; African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection\n(adopted 27 June 2014, not yet in force) (2017) 56 ILM 166.\n71 International Radiotelegraph Convention (London, 5 July 1912), (1913) 10 Treaty Series 139\u2013217, art 1;\nInternational Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (entered into force 2 April\n1938) 186 LNTS 301, art 1; Resolution on Radio-Telegraphic Communications (1927) Annuaire de l\u2019Institut\nde Droit International, session de Lausanne, 287 and 342\u201343, para 1.\n72 Vernon Van Dyke, \u2018The Responsibility of States for International Propaganda\u2019 (1940) 34 American Journal of\nInternational Law 58, 58\u201359; Hersch Lauterpacht, \u2018Revolutionary Propaganda by Governments\u2019 (1927) 13\nTransactions Grotius Society 143, 162; W Friedmann, \u2018The Growth of State Control over the Individual, and\nIts Effect upon the Rules of International State Responsibility\u2019 (1938) 19 British Year Book of International\nLaw 118, 146\u201347.\n73 Schmitt (n 27) 26, 284\u201385, 312\u201335.\n74 ibid 11 para 1.\n75 ibid 60\u201371 (Rules 10\u201311).\n76 Tsagourias (n 24) 21, 27.\n77 Bernard H Oxman, \u2018Jurisdiction of States\u2019 (2007) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law para 1.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n207\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan,\nGeorgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-\nereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside\ntheir effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpeci\ufb01cally in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-\nating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-\ntion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise\njurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\n\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-\nstantial effect in its territory\u2019.87 As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective\nrestatement of the lex lata and,88 as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction\nre\ufb02ects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\nThe \ufb01rst of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a\nperson or an object in the territory of the state provides a suf\ufb01cient basis for the exercise of juris-\ndiction by that state.89 Since information and communication technologies require some physical\ninfrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-\nities in their national territory.90\nFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-\nmunications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the\nstate.91 The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control\nis thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such\nas cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-\nities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s\nterritory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-\nment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity\ncompleted in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92 In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Therefore, the current tendency of state practice is to\ninterpret territorial jurisdiction broadly, where any substantial connection between the cyber\nactivity and state territory might serve as a suf\ufb01cient basis for jurisdiction.94\nRelated to an area outside the state\u2019s effective control, this type of jurisdiction might lead to\nvarious scenarios. Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-\npleted in the area concerned95 and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise\nits criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance.\nUnder \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-\nity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist\n\ufb01ghters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the\nviolation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even\nin another state.96\nThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-\ndictional link accepted to re\ufb02ect customary international law:97 where an activity does not emanate\nfrom or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain\ndomestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98 some scholars contest its applicability\nas it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-\nsites in all countries.99 The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-\nability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the\nstate and the cyber activity than is applied in the of\ufb02ine world.100 Accordingly, the territorial state will\nhave jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-\nfusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber\nactivities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information\nTechnology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur\nfor Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66.\n95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the of\ufb02ine context. Indeed, states101 and international organisations102 have\nrecognised that the rights that people have of\ufb02ine must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103 While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical of\ufb02ine space in that area\nmust be clari\ufb01ed.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104 Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 de\ufb01ned above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and\nDemocracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, https://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/\npdf_2011_05/20110926_110526-G8-Summit-Deauville.pdf; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global\nMulti-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet\nGovernance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/\nNETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace,\nProsperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, https://info.publicintelligence.net/\nWH-InternationalCyberspace.pdf.\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The\nPromotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/\n13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the\nInternet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015\n(n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet\nFreedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society,\nTunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation\nCM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet\nUsers, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights\nTreaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n211\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its\nauthority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or\nrebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the\nterritory of the State concerned\u2019.124 The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-\ncising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\nThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held\nthat it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain\neven where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to\ntake all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the\nwhole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set\nup, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby\ncease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-\nritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual\njurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-\nial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.\nCommentators note that it is a minimum rule of customary character: see Michal Gondek, \u2018Extraterritorial\nApplication of the European Convention on Human Rights: Territorial Focus in the Age of Globalization?\u2019\n(2005) 52 Netherlands International Law Review 349, 350.\n121 Assanidze (n 2) para 139.\n122 ibid para 140.\n123 ECtHR, Ilas\u0327cu and Others v Moldova and Russia, App no 48787/99, 8 July 2004.\n124 ibid para 312.\n125 ibid para 313.\n126 ibid para 333.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n214\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does\nnot affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131 including human rights\ntreaties.132 Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s\neffective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of\nits jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond con\ufb01rming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clari\ufb01ed the kind of\npositive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-\nive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and suf\ufb01cient\u2019 measures\nin order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective\ncontrol.133 The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state\nunder Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive\nobligations towards persons within its territory. The state in question must endeavour, with all the\nlegal and diplomatic means available to it vis-\u00e0-vis foreign states and international organisations, to\ncontinue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms de\ufb01ned in the Convention.\nIn the case of human rights violations committed by de facto authorities in the area, the ECtHR\nwill verify whether the territorial state has complied with a minimum threshold in the particular\ncircumstances \u2013 \u2018to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it\nshould have been made\u2019.135 The territorial state\u2019s positive obligations relate both to the measures\nneeded to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to\n127 ibid paras 20\u201321; Assanidze (n 2) para 140; ECtHR, Sargsyan v Azerbaijan, App no 40167/06, Admissibility,\n14 December 2011, paras 64\u201365.\n128 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49).\n129 Reservations and Declarations for Treaty (n 50).\n130 ECHR (n 29) art 56.\n131 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 39.\n132 ibid art 15(1).\n133 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 334.\n134 ibid para 333.\n135 Ibid para 334.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n215\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations\nin IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state\nhaving lost its territorial control, as it guarantees \ufb02exibility in assessing its particular situation.\nThe state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-\ntive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it\nknew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154 The \ufb01rst condition \u2013 known also as\nthe \u2018capacity to in\ufb02uence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155 \u2013 assesses the actual means\nin the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human\nrights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty,\nstill depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations.\nAccordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective\npower in the particular situation.

The irrebuttable presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction in\nIHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights treaties (the\n\u2018legal space\u2019 and elimination of the vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal\nlevel), but also with the concept of the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 of the territorial state.162 It is\nperhaps too early to speak of an established customary norm,163 but at least international\nhuman rights treaties are interpreted in accordance with the above mentioned practice.164\nThe obligation not to allow the state\u2019s territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of\nother states or individuals binds the state in every activity performed in its territory, including\n156 ibid [431]; Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22 (\u2018the laying of the mine\ufb01eld which caused the explosions on\nOctober 22nd, 1946, could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government\u2019).\n157 Human Rights Council (n 115) para 41; Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment, \u2018Mission to the Republic of Moldova\u2019 (12 February 2009), UN Doc A/HRC/10/44/\nAdd.3, para 6.\n158 The Human Rights Committee has recently elaborated a general comment, providing that \u2018a State party has\nan obligation to respect and to ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all\npersons subject to its jurisdiction\u2019.

It\nequally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-\ngation to protect167 and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes\nof international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of\nthe Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168 However, given the almost universal\nrati\ufb01cation of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide rati\ufb01cation of regional human\nrights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the\nnext section, due diligence and the speci\ufb01c positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely,\nwithin the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-\nside its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-\nnational law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169 This sug-\ngests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative\nframework.170 Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-\nties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state\nin IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have\nrecognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law\n(Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-\nviders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171\nHowever, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-\ntrol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace,\nit appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the\nonline context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-\ntioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has\ncomplied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed\nto re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and\nPrivate Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, https://papers.\nssrn.com/abstract=2941988; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden\nJournal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37,\npara 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression\n(12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n219\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Before exam-\nining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the\nfocus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-\ntions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights\nmonitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the\nterritorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s\nobligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-\ntions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to\nlife of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment\nthrough online means,173 and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to\nracial hatred174 or to terrorism.175 In this regard, there is no difference between government-\ncontrolled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial\nstate in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or \ufb01ltering commu-\nnications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176 A \ufb01rst possible legal\nbasis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of\nemergency. Under such a derogation, a state may suspend provisionally the application of one\nor more human rights, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation at a\ntime of suf\ufb01ciently grave crisis that threatens the life of the nation, provided that such measures\nare not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.177 While the territorial state\nmay derogate in respect of certain human rights, such as freedom of expression, it cannot limit\n172 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339; Catan (n 136) para 145; Mozer (n 136) para 151.\n173 Cyber threats might cause mental suffering of such severity that would violate the prohibition of torture, or\ninhuman or degrading treatment: ECtHR G\u00e4fgen v Germany, App no 22978/05, 1 June 2010, para 108;\nHuman Rights Committee, General Comment No 20: Article 7 (27 May 2008), UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9\n(Vol I), 200\u201302 para 5.\n174 CERD (n 30) art 4; ICCPR (n 29) art 20; CERD, General Recommendation No 35: Combating Racist Hate\nSpeech (26 September 2013), UN Doc CERD/C/GC/35.\n175 UNSC Res 2253 (17 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2253 (2015), para 22; UNGA, Report of the Special\nRapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression (10 August\n2011), UN Doc A/66/290, para 81.\n176 eg, the Ukrainian presidential decree of 16 May 2017 targeted \u2018legal entities of the Russian Federation, the\nactivity of which threatens information and cyber security of Ukraine\u2019: see Human Rights Committee (n 6)\npara 95, n 103.\n177 ECHR (n 29) art 15(1); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(1); American Convention on Human Rights (entered into\nforce 18 July 1978) 1144 UNTS 143 (ACHR), art 27(1); Arab Charter on Human Rights (entered into force\n15 March 2008), (2005) 12 International Human Rights Reports 893, art 4(b).\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n220\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-\nsures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere\nexpression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188 irrespective of the inef-\nfectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the\nterritorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189 Such measures could be\nconsidered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190 or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to\nre-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191\nWhile it is indeed dif\ufb01cult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals\nrather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter\nstandard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192 would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-\nment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193 and to reassert its\nresponsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and\ninternationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-\nmatic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to\nnormalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194 The measures to re-establish\ncontrol over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending\naccess to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14,\n12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\nI-11959,\n[47]\u2013[54];\nHuman\nRights\nCommittee,\nConcluding\nObservations:\nIslamic\nRepublic\nof\nIran\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding\nObservations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Del\ufb01AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Re\ufb02ections on\nEvolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143.\n191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67\nInternational and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Of\ufb01ce 1906)\n962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n222\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197 the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198 cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199 or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200 are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate. However, it is problematic if the state restricts internet/telecommu-\nnications for an extended period in order to re-assert control over its territory, while the same\nmeasures violate individuals\u2019 human rights and thus run against the third type of obligation\n(below).

In recent years, human rights\ntreaty monitoring bodies have clari\ufb01ed various positive obligations that states have in\ncyberspace.206\nAs mentioned above, in areas outside the effective control of the state special measures with\nthe aim of protecting the rights of individuals include positive duties \u2018to take the diplomatic, eco-\nnomic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with inter-\nnational law\u2019.207 As a translation of the due diligence standard, the anticipated measures depend\non the context and must be reasonable \u2013 commensurate with the territorial state\u2019s limited ability\nto protect human rights in an area outside its effective control.208 In the face of online human\nrights violations, the most relevant measures are providing remedies (5.3.1) and preventive mea-\nsures (5.3.2).\n5.3.1.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234 The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to in\ufb02uence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235 In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed con\ufb02ict with grave\nhuman rights violations of\ufb02ine, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236 Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237 as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238 The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291,\n293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras\n237\u201338, 241\u201357. The difference between the rulings of the Chamber and the Grand Chamber is the extent to which\nthe state is expected to take reasonable steps to cooperate.

Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly\nmonitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241 identify internet service providers with a\nview to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242 collaborate\nwith the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243 establish\n\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have\nmaterialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law\nenforcement agencies.244 The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-\nsures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government\ncontrol.\nFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245 for\nexample, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-\nlatory scope to the entire territory.246 The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is\nenforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law\nduty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least\nunder 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247\nA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the\ngovernment-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide\nservices in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could\nregulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-\ncontrolled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-\nnications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication\nusing the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249 With regard to those private actors, due\ndiligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance\nfrom its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250 In the case of belligerent occupation,\nhowever, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive\nmeasures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights\ncontrol mechanisms.251\nWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance\nbetween the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content\nto prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point\ntest. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in \ufb01ve Iraqi provinces under\nISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-\nviders to disrupt the use of speci\ufb01c websites and social media by those associated with extremist\ngroups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist \ufb01ghters.252\nWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether\na minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253 The thresh-\nold of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the\nactual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-\nmission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-\nlations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take\npositive measures to protect the victim.254\nThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the\nstandard of action required in the particular case.

Feasibility depends, among others, \u2018on the technical wherewithal of\nthe state concerned, the intellectual and \ufb01nancial resources at its disposal, the state\u2019s institutional\ncapacity to take measures, and the extent of its control over cyber infrastructure\u2019 located in the\ngovernment-controlled territory.255\nThis capacity is to a large extent technical, often referred to as \u2018virtual power\u2019256 or \u2018virtual\ncontrol\u2019, understood as the \u2018ability to intercept, store, analyse and use communications\u2019.257 Since\ngovernments might have very different relationships with the internet and telecommunications\ncompanies that could facilitate surveillance, their capacity to access directly the undersea cables\nand other carriers of internet and telephonic communications might be different. However, \u2018vir-\ntual power\u2019 or \u2018virtual control\u2019 is not the only factor that determines the capacity of the territorial\nstate to comply with its due diligence. Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-\nnical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-\nsure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned\npreventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-\ncontrolled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over\nthe area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online\nhuman rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-\nexistent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective\nterritorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-\nritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction\nof the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-\nritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-\nventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the\nuniversal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the\nlatter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in\nits territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment\n[1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of\nSurveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Con\ufb02ict: Defending\nthe Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state\ncontinues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of\nsovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire\nnational territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control\nits cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and conse-\nquently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect\nin the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive mea-\nsures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the\nseparatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.\nKeywords: international human rights law, due diligence, cyberspace, effective control, Ilas\u0327cu case\n1.

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed con\ufb02ict, the law of non-international armed\ncon\ufb02ict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4 it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be \ufb01lled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6 and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7 Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo\n(governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-\nni\ufb01cantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9 second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10 Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had dif\ufb01culties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these de\ufb01ciencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12 The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13 have identi\ufb01ed certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14 Speci\ufb01cally in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine\n2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights\nCannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe\nConvention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force\n1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force\n3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017,\npara 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017,\nExplanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership\nCountries, 3 May 2017, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2017/603897/EPRS_BRI(2017)\n603897_EN.pdf; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April\n2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the\nTemporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September\n2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Of\ufb01ce of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights\n(UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN\nDoc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission\nof Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.\nReferences to media in the cited documents include a particular means of mass communication, that disseminated\nin cyberspace\n11 Section 2 in this article.\n12 Section 4 in this article.\n13 Charter of the United Nations (entered into force 24 October 1945) 1 UNTS XVI.\n14 Sections 4 and 5 in this article.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n199\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16 and occupying states,17 the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18 and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19 \u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother.

The conclusions provide\nsome recommendations for enhancing human rights compliance of the territorial states concerned\nwithin the positive law framework of IHRL.\n2. CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE\nTERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21\nIt is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders\ncreating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22 and its innovative nature seems to provoke new\nproblems in law, especially in international law.\nThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be de\ufb01ned as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real\nspace, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 \ufb01rst\nof all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication\ntechnology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23\nIn other words, it is a \ufb01ctional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the\nphenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-\nmunications technology (ICT). It follows from the above de\ufb01nition that cyberspace has three\nlayers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network),\nand a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network\n(cyber-persona layer).24 Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical\narchitecture.25\n\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia,\ntelecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26 This article focuses on\nthose cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-\nnationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are\nmore relevant than others in the cyber context. In this regard, the Tallinn Manual, a non-binding\nexpert commentary on the international law applicable to cyber operations, is of guidance as it\n21 John P Barlow, \u2018A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u2019, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 8 February\n1996, https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence.

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online. The violations in cyberspace have been committed by various\nactors, especially non-state de facto authorities, an outside state controlling the area and/or the\nterritorial state.\n27 Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn,\nCambridge University Press 2017) 2\u20133; International Law Commission (ILC), Second Report on the Protection of\nthe Environment in relation to Armed Con\ufb02icts, submitted by Marie G Jacobsson, Special Rapporteur (28 May\n2015), UN Doc A/CN.4/685, para 180.\n28 Schmitt, ibid 187 para 1.

Therefore, as far as the territorial state might control cyber activities from the\ngovernment-administered area, it might retain limited power with regard to online human rights\nviolations committed in the area outside its effective control.\nThe existence of areas that escape the effective control of the territorial state not only facil-\nitates massive human rights violations, but may constitute a threat to international peace and\nsecurity.55 The UN Security Council has expressed concern over the fact that ISIL used the inter-\nnet and social media as promotional and recruitment tools for terrorist purposes56 and for the\nonline sale of Iraqi and Syrian antiquities.57 Considering that the atrocities committed by ISIL\nmay amount to crimes against humanity and possibly genocide,58 the concept of \u2018responsibility\nto protect\u2019 has been applied.59 Accordingly, the Security Council has underlined \u2018the need for\nMember States to act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communica-\ntions and resources to incite support for terrorist acts\u201960 and reiterated that \u2018the primary\n52 ICT for Peace Foundation and UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (UNCTED), \u2018Private\nSector Engagement in Responding to the Use of the Internet and ICT for Terrorist Purposes: Strengthening\nDialogue\nand\nBuilding\nTrust\u2019,\n5,\nhttps://www.un.org/sc/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Private-Sector-\nEngagement-in-Responding-to-the-Use-of-the-Internet-and-ICT-for-Terrorist-Purposes.pdf.\n53 Peter Margulies, \u2018Surveillance by Algorithm: The NSA, Computerized Intelligence Collection, and Human\nRights\u2019 (2017) 68 Florida Law Review 1045, 1088; Nadiya Kostyuk, \u2018Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?\u2019 in\nKenneth Geers (ed), Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine (NATO CCD COE\nPublications 2015) 115.\n54 Marie Baezner, \u2018Cyber and Information Warfare in the Ukrainian Con\ufb02ict\u2019, Center for Security Studies (CSS)\nCyber Defense Project, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 2017, 10.\n55 UNSC Res 2170 (15 August 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2170, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2249 (20 November\n2015), UN Doc S/RES/2249, preambular para 8.\n56 UNSC Res 2170, ibid, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2395 (21 December 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2395,\npreambular para 27.\n57 UNSC Res 2199 (12 February 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2199, para 16.\n58 Human Rights Council, \u2018Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, \u201cThey Came to Destroy\u201d: ISIS\nCrimes Against the Yazidis\u2019 (15 June 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/32/CRP.2.\n59 See the \ufb01rst pillar of the theory of \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019: UNGA Res 60/1(24 October 2005), UN Doc\nA/RES/60/1(2005), para 138, and the numerous resolutions of the Security Council con\ufb01rming this obligation:\neg, recently UNSC Res 2399 (30 January 2018), UN Doc S/RES/2399, preambular para 3; UNSC Res 2337\n(19 January 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2337, preambular para 9.

This double\ndif\ufb01culty of control, over the online and of\ufb02ine spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at \ufb01rst sight cyberspace hardly \ufb01ts within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64 also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65 A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by de\ufb01nition, trans-\nboundary character.66 However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67 Today it is widely recognised by states68 and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015),\nUN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-\nlar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019\n(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties\ngoverning cyberspace has increased.70\nThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a\nnovel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless\ntelegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-\ncations in their territory.71 Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-\ntrol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and\nthat a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference\nin the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through\nradio.72 To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the\nsame principles apply.73\nThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the\nsupreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74\neven though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75 The physical\nlayer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-\ntual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a speci\ufb01c state.76\nState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\n\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether\nby legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77 In other words, it is the competence of a state\nto regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the\nContext of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the \ufb01rst international treaty to\nregulate conduct in the cyberspace; Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the\nCriminalisation of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems (entered\ninto force 1 March 2006) ETS 189; United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in\nInternational Contracts (entered into force 1 March 2013) 2898 UNTS 1; League of Arab States, Arab\nConvention on Combating Information Technology Offences (entered into force February 2014), see the authentic\nArab text and the rati\ufb01cation status at http://www.lasportal.org/ar/legalnetwork/Pages/agreements_details.\naspx?RID=73 and the English translation at http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Arab_Convention_on_Combating_\nInformation_Technology_Offences; African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection\n(adopted 27 June 2014, not yet in force) (2017) 56 ILM 166.\n71 International Radiotelegraph Convention (London, 5 July 1912), (1913) 10 Treaty Series 139\u2013217, art 1;\nInternational Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (entered into force 2 April\n1938) 186 LNTS 301, art 1; Resolution on Radio-Telegraphic Communications (1927) Annuaire de l\u2019Institut\nde Droit International, session de Lausanne, 287 and 342\u201343, para 1.\n72 Vernon Van Dyke, \u2018The Responsibility of States for International Propaganda\u2019 (1940) 34 American Journal of\nInternational Law 58, 58\u201359; Hersch Lauterpacht, \u2018Revolutionary Propaganda by Governments\u2019 (1927) 13\nTransactions Grotius Society 143, 162; W Friedmann, \u2018The Growth of State Control over the Individual, and\nIts Effect upon the Rules of International State Responsibility\u2019 (1938) 19 British Year Book of International\nLaw 118, 146\u201347.\n73 Schmitt (n 27) 26, 284\u201385, 312\u201335.\n74 ibid 11 para 1.\n75 ibid 60\u201371 (Rules 10\u201311).\n76 Tsagourias (n 24) 21, 27.\n77 Bernard H Oxman, \u2018Jurisdiction of States\u2019 (2007) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law para 1.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n207\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan,\nGeorgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-\nereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside\ntheir effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpeci\ufb01cally in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-\nating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-\ntion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise\njurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\n\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-\nstantial effect in its territory\u2019.87 As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective\nrestatement of the lex lata and,88 as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction\nre\ufb02ects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\nThe \ufb01rst of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a\nperson or an object in the territory of the state provides a suf\ufb01cient basis for the exercise of juris-\ndiction by that state.89 Since information and communication technologies require some physical\ninfrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-\nities in their national territory.90\nFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-\nmunications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the\nstate.91 The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control\nis thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such\nas cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-\nities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s\nterritory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-\nment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity\ncompleted in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92 In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-\npleted in the area concerned95 and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise\nits criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance.\nUnder \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-\nity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist\n\ufb01ghters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the\nviolation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even\nin another state.96\nThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-\ndictional link accepted to re\ufb02ect customary international law:97 where an activity does not emanate\nfrom or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain\ndomestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98 some scholars contest its applicability\nas it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-\nsites in all countries.99 The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-\nability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the\nstate and the cyber activity than is applied in the of\ufb02ine world.100 Accordingly, the territorial state will\nhave jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-\nfusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber\nactivities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information\nTechnology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur\nfor Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66.\n95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the of\ufb02ine context. Indeed, states101 and international organisations102 have\nrecognised that the rights that people have of\ufb02ine must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103 While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical of\ufb02ine space in that area\nmust be clari\ufb01ed.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104 Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 de\ufb01ned above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and\nDemocracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, https://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/\npdf_2011_05/20110926_110526-G8-Summit-Deauville.pdf; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global\nMulti-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet\nGovernance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, http://netmundial.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/\nNETmundial-Multistakeholder-Document.pdf; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace,\nProsperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, https://info.publicintelligence.net/\nWH-InternationalCyberspace.pdf.\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The\nPromotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/\n13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the\nInternet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015\n(n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet\nFreedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society,\nTunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation\nCM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet\nUsers, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights\nTreaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n211\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its\nauthority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or\nrebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the\nterritory of the State concerned\u2019.124 The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-\ncising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\nThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held\nthat it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain\neven where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to\ntake all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the\nwhole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set\nup, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby\ncease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-\nritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual\njurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-\nial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.\nCommentators note that it is a minimum rule of customary character: see Michal Gondek, \u2018Extraterritorial\nApplication of the European Convention on Human Rights: Territorial Focus in the Age of Globalization?\u2019\n(2005) 52 Netherlands International Law Review 349, 350.\n121 Assanidze (n 2) para 139.\n122 ibid para 140.\n123 ECtHR, Ilas\u0327cu and Others v Moldova and Russia, App no 48787/99, 8 July 2004.\n124 ibid para 312.\n125 ibid para 313.\n126 ibid para 333.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n214\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does\nnot affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131 including human rights\ntreaties.132 Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s\neffective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of\nits jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond con\ufb01rming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clari\ufb01ed the kind of\npositive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-\nive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and suf\ufb01cient\u2019 measures\nin order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective\ncontrol.133 The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state\nunder Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive\nobligations towards persons within its territory. The state in question must endeavour, with all the\nlegal and diplomatic means available to it vis-\u00e0-vis foreign states and international organisations, to\ncontinue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms de\ufb01ned in the Convention.\nIn the case of human rights violations committed by de facto authorities in the area, the ECtHR\nwill verify whether the territorial state has complied with a minimum threshold in the particular\ncircumstances \u2013 \u2018to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it\nshould have been made\u2019.135 The territorial state\u2019s positive obligations relate both to the measures\nneeded to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to\n127 ibid paras 20\u201321; Assanidze (n 2) para 140; ECtHR, Sargsyan v Azerbaijan, App no 40167/06, Admissibility,\n14 December 2011, paras 64\u201365.\n128 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49).\n129 Reservations and Declarations for Treaty (n 50).\n130 ECHR (n 29) art 56.\n131 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 39.\n132 ibid art 15(1).\n133 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 334.\n134 ibid para 333.\n135 Ibid para 334.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n215\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations\nin IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state\nhaving lost its territorial control, as it guarantees \ufb02exibility in assessing its particular situation.\nThe state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-\ntive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it\nknew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154 The \ufb01rst condition \u2013 known also as\nthe \u2018capacity to in\ufb02uence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155 \u2013 assesses the actual means\nin the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human\nrights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty,\nstill depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations.\nAccordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective\npower in the particular situation. According to the second condition, the state is responsible\nonly if the human rights violation actually occurred and if the state was aware of, or should\n146 Catan (n 136) para 147; ECtHR Vardanean v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 22200/10, 30 May\n2017, para 42.\n147 Ivan\u0163oc (n 143) para 109; Vardanean, ibid para 42.\n148 Island of Palmas Case (n 80) 839.\n149 Trail Smelter Case (US, Canada) (1938, 1941) III UNRIAA 1965; in the same sense Corfu Channel Case (UK\nv Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\n150 Corfu Channel case, ibid 18.\n151 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay) (Merits) [2010] ICJ Rep 14, 55\u201356 [101].\n152 Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22; Timo Koivurova, \u2018Due Diligence\u2019, (2010) MPEPIL, para 2.\n153 Case of Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Merits) (1988) Inter-Am CtHR, Judgment of 29 July 1988, (Ser C)\nNo 4, [172].\n154 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and\nHerzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, [430]\u2013[431].\n155 ibid [430].\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n217\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, UN Charter-based human rights bodies157 and universal treaty monitoring bod-\nies158 have reiterated the same standard and addressed various positive obligations with regard to\nindividuals in areas outside government control in their concluding observations on territorial\nstates.159 While the ECtHR has based this case law on the necessity to cover the European\n\u2018legal space\u2019 by the effective application of the ECHR160 and to eliminate \u2018vacuums\u2019 at the\nregional level,161 UN treaty monitoring bodies seek to ensure the universality of human rights\nwith the same practice. The irrebuttable presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction in\nIHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights treaties (the\n\u2018legal space\u2019 and elimination of the vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal\nlevel), but also with the concept of the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 of the territorial state.162 It is\nperhaps too early to speak of an established customary norm,163 but at least international\nhuman rights treaties are interpreted in accordance with the above mentioned practice.164\nThe obligation not to allow the state\u2019s territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of\nother states or individuals binds the state in every activity performed in its territory, including\n156 ibid [431]; Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22 (\u2018the laying of the mine\ufb01eld which caused the explosions on\nOctober 22nd, 1946, could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government\u2019).\n157 Human Rights Council (n 115) para 41; Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment, \u2018Mission to the Republic of Moldova\u2019 (12 February 2009), UN Doc A/HRC/10/44/\nAdd.3, para 6.\n158 The Human Rights Committee has recently elaborated a general comment, providing that \u2018a State party has\nan obligation to respect and to ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all\npersons subject to its jurisdiction\u2019.

It\nequally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-\ngation to protect167 and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes\nof international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of\nthe Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168 However, given the almost universal\nrati\ufb01cation of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide rati\ufb01cation of regional human\nrights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the\nnext section, due diligence and the speci\ufb01c positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely,\nwithin the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-\nside its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-\nnational law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169 This sug-\ngests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative\nframework.170 Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-\nties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state\nin IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have\nrecognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law\n(Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-\nviders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171\nHowever, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-\ntrol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace,\nit appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the\nonline context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-\ntioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has\ncomplied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed\nto re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and\nPrivate Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, https://papers.\nssrn.com/abstract=2941988; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden\nJournal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37,\npara 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression\n(12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\n2019]\nHUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n219\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Before exam-\nining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the\nfocus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-\ntions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights\nmonitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the\nterritorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s\nobligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-\ntions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to\nlife of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment\nthrough online means,173 and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to\nracial hatred174 or to terrorism.175 In this regard, there is no difference between government-\ncontrolled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial\nstate in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or \ufb01ltering commu-\nnications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176 A \ufb01rst possible legal\nbasis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of\nemergency. Under such a derogation, a state may suspend provisionally the application of one\nor more human rights, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation at a\ntime of suf\ufb01ciently grave crisis that threatens the life of the nation, provided that such measures\nare not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.177 While the territorial state\nmay derogate in respect of certain human rights, such as freedom of expression, it cannot limit\n172 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339; Catan (n 136) para 145; Mozer (n 136) para 151.\n173 Cyber threats might cause mental suffering of such severity that would violate the prohibition of torture, or\ninhuman or degrading treatment: ECtHR G\u00e4fgen v Germany, App no 22978/05, 1 June 2010, para 108;\nHuman Rights Committee, General Comment No 20: Article 7 (27 May 2008), UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9\n(Vol I), 200\u201302 para 5.\n174 CERD (n 30) art 4; ICCPR (n 29) art 20; CERD, General Recommendation No 35: Combating Racist Hate\nSpeech (26 September 2013), UN Doc CERD/C/GC/35.\n175 UNSC Res 2253 (17 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2253 (2015), para 22; UNGA, Report of the Special\nRapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression (10 August\n2011), UN Doc A/66/290, para 81.\n176 eg, the Ukrainian presidential decree of 16 May 2017 targeted \u2018legal entities of the Russian Federation, the\nactivity of which threatens information and cyber security of Ukraine\u2019: see Human Rights Committee (n 6)\npara 95, n 103.\n177 ECHR (n 29) art 15(1); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(1); American Convention on Human Rights (entered into\nforce 18 July 1978) 1144 UNTS 143 (ACHR), art 27(1); Arab Charter on Human Rights (entered into force\n15 March 2008), (2005) 12 International Human Rights Reports 893, art 4(b).\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n220\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-\nsures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere\nexpression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188 irrespective of the inef-\nfectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the\nterritorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189 Such measures could be\nconsidered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190 or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to\nre-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191\nWhile it is indeed dif\ufb01cult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals\nrather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter\nstandard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192 would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-\nment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193 and to reassert its\nresponsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and\ninternationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-\nmatic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to\nnormalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194 The measures to re-establish\ncontrol over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending\naccess to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14,\n12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\nI-11959,\n[47]\u2013[54];\nHuman\nRights\nCommittee,\nConcluding\nObservations:\nIslamic\nRepublic\nof\nIran\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding\nObservations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Del\ufb01AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Re\ufb02ections on\nEvolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143.\n191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67\nInternational and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Of\ufb01ce 1906)\n962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nISRAEL LAW REVIEW\n[Vol. 52:2\n222\navailable at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021223719000050\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197 the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198 cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199 or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200 are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234 The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to in\ufb02uence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235 In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed con\ufb02ict with grave\nhuman rights violations of\ufb02ine, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236 Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237 as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238 The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291,\n293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras\n237\u201338, 241\u201357.

Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly\nmonitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241 identify internet service providers with a\nview to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242 collaborate\nwith the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243 establish\n\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have\nmaterialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law\nenforcement agencies.244 The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-\nsures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government\ncontrol.\nFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245 for\nexample, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-\nlatory scope to the entire territory.246 The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is\nenforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law\nduty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least\nunder 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247\nA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the\ngovernment-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide\nservices in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could\nregulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-\ncontrolled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-\nnications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication\nusing the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249 With regard to those private actors, due\ndiligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance\nfrom its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250 In the case of belligerent occupation,\nhowever, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive\nmeasures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights\ncontrol mechanisms.251\nWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance\nbetween the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content\nto prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point\ntest. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in \ufb01ve Iraqi provinces under\nISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-\nviders to disrupt the use of speci\ufb01c websites and social media by those associated with extremist\ngroups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist \ufb01ghters.252\nWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether\na minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253 The thresh-\nold of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the\nactual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-\nmission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-\nlations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take\npositive measures to protect the victim.254\nThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the\nstandard of action required in the particular case.

Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-\nnical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-\nsure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned\npreventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-\ncontrolled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over\nthe area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online\nhuman rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-\nexistent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective\nterritorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-\nritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction\nof the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-\nritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-\nventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the\nuniversal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the\nlatter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in\nits territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment\n[1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of\nSurveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Con\ufb02ict: Defending\nthe Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

The territorial state is obliged to use its\ninvestigative and judicial capabilities, legislate and regulate non-state actors in the entire national\nterritory, and seek international cooperation in reacting to online human rights violations.\nAs a result of technological progress, the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction is a\nfortiori applicable to cyberspace where the state can ensure the re-establishment of its control\nover human rights violations, even in the absence of territorial control. Given that most territorial\nstates retain some information and telecommunications infrastructures in their government-\ncontrolled area, applying the so-called due diligence standard to human rights in cyberspace\nin areas outside the effective control of the territorial state is feasible. Consequently, national\nlegislation, cyber security strategies, military manuals and doctrinal commentaries like the\nTallinn Manual258 should expressly recognise that the state is presumed to have jurisdiction\nunder IHRL over its entire territory, even in the absence of effective control over it.\nA revised Tallinn Manual should integrate the due diligence standard in its chapter on IHRL\nwith a view to conceptualising the obligation to protect259 and establish systemic integration\nbetween the general and the special regimes applicable to cyber operations.

States are heavily dependent on the use of \ncyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an \nincreasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, \nhave similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of \nproperty.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the \neconomic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially \ndangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations \nfall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This \nraises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can \ndeal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both \nregional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \nCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. \nFirst of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a \nsignificant level of anonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. \nAll of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State \nactors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute \nwhether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlow expressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace \nand that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that \ncyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is \nborderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that \ncyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs \nand Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure \nCyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), \nNational Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow. \n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber \noperations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible \noption. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, \nregulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject \nto international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the \napplication of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how \ninternational law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of \ninternational law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \nInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different \nfora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the \nregulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \non the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8 A Group of \nGovernmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to \nstrengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN \nGGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before \nfailing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \nCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is \nhappening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. \nAs an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a \ntraditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support \ncyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist \nin applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility \ngenerally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State. Attributing cyber acts \nto States is difficult because of the special features of cyberspace and because many of \n \n7 See for example Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 13 and Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the \nInternational Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3.

Therefore, it has been suggested that \nattribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \nHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of \nStates. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states \nthat it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary \ninternational law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States \nto not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that \nthe State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stop the \nattack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace \nor not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2 Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow \nknowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to \nactivities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as \nformulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed. \n1.3 Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal \nresponsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of \ninternational organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State \nresponsibility, but not relevant for the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in \norder to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle \napplies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the \nuse of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules \nabout use of force.

Public \ninternational law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. \nIn international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all \nStates. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able \nto interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of \ninternational law are different from the sources of domestic law. \nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ19 contains the most widely recognized \nauthoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law.20 The article \nstates that  \n \n16 See Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31 for a \ndiscussion about the terminology. \n17 See Lehrberg p. 201 and Hjertstedt p. 167. \n18 Shaw p. 49. \n19 United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice (18 April 1946). \n20 Shaw p. 50. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long \nas the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of \nevery single State of the world. \nOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a \ncertain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so.

One of the challenges \nwhen applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the \ncustomary rule. \n \n1.4.2 The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed \nthrough international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand \nthe principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding \ncyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually \nclassified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements \nregarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability \nof due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and \nopinio juris. \nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. \nThe few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due \ndiligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of \nenvironmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to \ndue diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary \nlaw. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence \nrule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement \nof the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nis not an official document or an official source of international law.

The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, \nintegrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on \nthe territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \n\u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems \nare built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res \ncommunis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that \ncyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal \none.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory \nand involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may \nexercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be \ninternational in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or \nentities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \nThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d.

Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \nIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication \nTechnologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is \nthat ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or \nsubsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or \ninformation\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, \nwireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the \nsource of a misuse or the target of such.53 \n2.2 What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \nAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber \nactivity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or \nemploys means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d. 55 Cyber operations are \nfurther defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through \ncyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. \nA cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether \noffensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused \nto describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO \nGlossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, \nnamely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to \ndisrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence \nprinciple in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A \nGlossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security \nStrategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. \n55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Since the due diligence principle as \nformulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which \nis unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \nWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will \nbe used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. \nthe State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose \nterritory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is \nlocated, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber \noperation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these \ncyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals \nwith ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt \nsoftware and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical \ninfrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential \nconsequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the \nmilitary command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail \nand aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, \nweapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64 \nCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is \nimportant to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. \n61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyberspace is \nborderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily \naccessible for many actors, including non-State actors. Because of the special character \nof cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public \ninternational law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not \nwithin any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most \ngenerally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing \nelse, if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless \nland. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts \nof acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal \nvoid, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security. \nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur \nin cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind \nthe cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more \nStates. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international \nlaw as usual. \nThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law \napplies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has \nbeen acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nfurther states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty \nis part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN \nCharter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \nFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct \ncyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in \ninternational law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and \nthis is true also for cyber operations.71 \nThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed \nsince it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace.

State responsibility is a central principle of public \ninternational law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The \nprinciple stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one \nState commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State \nresponsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of \nan international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and \nwho may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \nThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 \nAugust 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft \nArticles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly \nin a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, \nwhich is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77 \n3.2 The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State \nresponsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international \nresponsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, \nregardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. \nAccording to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). \n76 Shaw p. 568.

The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80  \nAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles \non State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of \nthat State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of \nits origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international \nobligation is.81 \nOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered \nby an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal \nliterature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective \nresponsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson \nholds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation \nincludes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of \nwhether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 \nestablished that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally \nwrongful act.88 \nAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled \nas an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached \nis owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the \ninternational community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must \nspecifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the \nposition of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further \nperformance of the obligation. \n \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87 Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles \non State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an \ninternationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. \nThis element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not \nthe one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of \nthe State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The \nrules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself.  \nThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to \nexercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under \ninternational law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes \ninstructions. \nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility \nis that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State \nunder international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the \ninstructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. \nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit \nwould in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of \nthe military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were \ncommitted\u201d.93 \n \n89 Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and \nthe State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

The main reason \nfor introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation \nto cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4 The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for \nestablishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of \ninternationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations \nproduce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been \ndescribed as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often \ndiscussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of \ninternational cyber law. \nAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important \nmatter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, \nidentifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution \nin cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \nFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This \nis not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to \nit. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the \ncomputer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address \nso that it is not trackable. Not only that, but if the actor uses a network modification \ntechnique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in \nfact is.97 \n \n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. \n96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Example output: <div><h3>[Key Term]</h3><blockquote>[Definition with the whole paragraph, where the definition is in strong highlighted]</blockquote></div>.\n\ntext: 27 \n \nThe second part of the problem, which is perhaps even more daunting, is that it is \nnecessary to identify the person, or the group, operating the computer. Attribution \nattempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if \nthe location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the \nperson behind the act can be identified.98 \nFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established \nand the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus \nbetween the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find \na \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the \ninjury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to \nprevent genocide.101 \nTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber \noperation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several \ncomputers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated \nby different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber \noperations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further \nstates that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \nAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States \nresponsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the \nrisk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able \nto use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5 Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign \nand equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If \nthat happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State \nbreaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as \ncountermeasures. \n \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100 Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. \n103 Ibid p. 230. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first \nparagraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State \nwhich is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to \ncomply with its obligations under the draft articles.

The first one is by \nattribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in \nprevious chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence \nprinciple. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the \ndue diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, \nmilitary responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the \nthreshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate.  \nThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber \noperations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more \ncommon with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of \ncyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are \ngenerally not able to be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, \nusually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have \ninternational responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent \nthe act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, \nnot the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence \nhave previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility. 112 \nDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the \ncontext and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle \nin Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, \nits development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in \nthe field of cyberspace. \n4.2 The history of due diligence \nAs has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that \ntheir territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State.

The principle \nof sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence \nis derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty \nwas interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other \nStates.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 \ninvolves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary \na duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular \ntheir right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right \nto exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there \nneeds to be a corresponding legal obligation.  \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on \nthe circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. \nThe articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other \nstandards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence \nor want of due diligence.

For example, in the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute \nbetween the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, \nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner \nas to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or \npersons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence.128 \nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. \nThere was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. \nInstead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international \nprinciple.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that \nthe obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal \nonly expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One \nmight claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to \nthe specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle \nof environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the \ndevelopment of due diligence in environmental law is examined. \nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case \nlaw. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle \noutside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel \ncase. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case tried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held \nAlbania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their \nomission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation \nnot to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle.

It is also \nparticularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of \nresponsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \nAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part \nof customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law \n(including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 \nThey explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its \ndesirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral \nstandards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact \nresult or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the \nmore general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time.

Because \nof this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when \nassessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and \nscope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of \ninternational treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve \nthe marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all \nmeasures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so \nconducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. \nShaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally \nas the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due \ndiligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation \nprescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other \nrelevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the \nprevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. \nDue diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from \nHazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate \nmeasures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d. \nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization \nmeasures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that \nwill determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the \npresent articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended \nto guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to \ndo so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. \n143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous \nActivities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two \n(2001). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In this sense, it does not guarantee that \nthe harm would not occur.147 \nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of \nconduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The \nState simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills \nits due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS \nsimilarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable \nmeans at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not \nstated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating \nprevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a \nstricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. \nWhat is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness \nincluded in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its \nobligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, \nfor example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, \nor use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly \nexpressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. \nThe Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case \nconcerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the \nUnited States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States \nand a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the \nreference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a \nprivate company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, \nthe State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its \nterritory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \n\u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental \nstatement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter \nPulp Mills]. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, for example, to argue that \nthe Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle \nshould be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of \nenvironmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument \ndoes not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in \nenvironmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to \nthe specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in \nrelation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant \ntransboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to \ncontext. There is not one standard of due diligence which applies to all primary rules.152 \nThis was confirmed by the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion.153 The Seabed Mining \nAdvisory Opinion (2011)154 concerned the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga \nwho both put forward applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the \narea reserved for the conduct of activities by the Seabed Mining Authority.

In \nPulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general \ninternational law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk \nthat the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a \ntransboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental \nimpact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain \nActivities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent \nsignificant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural \nobligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to \nnotify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \nThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be \ndivided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary \nharm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an \nEIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, \nif there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with \nthe potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate \nmeasures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk \nascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State \ndetermines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult \nthe affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the \nobligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe \nJudgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State \nof origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been \nestablished.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one \ncircumstance.

At this \nmoment, there is no such conclusive State practice or opinio juris.

This also follows the \nprerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of \ninternational law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is \nsuch a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the \narea of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context.

The main \nquestion to be answered is what the content of the applicable principle will be. \n4.5 The scope of due diligence \n4.5.1 General notes about the scope \nRule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle in cyberspace: \nA State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or \ncyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber \noperations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences \nfor, other States.187 \nThe basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise \ndue diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not \nused to harm other States\u201d.188 The International Group of Experts have used the \ncommonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle \nin the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct \nexpected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.189 \nThe due diligence principle applies to all third party cyber operations. It does not matter \nif the cyber operation is carried out by a private person, a corporation, a non-State actor, \nor a State.190 \n \n187 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n188 Ibid. \n189 Ibid. \n190 Ibid p. 32. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It \nwill cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the \nprinciple. \n \n4.5.2 Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to \namount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it \nwould not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation \nif the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example \nregarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using \ncyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to \nterminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber \nespionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \nThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its \nterritory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the \nterritorial State itself\u201d.194 \nHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in \nthe due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts \namounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State \nactors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful \nacts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. \nThe International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle \napplies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the \ncyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target \nState.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the \nconduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations \np. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which \nmade the due diligence obligation come into play. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

What the International \nGroup of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding \nnon-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence \nprinciple is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to \naffect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One \nexample of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. \nSince non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if \nthe non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes \nthe target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company \npublishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence \nprinciple will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target \nState is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a \nprivate company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the \ndocuments itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious \nadverse consequences for the target State. \n \n4.5.3 Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about \nfault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to \nenvironmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The \nharm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could \npotentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental \nentities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations \nwhen the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences \nfor, other States. The criteria \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d was included in Rule 6 by \nanalogy from the content of the due diligence principle in international environmental \n \n197 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 36. \n198 Ibid. \n199 See for example Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it \nis clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, \nfor example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that \nthe conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \nStates also seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The \nNetherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle \napplies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently \nserious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends \non the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This \nis also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The \nInternational Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of \nserious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold \nof serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that \nare placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber \noperation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not \nmean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse \nconsequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due \ndiligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker \ngroup.

Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the \nharm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm \nmanifests.208 \n \n4.5.4 Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for \nactivities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the \nobligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over \na territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during \nmilitary occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over \ngovernment cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission \nnetwork on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard \nsovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure \nin diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \nThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the \ndue diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a \ndestructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located \nin State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures \nto put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212 \nIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the \ncyber infrastructure is located in State C. \nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due \ndiligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through \nwhich only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable. Although hesitantly, they \nconcluded that it did apply if the transit State had knowledge of the cyber operation, if \n \n207 Ibid. \n208 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 39. \n209 Ibid p. 32 \n210 Ibid. \n211 Ibid p. 33. \n212 Ibid p. 32. \n213 Ibid p. 33. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Bannelier-Christakis adds \nto this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by \nthe due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going \nto cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this \nattack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At \nthe same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for \nviolating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, \nbut also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had \nknowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same \nconclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be \nable to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they \ndo have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an \nobligation to do so. \n \n4.5.5 Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have \nknowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case \nmade it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was \ndependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before \nthe date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold \na State responsible for something it was not aware of. The Court further stated that \u201cit \ncannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its \nterritory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d about the \ncircumstances.220 In other words, States do not have an absolute knowledge of everything \nthat is happening on their territory.

The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State \nhaving actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber \noperation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about \nsuch a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had \nsuch knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive \nknowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in \nquestion, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still \napplies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to \ncertain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated \nthat Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include \nconstructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another \nissue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of \nfactors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \n\u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being \nused, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber \noperation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State \nto have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very \nclear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. \n223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226 Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This has already been made clear from the way \nit is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that \nit is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described \nas providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only \nprescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. \nIt is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law \nsince it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their \nbehavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it \ncould reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in \nenvironmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary \nHarm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It \nhas further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that \nthe principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \nWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the \ndue diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the \ncircumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also \nimply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber \noperation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for \nexample, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of \nbona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that \nStates only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe \nmeans at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already \nfrom the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of \nprevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11. \n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable \nto expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant \ncircumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been \nbreached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance \nwith the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are \nfeasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a \nright of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239 \nRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in \norder to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that \ndeveloping States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar \nmanner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have \nbreached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted \nto use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are \ntaken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. \nReasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be \nexpected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements \nof what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not \nbecome an unreasonable burden for States. \n \n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this \nquestion. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken \nreasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to \nhave violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting \nits cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some \nsort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he \nbreach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs \nwhen the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the \nmeans to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence \nobligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another \nState. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there \nare no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence \nvaries depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree \nof due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and \nhave already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to \nbe an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation \nof States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of \ntheir cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due \ndiligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no \nobligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not \nundisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does \nimply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to \nthe Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use \ndue diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, \nnotwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. \n245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 \nThe ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the \nBritish warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge \nof it. In the latter case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, the ICJ stated \nthat Uganda was responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance preventing violations of Human \nRights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied \nterritory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.248 Simply notifying the \ntarget State may not always be enough. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are \nrequired to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \nSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in \ncyberspace includes. The due diligence principle does not make a difference between a \nsituation in peacetime and during conflict. However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during \nconflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due \ndiligence continues to apply, nonetheless. \nFurthermore, the due diligence obligation is only concerned with ongoing \noperations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is \ncomplete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \nEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due \ndiligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require \ncertain specific measures in some circumstances.

In the Seabed Mining Advisory \nOpinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and \nthat it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological \nknowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been \ndescribed of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted \nto fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due \ndiligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method \nof assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is \nconfirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. \nIndeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact \nassessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the \noperations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is \nrequired of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle \nrequires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While \nenvironmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what \nthe content of the due diligence principle will be.  \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may \nultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, \nand regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are \nrequired to do. \n \n4.5.8 Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which \nto hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is \nespecially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 \nCyberspace is undeniably included in this. \nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for \nStates. The obligation varies depending on the context and the level of development of \nthe State. Due diligence must be seen in the light of the capabilities of the States \n \n254 Stockburger p. 248. \n255 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n256 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

If a burden put on a State is deemed \nto be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence \nobligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established \ncustomary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the \nprinciple in relation to cyber operations. In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great \naddition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of \nExperts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be \nin line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule \n6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field \nof cyberspace. \n4.6 Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, \nsome authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, \nStockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence \nobligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence \nprinciple to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also \nargues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially \naffect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is \nnot customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex \nferenda.260 \nThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore \nconsidered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be \nused to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \nDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. \nFor example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International \nHealth Regulations261 imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof \nall events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257.

Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a \nresponsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule \n22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, \ncountermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The \nregulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are \navoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is \nnot completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to \nprove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of \nthe territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. \nGranted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation \nemanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. \nHowever, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether \nthe territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary \nto trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing \ndegree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is \nrelatively high.266 \n \n \n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. \n263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the \ncountermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nprovides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justified in a due \ndiligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in \nState A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this \ncase, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to \ncontrol the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control \nits territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0.269 \nNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful \nomission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking \ncountermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. \nThe countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the \nseverity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \nThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the \ninternational context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take \nmeasures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in \nrelation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that \nfact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due \ndiligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, \nsince that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \nAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can \nbe either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \nIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of \ncountermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, \nin the field of cyberspace. 271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. \nIn its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due \ndiligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. \n269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the \nsame way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber \noperations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the \nanonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations \nto States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having \nto be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have \na responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international \nactivities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other \nStates. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be \nused also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered \napplicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a \nstatus as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, \ndoctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, \nwhich has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all \nareas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general \nprinciple of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace. That is the thesis \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, \nor at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not \napply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. \nStates may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but \nneither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due \ndiligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the \nstatements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent \nin order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to \nbe positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more \nreluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence \nobligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to \ncyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \nFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the \nprinciple is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber \noperations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has \nbeen stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. \nAdditionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only \nslightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established \nby the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the \nmalicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, \nmust affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the \nState. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could \nnot agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due \ndiligence principle, but there are still problems to solve.  \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of \nthe principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber \noperations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of \ninternational law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of \nthe due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between \ndifferent interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the \nproblem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary \nwith a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations. \n6.2 As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how \ninternational law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

States are heavily dependent on the use of \ncyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an \nincreasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, \nhave similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of \nproperty.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the \neconomic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially \ndangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations \nfall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This \nraises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can \ndeal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both \nregional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \nCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. \nFirst of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a \nsignificant level of anonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. \nAll of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State \nactors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute \nwhether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlow expressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace \nand that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that \ncyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is \nborderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that \ncyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs \nand Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure \nCyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), \nNational Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow. \n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber \noperations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible \noption. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, \nregulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject \nto international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the \napplication of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how \ninternational law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of \ninternational law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \nInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different \nfora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the \nregulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \non the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8 A Group of \nGovernmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to \nstrengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN \nGGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before \nfailing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \nCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is \nhappening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. \nAs an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a \ntraditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support \ncyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist \nin applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility \ngenerally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State. Attributing cyber acts \nto States is difficult because of the special features of cyberspace and because many of \n \n7 See for example Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 13 and Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the \nInternational Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3.

Therefore, it has been suggested that \nattribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \nHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of \nStates. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states \nthat it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary \ninternational law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States \nto not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that \nthe State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stop the \nattack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace \nor not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2 Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow \nknowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to \nactivities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as \nformulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed. \n1.3 Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal \nresponsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of \ninternational organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State \nresponsibility, but not relevant for the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in \norder to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle \napplies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the \nuse of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules \nabout use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of \nthe study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an \narmed attack.  However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed \n \n13 See Chapter 3.5 for a discussion about this. \n14 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n15 Compare Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Other consequences of State responsibility \nwill not be discussed. \nCyberspace is a technical area, but the technical aspects of cyber operations will be \ncovered only in order to understand the problems of cyber operations and how due \ndiligence works in relation to this. \nDue diligence is sometimes referred to with other names, for example the obligation of \nvigilance, the obligation of prevention, and the duty of prevention. I have decided to refer \nto it as simply due diligence, which is the terminology adopted in the Tallinn Manual \n2.0.16 \nWhile the examination of the applicability of the due diligence principle is the focus of \nthe study, the scope and the content of the principle will also be discussed in order to \nunderstand it. \n1.4 Method and material \n1.4.1 The dogmatic method and public international law \nTo examine the due diligence principle in cyberspace, I have used a dogmatic approach. \nThere are many different definitions of the dogmatic method, but the main feature is that \nit attempts to analyze what the established law is, and to interpret the content of the legal \nsources in question.17 At the same time, this is a study of public international law. Public \ninternational law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. \nIn international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all \nStates. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able \nto interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of \ninternational law are different from the sources of domestic law. \nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ19 contains the most widely recognized \nauthoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law.20 The article \nstates that  \n \n16 See Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31 for a \ndiscussion about the terminology. \n17 See Lehrberg p. 201 and Hjertstedt p. 167. \n18 Shaw p. 49. \n19 United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice (18 April 1946). \n20 Shaw p. 50. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long \nas the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of \nevery single State of the world. \nOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a \ncertain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so. This has \nbeen confirmed, for example, by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases32, where \nthe Court stated that \u201c[n]ot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but \nthey must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that \nthis practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it\u201d.33 \nIn some cases, it is rather difficult to point to a distinct line between treaty and custom. \nFor example, a treaty provision could establish the foundation of a rule which, together \nwith opinio juris, may lead to the formation of a binding customary rule for all States, not \nonly the ones party to the treaty.34 This was pointed out by the ICJ in the North Sea \nContinental Shelf cases where it was considered to be one of the established methods of \ncreating new customary rules.35 However, it is not just any provision that can constitute \ncustomary law.

One of the challenges \nwhen applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the \ncustomary rule. \n \n1.4.2 The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed \nthrough international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand \nthe principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding \ncyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually \nclassified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements \nregarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability \nof due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and \nopinio juris. \nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. \nThe few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due \ndiligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of \nenvironmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to \ndue diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary \nlaw. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence \nrule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement \nof the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nis not an official document or an official source of international law.

Since the articles are not a treaty, they are not binding on any States. \nHowever, the United Nations Assembly commended the articles to member States in \n2012 and they have also been repeatedly referred to by courts, tribunals, and other \ninternational bodies. \nFinally, academic writings, which have made a big contribution to establishing the \ncontent of due diligence in cyberspace, will be used. \n1.5 Outline of the thesis \nThe thesis will, in Chapter 2, introduce the concept of cyber operations. Cyberspace will \nbe defined, as will cyber operations. Thereafter, it will be discussed whether public \ninternational law is applicable in cyberspace. \nIn Chapter 3, State responsibility is discussed. It will be explained what it is and when \nStates can be held responsible for international acts.

The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, \nintegrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on \nthe territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \n\u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems \nare built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res \ncommunis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that \ncyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal \none.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory \nand involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may \nexercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be \ninternational in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or \nentities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \nThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d. In \nrelation to cyberspace, territory is to be understood as the territory connected to the \nphysical aspect of cyberspace.

Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \nIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication \nTechnologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is \nthat ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or \nsubsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or \ninformation\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, \nwireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the \nsource of a misuse or the target of such.53 \n2.2 What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \nAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber \nactivity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or \nemploys means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d. 55 Cyber operations are \nfurther defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through \ncyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. \nA cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether \noffensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused \nto describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO \nGlossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, \nnamely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to \ndisrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence \nprinciple in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A \nGlossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security \nStrategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. \n55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

A mere intrusion into a \ncomputer system is not included in the term cyber attack.59 Rather, it is to be considered \nas cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law.60 \nHowever, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of \ncyber attacks.61 Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other \nwords, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. \nFor the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content \nof the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as \nformulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which \nis unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \nWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will \nbe used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. \nthe State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose \nterritory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is \nlocated, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber \noperation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these \ncyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals \nwith ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt \nsoftware and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical \ninfrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential \nconsequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the \nmilitary command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail \nand aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, \nweapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64 \nCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is \nimportant to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. \n61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyberspace is \nborderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily \naccessible for many actors, including non-State actors. Because of the special character \nof cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public \ninternational law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not \nwithin any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most \ngenerally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing \nelse, if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless \nland. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts \nof acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal \nvoid, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security. \nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur \nin cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind \nthe cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more \nStates. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international \nlaw as usual. \nThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law \napplies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has \nbeen acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nfurther states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty \nis part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN \nCharter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \nFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct \ncyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in \ninternational law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and \nthis is true also for cyber operations.71 \nThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed \nsince it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace.

State responsibility is a central principle of public \ninternational law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The \nprinciple stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one \nState commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State \nresponsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of \nan international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and \nwho may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \nThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 \nAugust 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft \nArticles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly \nin a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, \nwhich is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77 \n3.2 The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State \nresponsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international \nresponsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, \nregardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. \nAccording to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). \n76 Shaw p. 568.

The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80  \nAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles \non State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of \nthat State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of \nits origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international \nobligation is.81 \nOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered \nby an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal \nliterature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective \nresponsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson \nholds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation \nincludes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of \nwhether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 \nestablished that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally \nwrongful act.88 \nAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled \nas an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached \nis owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the \ninternational community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must \nspecifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the \nposition of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further \nperformance of the obligation. \n \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87 Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles \non State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an \ninternationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. \nThis element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not \nthe one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of \nthe State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The \nrules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself.  \nThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to \nexercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under \ninternational law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes \ninstructions. \nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility \nis that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State \nunder international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the \ninstructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. \nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit \nwould in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of \nthe military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were \ncommitted\u201d.93 \n \n89 Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and \nthe State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

The main reason \nfor introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation \nto cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4 The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for \nestablishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of \ninternationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations \nproduce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been \ndescribed as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often \ndiscussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of \ninternational cyber law. \nAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important \nmatter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, \nidentifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution \nin cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \nFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This \nis not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to \nit. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the \ncomputer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address \nso that it is not trackable. Not only that, but if the actor uses a network modification \ntechnique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in \nfact is.97 \n \n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. \n96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Attribution \nattempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if \nthe location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the \nperson behind the act can be identified.98 \nFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established \nand the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus \nbetween the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find \na \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the \ninjury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to \nprevent genocide.101 \nTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber \noperation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several \ncomputers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated \nby different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber \noperations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further \nstates that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \nAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States \nresponsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the \nrisk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able \nto use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5 Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign \nand equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If \nthat happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State \nbreaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as \ncountermeasures. \n \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100 Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. \n103 Ibid p. 230. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In the \nGabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ stated that a countermeasure has to meet \ncertain conditions in order to be justifiable.104 First, the countermeasure must be taken in \nresponse to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed \nagainst that State.105 Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State \ncommitting the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation \nfor it.106 In the view of the Court, an important consideration is that the effects of a \ncountermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the \nrights in question.107 Furthermore, the Court stated that another condition for the \nlawfulness of a countermeasure is that its purpose must be to induce the wrongdoing State \nto comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must \ntherefore be reversible.108 \nCountermeasures are dealt with in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility. Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first \nparagraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State \nwhich is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to \ncomply with its obligations under the draft articles.

The first one is by \nattribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in \nprevious chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence \nprinciple. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the \ndue diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, \nmilitary responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the \nthreshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate.  \nThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber \noperations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more \ncommon with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of \ncyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are \ngenerally not able to be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, \nusually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have \ninternational responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent \nthe act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, \nnot the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence \nhave previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility. 112 \nDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the \ncontext and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle \nin Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, \nits development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in \nthe field of cyberspace. \n4.2 The history of due diligence \nAs has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that \ntheir territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State.

The principle \nof sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence \nis derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty \nwas interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other \nStates.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 \ninvolves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary \na duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular \ntheir right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right \nto exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there \nneeds to be a corresponding legal obligation.  \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on \nthe circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. \nThe articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other \nstandards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence \nor want of due diligence. Such standards vary from one context to another for \n \n113 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, First Report (7 \nMarch 2014) p. 2. \n114 Ibid. \n115 Ibid. \n116 SS Lotus (France v Turkey), 1927 PCIJ (Ser.

For example, in the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute \nbetween the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, \nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner \nas to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or \npersons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence.128 \nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. \nThere was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. \nInstead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international \nprinciple.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that \nthe obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal \nonly expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One \nmight claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to \nthe specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle \nof environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the \ndevelopment of due diligence in environmental law is examined. \nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case \nlaw. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle \noutside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel \ncase. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case tried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held \nAlbania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their \nomission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation \nnot to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle. Corfu \nChannel has been said to best articulate the general principle of due diligence.133 \nFurthermore, in its Advisory Opinion to the UN General Assembly on the Legality of \nthe Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons134, the ICJ stated that \u201c[t]he existence of the \ngeneral obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control \n \n129 Miller, Trail Smelter Arbitration para 7. \n130 Trail Smelter Arbitration, United States v.

The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that \nthe Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective \nmeasures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations \nor camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or \ntheir citizens.136 \nThere are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although \nthe term itself is at times absent. This is especially true for international treaty law.137 \nThere are exceptions, such as the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and \nCombatting Violence against Women138, which explicitly includes due diligence in article \n5. Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. \nNonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law. It is also \nparticularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of \nresponsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \nAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part \nof customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law \n(including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 \nThey explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its \ndesirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral \nstandards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact \nresult or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the \nmore general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time. Therefore, it is not \nsurprising that due diligence remains a prominent standard of influential law and that its \nuse has spread, and is still spreading, to other areas of international law besides \nenvironmental law. \n \n135 Ibid p. 242. \n136 UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000). \n137 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 6. \n138 Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic \nviolence, CETS No. 210 (11 May 2011). \n139 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, Second Report \n(July 2016) p. 2. \n140 Ibid p. 5. \n141 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Because \nof this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when \nassessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and \nscope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of \ninternational treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve \nthe marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all \nmeasures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so \nconducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. \nShaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally \nas the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due \ndiligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation \nprescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other \nrelevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the \nprevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. \nDue diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from \nHazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate \nmeasures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d. \nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization \nmeasures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that \nwill determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the \npresent articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended \nto guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to \ndo so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. \n143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous \nActivities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two \n(2001). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In this sense, it does not guarantee that \nthe harm would not occur.147 \nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of \nconduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The \nState simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills \nits due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS \nsimilarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable \nmeans at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not \nstated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating \nprevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a \nstricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. \nWhat is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness \nincluded in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its \nobligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, \nfor example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, \nor use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly \nexpressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. \nThe Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case \nconcerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the \nUnited States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States \nand a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the \nreference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a \nprivate company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, \nthe State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its \nterritory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \n\u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental \nstatement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter \nPulp Mills]. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, for example, to argue that \nthe Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle \nshould be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of \nenvironmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument \ndoes not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in \nenvironmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to \nthe specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in \nrelation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant \ntransboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to \ncontext.

In \nPulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general \ninternational law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk \nthat the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a \ntransboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental \nimpact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain \nActivities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent \nsignificant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural \nobligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to \nnotify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \nThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be \ndivided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary \nharm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an \nEIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, \nif there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with \nthe potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate \nmeasures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk \nascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State \ndetermines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult \nthe affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the \nobligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe \nJudgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State \nof origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been \nestablished.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one \ncircumstance.

At this \nmoment, there is no such conclusive State practice or opinio juris. On the contrary, several \nStates have expressed both that customary international law applies to cyberspace and \nthat due diligence is among these customary rules. \nFor example, the White house stated, in its International Strategy for Cyberspace \n(2011), that \u201c[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require \na reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international \nnorms obsolete.

Additionally, the UN GGE included in its 2015 report the \nrecommendation that \u201cStates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for \ninternationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u201d.182 \nAt the same time, however, those who do not believe due diligence to be applicable in \nthe context of cyber operations have used the UN GGE as an argument against its \napplicability.183 In their reports, the Experts stated that States \u201cshould\u201d observe the due \ndiligence principle, rather than that they \u201cmust\u201d.184 Nevertheless, according to the Tallinn \nManual 2.0, the GGE\u2019s statements do not \u201cdefinitively refute the existence of such a \nprinciple\u201d.185 \nWhile there is considerable evidence which points to the fact that due diligence should \nbe considered applicable in the cyber context, it is a fact that not all States have accepted \ndue diligence as customary law, especially not in cyberspace.186 States are reluctant to \ncredit the due diligence principle with a lex lata status. Considering that cyberspace still \nhas to be seen as a new area of international law, this is not surprising.

Considering the few statements that do exist, or have been made public \nabout due diligence, it is not enough to establish such State practice or opinio juris. \nAlthough it cannot be predicted whether State practice and opinio juris will confirm or \ndeny the applicability of due diligence to cyberspace, the argument of this thesis is that \nthe principle should be treated as applicable to cyberspace. This also follows the \nprerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of \ninternational law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is \nsuch a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the \narea of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context. It is my \nview that due diligence will be applicable, in one way or another, in cyberspace. The main \nquestion to be answered is what the content of the applicable principle will be. \n4.5 The scope of due diligence \n4.5.1 General notes about the scope \nRule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle in cyberspace: \nA State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or \ncyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber \noperations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences \nfor, other States.187 \nThe basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise \ndue diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not \nused to harm other States\u201d.188 The International Group of Experts have used the \ncommonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle \nin the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct \nexpected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.189 \nThe due diligence principle applies to all third party cyber operations. It does not matter \nif the cyber operation is carried out by a private person, a corporation, a non-State actor, \nor a State.190 \n \n187 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n188 Ibid. \n189 Ibid. \n190 Ibid p. 32. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It \nwill cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the \nprinciple. \n \n4.5.2 Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to \namount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it \nwould not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation \nif the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example \nregarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using \ncyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to \nterminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber \nespionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \nThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its \nterritory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the \nterritorial State itself\u201d.194 \nHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in \nthe due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts \namounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State \nactors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful \nacts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. \nThe International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle \napplies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the \ncyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target \nState.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the \nconduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations \np. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which \nmade the due diligence obligation come into play. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

What the International \nGroup of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding \nnon-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence \nprinciple is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to \naffect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One \nexample of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. \nSince non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if \nthe non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes \nthe target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company \npublishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence \nprinciple will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target \nState is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a \nprivate company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the \ndocuments itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious \nadverse consequences for the target State. \n \n4.5.3 Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about \nfault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to \nenvironmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The \nharm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could \npotentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental \nentities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations \nwhen the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences \nfor, other States. The criteria \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d was included in Rule 6 by \nanalogy from the content of the due diligence principle in international environmental \n \n197 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 36. \n198 Ibid. \n199 See for example Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it \nis clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, \nfor example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that \nthe conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \nStates also seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The \nNetherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle \napplies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently \nserious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends \non the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This \nis also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The \nInternational Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of \nserious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold \nof serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that \nare placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber \noperation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not \nmean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse \nconsequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due \ndiligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker \ngroup. The International Group of Experts were split on how to treat this issue. While a \nfew suggested that it would be a violation, it was pointed out by the majority that such a \nview would put the due diligence obligation in the perspective of the target State, rather \nthan the territorial States.

Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the \nharm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm \nmanifests.208 \n \n4.5.4 Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for \nactivities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the \nobligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over \na territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during \nmilitary occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over \ngovernment cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission \nnetwork on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard \nsovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure \nin diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \nThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the \ndue diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a \ndestructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located \nin State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures \nto put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212 \nIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the \ncyber infrastructure is located in State C. \nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due \ndiligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through \nwhich only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable. Although hesitantly, they \nconcluded that it did apply if the transit State had knowledge of the cyber operation, if \n \n207 Ibid. \n208 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 39. \n209 Ibid p. 32 \n210 Ibid. \n211 Ibid p. 33. \n212 Ibid p. 32. \n213 Ibid p. 33. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Bannelier-Christakis adds \nto this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by \nthe due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going \nto cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this \nattack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At \nthe same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for \nviolating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, \nbut also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had \nknowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same \nconclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be \nable to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they \ndo have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an \nobligation to do so. \n \n4.5.5 Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have \nknowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case \nmade it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was \ndependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before \nthe date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold \na State responsible for something it was not aware of. The Court further stated that \u201cit \ncannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its \nterritory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d about the \ncircumstances.220 In other words, States do not have an absolute knowledge of everything \nthat is happening on their territory. However, it may be reasonable to ask of a State to \n\u201cuse best effort to gain knowledge of activity within its territory or jurisdiction\u201d.221 \n \n214 Bannelier-Christakis p. 6. \n215 Ibid. \n216 Ibid. \n217 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. \n218 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n219 Corfu Channel p. 22. \n220 Ibid p. 18. \n221 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State \nhaving actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber \noperation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about \nsuch a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had \nsuch knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive \nknowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in \nquestion, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still \napplies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to \ncertain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated \nthat Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include \nconstructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another \nissue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of \nfactors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \n\u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being \nused, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber \noperation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State \nto have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very \nclear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. \n223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226 Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This has already been made clear from the way \nit is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that \nit is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described \nas providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only \nprescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. \nIt is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law \nsince it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their \nbehavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it \ncould reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in \nenvironmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary \nHarm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It \nhas further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that \nthe principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \nWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the \ndue diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the \ncircumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also \nimply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber \noperation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for \nexample, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of \nbona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that \nStates only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe \nmeans at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already \nfrom the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of \nprevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11. \n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable \nto expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant \ncircumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been \nbreached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance \nwith the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are \nfeasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a \nright of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239 \nRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in \norder to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that \ndeveloping States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar \nmanner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have \nbreached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted \nto use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are \ntaken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. \nReasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be \nexpected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements \nof what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not \nbecome an unreasonable burden for States. \n \n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this \nquestion. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken \nreasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to \nhave violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting \nits cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some \nsort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he \nbreach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs \nwhen the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the \nmeans to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence \nobligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another \nState. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there \nare no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence \nvaries depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree \nof due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and \nhave already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to \nbe an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation \nof States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of \ntheir cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due \ndiligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no \nobligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not \nundisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does \nimply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to \nthe Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use \ndue diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, \nnotwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. \n245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 \nThe ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the \nBritish warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge \nof it.

According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are \nrequired to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \nSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in \ncyberspace includes.

However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during \nconflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due \ndiligence continues to apply, nonetheless. \nFurthermore, the due diligence obligation is only concerned with ongoing \noperations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is \ncomplete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \nEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due \ndiligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require \ncertain specific measures in some circumstances.

In the Seabed Mining Advisory \nOpinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and \nthat it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological \nknowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been \ndescribed of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted \nto fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due \ndiligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method \nof assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is \nconfirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. \nIndeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact \nassessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the \noperations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is \nrequired of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle \nrequires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While \nenvironmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what \nthe content of the due diligence principle will be.  \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may \nultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, \nand regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are \nrequired to do. \n \n4.5.8 Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which \nto hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is \nespecially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 \nCyberspace is undeniably included in this. \nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for \nStates. The obligation varies depending on the context and the level of development of \nthe State. Due diligence must be seen in the light of the capabilities of the States \n \n254 Stockburger p. 248. \n255 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n256 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

If a burden put on a State is deemed \nto be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence \nobligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established \ncustomary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the \nprinciple in relation to cyber operations. In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great \naddition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of \nExperts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be \nin line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule \n6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field \nof cyberspace. \n4.6 Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, \nsome authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, \nStockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence \nobligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence \nprinciple to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also \nargues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially \naffect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is \nnot customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex \nferenda.260 \nThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore \nconsidered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be \nused to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \nDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. \nFor example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International \nHealth Regulations261 imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof \nall events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257.

Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a \nresponsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule \n22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, \ncountermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The \nregulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are \navoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is \nnot completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to \nprove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of \nthe territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. \nGranted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation \nemanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. \nHowever, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether \nthe territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary \nto trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing \ndegree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is \nrelatively high.266 \n \n \n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. \n263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the \ncountermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nprovides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justified in a due \ndiligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in \nState A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this \ncase, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to \ncontrol the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control \nits territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0.269 \nNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful \nomission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking \ncountermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. \nThe countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the \nseverity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \nThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the \ninternational context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take \nmeasures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in \nrelation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that \nfact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due \ndiligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, \nsince that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \nAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can \nbe either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \nIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of \ncountermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, \nin the field of cyberspace. 271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. \nIn its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due \ndiligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. \n269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the \nsame way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber \noperations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the \nanonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations \nto States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having \nto be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have \na responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international \nactivities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other \nStates. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be \nused also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered \napplicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a \nstatus as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, \ndoctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, \nwhich has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all \nareas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general \nprinciple of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace. That is the thesis \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, \nor at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not \napply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. \nStates may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but \nneither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due \ndiligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the \nstatements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent \nin order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to \nbe positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more \nreluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence \nobligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to \ncyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \nFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the \nprinciple is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber \noperations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has \nbeen stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. \nAdditionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only \nslightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established \nby the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the \nmalicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, \nmust affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the \nState. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could \nnot agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due \ndiligence principle, but there are still problems to solve.  \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of \nthe principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber \noperations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of \ninternational law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of \nthe due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between \ndifferent interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the \nproblem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary \nwith a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations. \n6.2 As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how \ninternational law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

States are heavily dependent on the use of \ncyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an \nincreasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, \nhave similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of \nproperty.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the \neconomic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially \ndangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations \nfall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This \nraises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can \ndeal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both \nregional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \nCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. \nFirst of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a \nsignificant level of anonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. \nAll of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State \nactors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute \nwhether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlow expressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace \nand that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that \ncyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is \nborderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that \ncyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs \nand Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure \nCyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), \nNational Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow. \n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber \noperations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible \noption. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, \nregulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject \nto international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the \napplication of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how \ninternational law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of \ninternational law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \nInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different \nfora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the \nregulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \non the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8 A Group of \nGovernmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to \nstrengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN \nGGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before \nfailing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \nCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is \nhappening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. \nAs an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a \ntraditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support \ncyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist \nin applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility.

Therefore, it has been suggested that \nattribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \nHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of \nStates. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states \nthat it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary \ninternational law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States \nto not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that \nthe State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stop the \nattack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace \nor not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2 Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow \nknowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to \nactivities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as \nformulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed. \n1.3 Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal \nresponsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of \ninternational organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State \nresponsibility, but not relevant for the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in \norder to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle \napplies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the \nuse of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules \nabout use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of \nthe study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an \narmed attack.  However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed \n \n13 See Chapter 3.5 for a discussion about this. \n14 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n15 Compare Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Public \ninternational law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. \nIn international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all \nStates. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able \nto interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way.

However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long \nas the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of \nevery single State of the world. \nOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a \ncertain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so. This has \nbeen confirmed, for example, by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases32, where \nthe Court stated that \u201c[n]ot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but \nthey must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that \nthis practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it\u201d.33 \nIn some cases, it is rather difficult to point to a distinct line between treaty and custom. \nFor example, a treaty provision could establish the foundation of a rule which, together \nwith opinio juris, may lead to the formation of a binding customary rule for all States, not \nonly the ones party to the treaty.34 This was pointed out by the ICJ in the North Sea \nContinental Shelf cases where it was considered to be one of the established methods of \ncreating new customary rules.35 However, it is not just any provision that can constitute \ncustomary law.

One of the challenges \nwhen applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the \ncustomary rule. \n \n1.4.2 The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed \nthrough international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand \nthe principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding \ncyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually \nclassified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements \nregarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability \nof due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and \nopinio juris. \nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. \nThe few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due \ndiligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of \nenvironmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to \ndue diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary \nlaw. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence \nrule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement \nof the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nis not an official document or an official source of international law.

The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, \nintegrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on \nthe territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \n\u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems \nare built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res \ncommunis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that \ncyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal \none.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory \nand involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may \nexercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be \ninternational in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or \nentities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \nThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d. In \nrelation to cyberspace, territory is to be understood as the territory connected to the \nphysical aspect of cyberspace.

Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \nIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication \nTechnologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is \nthat ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or \nsubsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or \ninformation\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, \nwireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the \nsource of a misuse or the target of such.53 \n2.2 What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \nAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber \nactivity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or \nemploys means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d. 55 Cyber operations are \nfurther defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through \ncyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. \nA cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether \noffensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused \nto describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO \nGlossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, \nnamely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to \ndisrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence \nprinciple in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A \nGlossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security \nStrategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. \n55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

A mere intrusion into a \ncomputer system is not included in the term cyber attack.59 Rather, it is to be considered \nas cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law.60 \nHowever, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of \ncyber attacks.61 Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other \nwords, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. \nFor the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content \nof the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as \nformulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which \nis unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \nWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will \nbe used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. \nthe State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose \nterritory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is \nlocated, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber \noperation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these \ncyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals \nwith ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt \nsoftware and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical \ninfrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential \nconsequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the \nmilitary command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail \nand aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, \nweapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64 \nCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is \nimportant to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. \n61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyberspace is \nborderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily \naccessible for many actors, including non-State actors. Because of the special character \nof cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public \ninternational law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not \nwithin any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most \ngenerally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing \nelse, if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless \nland. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts \nof acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal \nvoid, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security. \nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur \nin cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind \nthe cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more \nStates. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international \nlaw as usual. \nThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law \napplies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has \nbeen acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nfurther states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty \nis part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN \nCharter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \nFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct \ncyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in \ninternational law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and \nthis is true also for cyber operations.71 \nThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed \nsince it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace.

State responsibility is a central principle of public \ninternational law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The \nprinciple stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one \nState commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State \nresponsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of \nan international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and \nwho may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \nThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 \nAugust 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft \nArticles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly \nin a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, \nwhich is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77 \n3.2 The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State \nresponsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international \nresponsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, \nregardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. \nAccording to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). \n76 Shaw p. 568.

The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80  \nAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles \non State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of \nthat State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of \nits origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international \nobligation is.81 \nOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered \nby an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal \nliterature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective \nresponsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson \nholds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation \nincludes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of \nwhether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 \nestablished that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally \nwrongful act.88 \nAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled \nas an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached \nis owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the \ninternational community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must \nspecifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the \nposition of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further \nperformance of the obligation. \n \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87 Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles \non State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an \ninternationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. \nThis element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not \nthe one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of \nthe State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The \nrules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself.  \nThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to \nexercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under \ninternational law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes \ninstructions. \nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility \nis that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State \nunder international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the \ninstructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. \nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit \nwould in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of \nthe military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were \ncommitted\u201d.93 \n \n89 Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and \nthe State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

The main reason \nfor introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation \nto cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4 The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for \nestablishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of \ninternationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations \nproduce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been \ndescribed as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often \ndiscussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of \ninternational cyber law. \nAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important \nmatter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, \nidentifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution \nin cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \nFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This \nis not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to \nit. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the \ncomputer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address \nso that it is not trackable. Not only that, but if the actor uses a network modification \ntechnique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in \nfact is.97 \n \n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. \n96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Focus on capturing paragraphs that represent the author's core arguments and ideas.\n\ntext: 27 \n \nThe second part of the problem, which is perhaps even more daunting, is that it is \nnecessary to identify the person, or the group, operating the computer. Attribution \nattempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if \nthe location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the \nperson behind the act can be identified.98 \nFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established \nand the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus \nbetween the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find \na \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the \ninjury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to \nprevent genocide.101 \nTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber \noperation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several \ncomputers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated \nby different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber \noperations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further \nstates that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \nAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States \nresponsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the \nrisk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able \nto use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5 Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign \nand equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If \nthat happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State \nbreaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as \ncountermeasures. \n \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100 Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. \n103 Ibid p. 230. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In the \nGabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ stated that a countermeasure has to meet \ncertain conditions in order to be justifiable.104 First, the countermeasure must be taken in \nresponse to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed \nagainst that State.105 Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State \ncommitting the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation \nfor it.106 In the view of the Court, an important consideration is that the effects of a \ncountermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the \nrights in question.107 Furthermore, the Court stated that another condition for the \nlawfulness of a countermeasure is that its purpose must be to induce the wrongdoing State \nto comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must \ntherefore be reversible.108 \nCountermeasures are dealt with in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility. Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first \nparagraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State \nwhich is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to \ncomply with its obligations under the draft articles.

Obligations not affected by countermeasures \nare covered in Article 50 which makes it clear that countermeasures shall not affect the \nobligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied by the UN Charter109, \nobligations for the protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of a humanitarian \ncharacter prohibiting reprisals and other obligations under peremptory norms of general \ninternational law. \nCountermeasures in relation to the due diligence principle will be further discussed in \nChapter 5. \n \n \n104 Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, p. 7, para. 83. \n105 Ibid. \n106 Ibid. \n107 Ibid para. 84. \n108 Ibid para. 87. \n109 Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one is by \nattribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in \nprevious chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence \nprinciple. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the \ndue diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, \nmilitary responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the \nthreshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate.  \nThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber \noperations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more \ncommon with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of \ncyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are \ngenerally not able to be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, \nusually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have \ninternational responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent \nthe act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, \nnot the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence \nhave previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility. 112 \nDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the \ncontext and in relation to another specific international norm.

The principle \nof sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence \nis derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty \nwas interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other \nStates.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 \ninvolves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary \na duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular \ntheir right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right \nto exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there \nneeds to be a corresponding legal obligation.  \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on \nthe circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. \nThe articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other \nstandards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence \nor want of due diligence.

For example, in the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute \nbetween the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, \nno State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner \nas to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or \npersons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence.128 \nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. \nThere was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. \nInstead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international \nprinciple.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that \nthe obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal \nonly expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One \nmight claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to \nthe specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle \nof environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the \ndevelopment of due diligence in environmental law is examined. \nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case \nlaw. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle \noutside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel \ncase. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case tried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held \nAlbania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their \nomission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation \nnot to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other \nStates\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle.

The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that \nthe Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective \nmeasures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations \nor camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or \ntheir citizens.136 \nThere are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although \nthe term itself is at times absent.

Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. \nNonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law. It is also \nparticularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of \nresponsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \nAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part \nof customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law \n(including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 \nThey explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its \ndesirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral \nstandards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact \nresult or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the \nmore general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time.

Because \nof this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when \nassessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and \nscope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of \ninternational treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve \nthe marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all \nmeasures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so \nconducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. \nShaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally \nas the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due \ndiligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation \nprescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other \nrelevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the \nprevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. \nDue diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from \nHazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate \nmeasures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d. \nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization \nmeasures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that \nwill determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the \npresent articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended \nto guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to \ndo so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. \n143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous \nActivities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two \n(2001). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In this sense, it does not guarantee that \nthe harm would not occur.147 \nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of \nconduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The \nState simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills \nits due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS \nsimilarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable \nmeans at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not \nstated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating \nprevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a \nstricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. \nWhat is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness \nincluded in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its \nobligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, \nfor example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, \nor use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly \nexpressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. \nThe Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case \nconcerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the \nUnited States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States \nand a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the \nreference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a \nprivate company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, \nthe State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its \nterritory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \n\u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental \nstatement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter \nPulp Mills]. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, for example, to argue that \nthe Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle \nshould be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of \nenvironmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument \ndoes not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the \nTrail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in \nenvironmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to \nthe specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in \nrelation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant \ntransboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to \ncontext. There is not one standard of due diligence which applies to all primary rules.152 \nThis was confirmed by the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion.153 The Seabed Mining \nAdvisory Opinion (2011)154 concerned the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga \nwho both put forward applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the \narea reserved for the conduct of activities by the Seabed Mining Authority.

In \nPulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general \ninternational law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk \nthat the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a \ntransboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental \nimpact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain \nActivities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent \nsignificant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural \nobligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to \nnotify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \nThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be \ndivided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary \nharm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an \nEIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, \nif there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with \nthe potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate \nmeasures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk \nascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State \ndetermines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult \nthe affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the \nobligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe \nJudgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State \nof origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been \nestablished.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one \ncircumstance.

Considering the few statements that do exist, or have been made public \nabout due diligence, it is not enough to establish such State practice or opinio juris. \nAlthough it cannot be predicted whether State practice and opinio juris will confirm or \ndeny the applicability of due diligence to cyberspace, the argument of this thesis is that \nthe principle should be treated as applicable to cyberspace. This also follows the \nprerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of \ninternational law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is \nsuch a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the \narea of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context.

In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It \nwill cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the \nprinciple. \n \n4.5.2 Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to \namount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it \nwould not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation \nif the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example \nregarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using \ncyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to \nterminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber \nespionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \nThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its \nterritory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the \nterritorial State itself\u201d.194 \nHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in \nthe due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts \namounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State \nactors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful \nacts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. \nThe International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle \napplies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the \ncyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target \nState.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the \nconduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations \np. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which \nmade the due diligence obligation come into play. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

What the International \nGroup of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding \nnon-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence \nprinciple is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to \naffect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One \nexample of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. \nSince non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if \nthe non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes \nthe target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in \nquestion. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company \npublishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence \nprinciple will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target \nState is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a \nprivate company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the \ndocuments itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious \nadverse consequences for the target State. \n \n4.5.3 Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about \nfault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to \nenvironmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The \nharm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could \npotentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental \nentities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations \nwhen the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences \nfor, other States.

The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it \nis clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, \nfor example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that \nthe conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \nStates also seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The \nNetherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle \napplies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently \nserious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends \non the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This \nis also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The \nInternational Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of \nserious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold \nof serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that \nare placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber \noperation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not \nmean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse \nconsequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due \ndiligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker \ngroup. The International Group of Experts were split on how to treat this issue. While a \nfew suggested that it would be a violation, it was pointed out by the majority that such a \nview would put the due diligence obligation in the perspective of the target State, rather \nthan the territorial States.

Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the \nharm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm \nmanifests.208 \n \n4.5.4 Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for \nactivities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the \nobligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over \na territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during \nmilitary occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over \ngovernment cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission \nnetwork on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard \nsovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure \nin diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \nThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the \ndue diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a \ndestructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located \nin State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures \nto put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212 \nIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the \ncyber infrastructure is located in State C. \nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due \ndiligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through \nwhich only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable.

Bannelier-Christakis adds \nto this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by \nthe due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going \nto cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this \nattack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At \nthe same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for \nviolating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, \nbut also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had \nknowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same \nconclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be \nable to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they \ndo have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an \nobligation to do so. \n \n4.5.5 Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have \nknowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case \nmade it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was \ndependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before \nthe date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold \na State responsible for something it was not aware of.

The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State \nhaving actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber \noperation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about \nsuch a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had \nsuch knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The \nInternational Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive \nknowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in \nquestion, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still \napplies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to \ncertain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated \nthat Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include \nconstructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another \nissue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of \nfactors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \n\u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being \nused, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber \noperation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State \nto have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very \nclear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. \n223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226 Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This has already been made clear from the way \nit is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that \nit is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described \nas providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only \nprescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. \nIt is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law \nsince it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their \nbehavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it \ncould reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in \nenvironmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary \nHarm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It \nhas further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that \nthe principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \nWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the \ndue diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the \ncircumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also \nimply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber \noperation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for \nexample, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of \nbona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that \nStates only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe \nmeans at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already \nfrom the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of \nprevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11. \n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable \nto expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant \ncircumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been \nbreached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance \nwith the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are \nfeasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a \nright of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239 \nRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in \norder to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that \ndeveloping States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar \nmanner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have \nbreached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted \nto use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are \ntaken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. \nReasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be \nexpected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements \nof what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not \nbecome an unreasonable burden for States. \n \n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. \n239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this \nquestion. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken \nreasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to \nhave violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting \nits cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some \nsort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he \nbreach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs \nwhen the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the \nmeans to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence \nobligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another \nState. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there \nare no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence \nvaries depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree \nof due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and \nhave already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to \nbe an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation \nof States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of \ntheir cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due \ndiligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no \nobligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not \nundisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does \nimply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to \nthe Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use \ndue diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, \nnotwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. \n245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 \nThe ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the \nBritish warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge \nof it. In the latter case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, the ICJ stated \nthat Uganda was responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance preventing violations of Human \nRights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied \nterritory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.248 Simply notifying the \ntarget State may not always be enough. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are \nrequired to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \nSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in \ncyberspace includes. The due diligence principle does not make a difference between a \nsituation in peacetime and during conflict. However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during \nconflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due \ndiligence continues to apply, nonetheless. \nFurthermore, the due diligence obligation is only concerned with ongoing \noperations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is \ncomplete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \nEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due \ndiligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require \ncertain specific measures in some circumstances.

In the Seabed Mining Advisory \nOpinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and \nthat it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological \nknowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been \ndescribed of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted \nto fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due \ndiligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method \nof assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is \nconfirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. \nIndeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact \nassessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the \noperations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is \nrequired of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle \nrequires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While \nenvironmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what \nthe content of the due diligence principle will be.  \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may \nultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, \nand regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are \nrequired to do. \n \n4.5.8 Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which \nto hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is \nespecially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 \nCyberspace is undeniably included in this. \nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for \nStates.

If a burden put on a State is deemed \nto be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence \nobligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established \ncustomary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the \nprinciple in relation to cyber operations. In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great \naddition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of \nExperts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be \nin line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule \n6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field \nof cyberspace. \n4.6 Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, \nsome authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, \nStockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence \nobligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence \nprinciple to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also \nargues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially \naffect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is \nnot customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex \nferenda.260 \nThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore \nconsidered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be \nused to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \nDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. \nFor example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International \nHealth Regulations261 imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof \nall events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257.

Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a \nresponsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule \n22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, \ncountermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The \nregulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State \nResponsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are \navoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is \nnot completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to \nprove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of \nthe territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. \nGranted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation \nemanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. \nHowever, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether \nthe territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary \nto trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing \ndegree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is \nrelatively high.266 \n \n \n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. \n263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the \ncountermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 \nprovides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justified in a due \ndiligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in \nState A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this \ncase, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to \ncontrol the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control \nits territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the \nTallinn Manual 2.0.269 \nNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful \nomission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking \ncountermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. \nThe countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the \nseverity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \nThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the \ninternational context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take \nmeasures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in \nrelation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that \nfact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due \ndiligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, \nsince that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \nAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can \nbe either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \nIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of \ncountermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, \nin the field of cyberspace. 271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. \nIn its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due \ndiligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. \n269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the \nsame way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber \noperations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the \nanonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations \nto States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having \nto be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have \na responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international \nactivities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other \nStates. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be \nused also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered \napplicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a \nstatus as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, \ndoctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, \nwhich has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all \nareas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general \nprinciple of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace. That is the thesis \nof the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, \nor at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not \napply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. \nStates may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but \nneither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due \ndiligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the \nstatements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent \nin order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to \nbe positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more \nreluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence \nobligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to \ncyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \nFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the \nprinciple is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber \noperations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has \nbeen stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. \nAdditionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only \nslightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established \nby the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the \nmalicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, \nmust affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the \nState. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could \nnot agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due \ndiligence principle, but there are still problems to solve.  \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of \nthe principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber \noperations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of \ninternational law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of \nthe due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between \ndifferent interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the \nproblem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary \nwith a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations. \n6.2 As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-\nGeneral to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how \ninternational law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Two critical incidents had previously \ntriggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form \narmed attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive \ncomputer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. The second incident happened in 2008, during \nthe Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar \nto those suffered by Estonia in the previous year. Furthermore, on June 21, 2016, the central banks \nof Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist \nhacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. \nThe previous incidents have created, once again, public questioning if the rules on the use of force \nand the right of self-defense established in the United Nations Charter are sufficient and efficient \nto address these new forms of attacks.   \nKey words: Self-defense, United Nations, Pre-emptive Self-defense, non-state actors, cyber-\nattacks \nResumen: Los \u00faltimos ataques de la coalici\u00f3n liderada por Estados Unidos en contra de ISIS en Siria plantearon \nla cuesti\u00f3n de si los Estados pueden usar la autodefensa contra agentes-no-estatales.

Introduction  \n \nThis essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles \n2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts \nin the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \nNations Charter \n \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The right to self-defense \n \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right \nof individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United \nNations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace \nand security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions \nhave created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the \nUnited Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter \nand rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state \nactors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions \nof the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address \nthat the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to \naddress current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, \nwhether they come from state or non-state actors.  \n  \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n10/19 \n \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law.

However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on \nwho the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the \nattacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary \ninternational rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to \naddress this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules \nfor a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right \nto self-defense. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. \nThis is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced \nthe necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.   \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application \nof the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state \nactors and armed attack have changed.

Two critical incidents had previously \ntriggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form \narmed attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive \ncomputer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. The second incident happened in 2008, during \nthe Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar \nto those suffered by Estonia in the previous year. Furthermore, on June 21, 2016, the central banks \nof Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist \nhacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. \nThe previous incidents have created, once again, public questioning if the rules on the use of force \nand the right of self-defense established in the United Nations Charter are sufficient and efficient \nto address these new forms of attacks.   \nKey words: Self-defense, United Nations, Pre-emptive Self-defense, non-state actors, cyber-\nattacks \nResumen: Los \u00faltimos ataques de la coalici\u00f3n liderada por Estados Unidos en contra de ISIS en Siria plantearon \nla cuesti\u00f3n de si los Estados pueden usar la autodefensa contra agentes-no-estatales.

Introduction  \n \nThis essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles \n2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts \nin the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \nNations Charter \n \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another. Nevertheless, \n                                                          \n \n11  United Nations, \u201cCharter of the United Nations.\" \n12  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628. \n13  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628. \n14  Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. the United States of America), \n1981 I.C.J., 14 ICJ Reports 1986 (International Court of Justice 1986). \n15  Andrew Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, Queensland University of Technology \nLaw & Justice Journal 4, n\u00b0 2 (2004): 3.   \n16  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions \nhave created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the \nUnited Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter \nand rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state \nactors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions \nof the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address \nthat the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to \naddress current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, \nwhether they come from state or non-state actors.  \n  \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n12/19 \n \n6. Why are the rules of the use of force outdated? The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law.

However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on \nwho the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the \nattacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary \ninternational rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to \naddress this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules \nfor a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right \nto self-defense. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. \nThis is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced \nthe necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.   \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application \nof the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state \nactors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states \nbut also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, \nthe traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and \ntechnological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those \ntraditionally used. This has led to creating rules for attribution, to determine international \n                                                          \n \n61  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 51. \n62  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, 26. \n63  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, 26. \n64  Hidayat Setiaji, \u201cIndonesia, South Korea Central Bank Websites Hit by Cyber Attacks.

Two critical incidents had previously \ntriggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form \narmed attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive \ncomputer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. The second incident happened in 2008, during \nthe Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar \nto those suffered by Estonia in the previous year. Furthermore, on June 21, 2016, the central banks \nof Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist \nhacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. \nThe previous incidents have created, once again, public questioning if the rules on the use of force \nand the right of self-defense established in the United Nations Charter are sufficient and efficient \nto address these new forms of attacks.   \nKey words: Self-defense, United Nations, Pre-emptive Self-defense, non-state actors, cyber-\nattacks \nResumen: Los \u00faltimos ataques de la coalici\u00f3n liderada por Estados Unidos en contra de ISIS en Siria plantearon \nla cuesti\u00f3n de si los Estados pueden usar la autodefensa contra agentes-no-estatales. Dos incidentes cr\u00edticos ya hab\u00edan \nprovocado la discusi\u00f3n sobre la importancia y las consecuencias de los ataques cibern\u00e9ticos como una nueva forma de \nataques armados.

Introduction  \n \nThis essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles \n2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts \nin the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \nNations Charter \n \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The right to self-defense \n \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right \nof individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United \nNations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace \nand security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors.

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n10/19 \n \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists \nin the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose \nregulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on \nwho the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the \nattacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary \ninternational rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to \naddress this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules \nfor a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right \nto self-defense. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. \nThis is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced \nthe necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.   \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application \nof the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state \nactors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states \nbut also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, \nthe traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and \ntechnological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those \ntraditionally used.

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict.

Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. \nConflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law.

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the rules that are applicable to No-international \narmed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, \nwithout giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict.  \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional \nProtocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at \nthe international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. \nThe matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of \nconventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at \nan international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts \nat the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict  \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times. Conflicts \noccur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed \nconflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConvention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable \nto the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the \nstate party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but \ninvolves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-\ninternational Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both \nthe State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. \nRecognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the \ninsurgent group; \n\uf0b7 \nThose territories that are occupied \n\uf0b7 \nEstablished a government that exercised sovereign rights over the territory it \noccupied. \n\uf0b7 \nComplied with the laws and customs of war during hostilities with the State. \n(Bartels, 2009)  \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. \nnon-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and \nmilitary forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups.

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating \ncolonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise \nof their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict \nbetween two or more states. \n2. non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or \nif it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency \nbetween civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian \nobjects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \nPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian \npopulation are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and \nsuffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to \nthe principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military \nnecessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and \nare not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed \nconflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities \n(Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, \nnecessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is \nbased on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance \nthe expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is \nbest described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of \nmilitary force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of \nIHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons \nwho are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to \nsafeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured \ncivilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' \nAdditional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures \nthat persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a \nconflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military \nobjects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians \n(Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\". When it comes to applying IHL principles to the area of \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military \ncyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Belligerents would also have to take all \nnecessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-\nattacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated \nand providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result \nof an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be \nheld responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. \nTo put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed \nconflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations \n(Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that \naim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian \ngroups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique \nevaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare. \nKeywords:  \nAccountability,  \nConservative \nCritique \nCyber Warfare,  \nInternational \nHumanitarian Law,  \nProportionality \n*Corresponding \nAuthor:  \n \n \nsakambohadv@\ngmail.com \nIntroduction \nMore than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks \nthroughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware. Cyber Warfare is a fight between two \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. \nConflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI \nmight entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This \ncould be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer \nRobots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. \nIHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely \nto employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about \nweaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). \nThe following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant \non IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and \ncomputer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military \noperations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, \nand energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone \ngovernments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' \ninfrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most \nscholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the rules that are applicable to No-international \narmed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, \nwithout giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict.  \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional \nProtocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at \nthe international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. \nThe matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of \nconventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at \nan international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts \nat the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict  \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times.

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating \ncolonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise \nof their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict \nbetween two or more states. \n2. non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or \nif it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency \nbetween civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian \nobjects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \nPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian \npopulation are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and \nsuffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to \nthe principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL.

When there is a situation of an armed \nconflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities \n(Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, \nnecessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is \nbased on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance \nthe expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the \nequation, military necessity is the other.  \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is \nnecessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not \notherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not \nwithdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, \nand may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they \nare or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more \nrestrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always \nemploying restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions \nmay be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is \nessential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's \nmilitary foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its \nprimary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is \nbest described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of \nmilitary force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of \nIHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons \nwho are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to \nsafeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured \ncivilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' \nAdditional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures \nthat persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a \nconflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military \nobjects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians \n(Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\".

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military \ncyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Belligerents would also have to take all \nnecessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-\nattacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated \nand providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result \nof an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be \nheld responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. \nTo put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed \nconflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations \n(Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that \naim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian \ngroups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique \nevaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare. \nKeywords:  \nAccountability,  \nConservative \nCritique \nCyber Warfare,  \nInternational \nHumanitarian Law,  \nProportionality \n*Corresponding \nAuthor:  \n \n \nsakambohadv@\ngmail.com \nIntroduction \nMore than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks \nthroughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. \nConflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI \nmight entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This \ncould be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer \nRobots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. \nIHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely \nto employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about \nweaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). \nThe following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant \non IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and \ncomputer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military \noperations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, \nand energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone \ngovernments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' \ninfrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most \nscholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence.

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the rules that are applicable to No-international \narmed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, \nwithout giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict.  \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional \nProtocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at \nthe international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. \nThe matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of \nconventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at \nan international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts \nat the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict  \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times. Conflicts \noccur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed \nconflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConvention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable \nto the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the \nstate party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but \ninvolves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-\ninternational Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both \nthe State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. \nRecognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the \ninsurgent group; \n\uf0b7 \nThose territories that are occupied \n\uf0b7 \nEstablished a government that exercised sovereign rights over the territory it \noccupied. \n\uf0b7 \nComplied with the laws and customs of war during hostilities with the State. \n(Bartels, 2009)  \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. \nnon-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and \nmilitary forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups. Hostilities must reach a \nparticular level of severity and the parties engaged must be well-organized in order to be \nclassified as an international armed conflict.

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating \ncolonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise \nof their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict \nbetween two or more states. \n2. non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or \nif it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency \nbetween civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian \nobjects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \nPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian \npopulation are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and \nsuffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to \nthe principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military \nnecessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and \nare not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed \nconflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities \n(Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, \nnecessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is \nbased on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance \nthe expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the \nequation, military necessity is the other.  \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is \nnecessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not \notherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not \nwithdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, \nand may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they \nare or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more \nrestrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always \nemploying restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions \nmay be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is \nessential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's \nmilitary foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its \nprimary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is \nbest described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of \nmilitary force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of \nIHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons \nwho are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to \nsafeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured \ncivilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' \nAdditional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures \nthat persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a \nconflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military \nobjects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians \n(Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\".

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military \ncyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Belligerents would also have to take all \nnecessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-\nattacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated \nand providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result \nof an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be \nheld responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. \nTo put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed \nconflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations \n(Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that \naim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian \ngroups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
