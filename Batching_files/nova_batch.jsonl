Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace \nand con\ufb02\n ict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d\u200a4 Among these customary and \u201clong stand-\ning international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, \nthis principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal \nacts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or \ncontrol. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as \nit was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space \nwas \ufb01\n nite and obvious. How can this old wine \ufb01\n t into the new bottles of ubiquitous \nand dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of \nan armed attack?\nI will \ufb01\n rstly brie\ufb02\n y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law \n(2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns \nthe applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-\nevance in this \ufb01\n eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to \na series of speci\ufb01\n c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber \ndiligence\u201d obligation and the need to \ufb01\n nd a right balance between the obligation to \nprotect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to \nrespect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having \nthis in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation \nto enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against \nothers States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber \ninfrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react \nin relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-\nply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and \nduties of States, to more speci\ufb01\n c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in \ninternational environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in \ninternational human rights law.\n2. \nDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. \nAccording to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv.

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take?

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures?

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant.

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \n\u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n51 \nAlabama Claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, supra note 35, p. \n131.\n52 \nThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \nLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human \nRights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be dif\ufb01\n cult to investigate acts that violate individual \n61 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 9.\n62 \nAs the Tallinn Manual states, \u201c[t]he nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The \ntest in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \nThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \nAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\nedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \nits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \nGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \n22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \nthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \nChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

Having \nthis in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation \nto enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against \nothers States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber \ninfrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react \nin relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-\nply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and \nduties of States, to more speci\ufb01\n c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in \ninternational environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in \ninternational human rights law.\n2. \nDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. \nAccording to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState.

Among them, the most famous one is undoubtedly the Corfu Channel case in \nwhich the International Court of Justice (ICJ) famously said that \u201cevery State [has \nthe] obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the \nrights of other States\u201d.6\nToday, everybody agrees that the dictum of the Court expresses a general prin-\nciple of international law. It is also accepted that the duty of diligence goes beyond \nthe territory of States and covers \u201call activities which take place under the jurisdic-\ntion or control\u201d of States7 whereas these activities are conducted by the State itself or \nby others entities private as public.8 \n5 \nIsland of Palmas case (Netherlands v.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to \nM. N. Schmitt and L.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv.

Accordingly, not every claimed risk \nto life can entail for the authorities a requirement to take operational measures to prevent \nthat risk from materialising. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take?

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip \nfrom the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In \nthe \ufb01\n eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \n\u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d\u200a45 proclaimed \nby human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by \nhuman rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \nWe maybe \ufb01\n nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of \npositive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-\ngence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-\ntive, judicial and administrative measures in the \ufb01\n eld of human rights derives directly \nfrom the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-\ntion exist in the \ufb01\n eld of cyber diligence without a speci\ufb01\n c treaty?\n42 \nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-\ncies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or \npractice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-\nantees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31: The Nature of the General \nLegal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, \n26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \nSee for example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \n30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \nCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \nSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \nSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \nmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \n2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \nsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \n(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \n\u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n51 \nAlabama Claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, supra note 35, p. \n131.\n52 \nThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \nLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human \nRights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be dif\ufb01\n cult to investigate acts that violate individual \n61 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 9.\n62 \nAs the Tallinn Manual states, \u201c[t]he nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The \ntest in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \nThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \nAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\nedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \nits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \nGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \n22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \nthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \nChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

Due diligence is \nan obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result.10 According to S.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-\ncal importance.15\n3. \nFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-\nties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \n\u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory \nor under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect \nother States.\u201d16\nThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \n\u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from \nthe territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the \nhesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States \ndo not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this \nrespect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-\nritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \n15 \nICJ, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-\nary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-\nties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-\nside the context of armed con\ufb02\n ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet \nand cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-\nspace, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may \ncreate effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities \nin cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM \nInter-Agency Legal Conference Ft.

This being said, we should not underestimate \nthe extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy \ncyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-\nedge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, \nthe available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the \nICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to \nnotify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed \nin relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in \ncyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-\nable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is \nlaunched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter \nhad or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-\ncome could be different. \n4. \nKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the \ufb01\n rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the \nICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) \nwere fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at \ntheir disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these \nobligations\u201d.19\nStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening \non their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded \nfrom the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that \nthat State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20\nIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous \nOsman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the dif\ufb01\n culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate \nburden on the authorities.21\n18 \nAs the ICJ determined, \u201cAlbania\u2019s obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines \nin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suf\ufb01\n cient time \nbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\nish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \nreported and the moment of the \ufb01\n rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22.\n19 \nICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \nv.

Due to the \nfact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof \ncould become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach \nof international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate \nthe existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel \njudgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact \nand circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, \nprovided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \nIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of \nevents was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-\ndom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \nThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of \ndiligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber \nacts in question25 one should ask whether it should also be applicable in cases of \nconstructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a speci\ufb01\n c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-\ning that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether \nthis rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) \nknowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26 \n22 \nAs the ICJ observed, \u201cthe fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State \nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the \nknowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other \nState, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof \nof facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \nIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \nin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \nregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \nleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \nused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \nproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \nAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\nsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \nat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \nimmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\nnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \ninvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \ncase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \nSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \nhas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10.\n26 \nIbid., p. 28, para. 11.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In Corfu Channel the Court \nsaid that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \n\u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by \nlimiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its \nauthors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the \nuse made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \nThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-\ntrol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of \nHuman Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea \nof constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the \ufb01\n eld \nof Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidenti\ufb01\n ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-\nably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \nKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in \na position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take \nplace on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor \ncyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as \nit will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to \nprevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \nIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of \nadministrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-\ntoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other \nparty\u201d.29 \nThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-\nnerstone in the \ufb01\n ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of \nStates.30\n27 \nCorfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18 (emphasis added). \n28 \nOsman v.

Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in \norder to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-\nspondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated \ndebate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 \nIt should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise \nacts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit \nis clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international \nlaw\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise \nthat the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner \nwhich fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place \nrestraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to \njustice\u201d.33\nIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-\nmise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right \nto Privacy in the Digital Age, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December \n2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution \ninvites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of \nall their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-\nedge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act \noccurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White \nPaper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and of\ufb01\n -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the \nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35 \nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case \nfound that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to ful\ufb01\n l its due diligence \nobligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the \nattack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the \nCorfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian \nauthorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international \nresponsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the \nTerritory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance \nin preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by \nother actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their \nown account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, \nthe exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \nA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take?

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-\npean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to \nlife for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite \nnumerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \n\u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted \nin minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an \nimpractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \nOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-\ncerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the \nState\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against \nthe action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation \nof Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to \ntake reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the \nscene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct \nattacks\u201d.41\n39 \nIn the Lopez Ostra v. Spain case the European Court of Human Rights held for the \ufb01\n rst \ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-\nlation of Article 8 because there was suf\ufb01\n ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 \nenjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the \nState \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, \nECHR A303-C, para. 51.

The criterion of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d was clearly af\ufb01\n rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-\neral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. \nUnited Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite \nthe murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-\nsonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of \nnegligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest \nany speci\ufb01\n c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can \nisolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of \nreasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-\ning the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, \nfor instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the \nUnited Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found \nthat there was \u201cnegligence\u201d\u200a44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \nAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-\ntive measures?

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will \nrequire almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already \nexpressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this \ufb01\n eld.48 But since \ndue diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-\nsures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-\n \nintensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning \ncyber diligence, in order to impose speci\ufb01\n c and detailed obligations on States the \nadoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best \nexamples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council \nof Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic \ncriminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-\nvides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-\ntion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only \na multilateral instrument can introduce such speci\ufb01\n c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to \nenact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others \nStates, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case, \nStates cannot claim the insuf\ufb01\n ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due \npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to \ngive effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, \nVol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless \nCovenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties \nare required on rati\ufb01\n cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are \nnecessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-\ncies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or \npractice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-\nantees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31: The Nature of the General \nLegal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, \n26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \nSee for example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \n30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \nCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \nSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \nSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \nmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \n2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \nsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \n(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-\nate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its \nown cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this \ninfrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the \nICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from \nomission\u201d.55 \nBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to \nprotect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \n\u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n51 \nAlabama Claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, supra note 35, p. \n131.\n52 \nThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \nLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-\nness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \nHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect \ncyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 \nIndeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of \ndue diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on \nState Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to \nprevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59\nThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction \nwhich, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \nAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation \nto notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify \nhas been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60 \n56 \nJ. B. Moore, International Arbitrations to which the United States has been a Party, \nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this \n\ufb01\n eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an \nobligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want \nto secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly bene\ufb01\n t in helping \ndeveloping countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution \n64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the \ndigital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications \ntechnologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-\nfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially \nthe least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, \nA/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \nSee supra section 5.1.\n58 \nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have \nnever af\ufb01\n rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent \nthe occurrence of a possible event suf\ufb01\n ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence \nof such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. \nSee in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ntionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \nAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\n\ufb01\n cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \ndif\ufb01\n cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-\nnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \nto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \nzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM\nvia University College London\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

As the Tallinn \nManual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where \nthe cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto \nterminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not \ncontroversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could \nraise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different \ntools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties \ncountries and civilians. There is in this \ufb01\n eld an obligation for States to assess the \nnecessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \nOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary \nin order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of \ndue diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-\nation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take \nonce again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law \nand especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the \nCyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are \namong these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \nMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such \nacts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an \nindication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, \nafter the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the \nevent nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-\nritorial sovereign\u201d.64\nThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this \ufb01\n eld. \nDue diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human \nRights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be dif\ufb01\n cult to investigate acts that violate individual \n61 \nSchmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 9.\n62 \nAs the Tallinn Manual states, \u201c[t]he nature, scale and scope of the (potential) harm to \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required.

The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, \nthereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65 \nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and \ndissuasive\u201d\u200a66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention \non Cybercrime could be a reference in this \ufb01\n eld. \n8. \nConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-\nedge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. \nIts nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-\nness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The dif\ufb01\n culty to apprehend \nactivities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \nThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \na useful starting point in order to organise the \ufb01\n ght against States that could be \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for \ncyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does \nnot authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other \nStates, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech \nand the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the \nubiquity of cyber operations makes it dif\ufb01\n cult for States to implement the principle \nalone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably \nbe necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community \nand to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \n\u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the \nfuture of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between \nthese competitive interests.\n65 \nInter-American Court of Human Rights, Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v.

This shift presents \na significant challenge for law enforcement and legal professionals as cyber \ncriminals exploit the virtual landscape for illicit activities. \nE-Evidence encompasses a broad spectrum of digital data, such as emails, \ninstant messages, social media interactions, cloud storage, and browsing \nhistory. Cyber Forensics involves the scientific examination and analysis of \nthis digital evidence to unravel cybercrimes. \nThis paper delves into the core principles of Cyber Forensics, including the \nidentification, preservation, extraction, and analysis of digital evidence while \nensuring its integrity and admissibility in court. Despite cybercriminals \nattempting to conceal their digital footprints, forensic investigators employ \ntools and methodologies to trace events and identify perpetrators. \nAdditionally, the paper explores legal challenges and ethical dilemmas \nsurrounding E-Evidence and Cyber Forensics. Privacy concerns, \nmaintaining chain of custody, and adhering to data protection laws \nsignificantly impact the admissibility and trustworthiness of digital evidence \nin court. The evolving technological landscape necessitates continual \nupdates to legal frameworks to accommodate digital investigations. \nE-Evidence and Cyber Forensic techniques are indispensable in combatting \ncybercrimes.

However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and \nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence \nsubmitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers \nto data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic \nform or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The \nadmissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, \nand ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or \nerasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is \nconsidered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the \nadmissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where \nevidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, \nthe Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science \nLaboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was \nnot suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the \nconversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch \nwitnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to \nanalysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without \na credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted.

Digital \nevidence is volatile and easily tampered with, especially when stored in different \njurisdictions. Obtaining evidence in a timely and lawful manner becomes challenging. \nDiverse standards for admitting digital evidence in court create doubts about its authenticity \nand reliability. Maintaining the chain of custody for digital evidence across borders is \ncrucial but problematic. \nInternational cooperation, often facilitated by Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties \n(MLATs), aims to assist investigations and evidence collection. However, bureaucratic \ndelays in these processes hinder timely information exchange, allowing cybercriminals to \nevade justice. Political or diplomatic issues may also deter some countries from \ncooperating, providing safe havens for cybercriminals24. \nAnonymizing technologies like Tor and VPNs further complicate matters by masking \nthe origin of cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals leverage these technologies to obfuscate their \nlocation, making it challenging to trace them accurately. Efforts to standardize cybercrime \nlegislation and cooperation frameworks, like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, aim \nto address these issues, yet gaps persist due to uneven adoption. \n \n23 Amit Kumar Das, Types of Jurisdictions, WRITINGLAW.COM, Aug 8,2023  10 Types or Kinds of \nJurisdiction of Indian Courts (writinglaw.com) \n24 Jennifer Bussell, Cyberspace, BRITANNICA, Aug 8, 2023, Cyberspace | Digital Communications & Security \n| Britannica \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and \nthe Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence \nsubmitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers \nto data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic \nform or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence.

Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4. Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5. Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6. Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA).

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier. However, in the case of R.K. Anand v.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where \nevidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, \nthe Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science \nLaboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was \nnot suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the \nconversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch \nwitnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to \nanalysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without \na credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar \ncase, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements \nfor admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High \nCourt dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as \ndefined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a \nfeasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory \nchip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the \nlaboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being \ncompared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then \nthe transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or \nadmissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link \nbetween the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it \nas evidence in legal proceedings. Without such a link and without verification methods such as \ncomparing hash values, the authenticity and reliability of the digital evidence, such as the \ncontent on the CD, may come into question and might not be accepted as credible evidence in \ncourt16. \n \n15 CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4288  OF 2017 \n16 S.

However, this relentless pursuit of \ntechnological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant \ndrive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering \nthe landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, \ntechnology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals \nsuch as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, \nmobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a \ncollective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader \nconcept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities \nintricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these \ntechnologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the \nconventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, \neither as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in \nelectronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the \nreliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when \nassociated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within \nlegal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the \ncollection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of \nlaw, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber \nforensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the \njudicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital \nevidence in legal proceedings. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The Information Technology \nAmendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile \nphone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, \naudio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information \nTechnology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the \ndefinition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly \ninclude a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents \nencompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or \nphone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of \nthe Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone \nand this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of \nevidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice \nrecording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State \nof Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The \nadmissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, \nand ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or \nerasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is \nconsidered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the \nadmissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4. Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5. Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6. Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved.

There is no \nspecific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also \nruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of \ncalls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls \ncan be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in \nthe Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. \nInitially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on \nthe mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B \n(4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent \nwitness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including \nhow the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability \nand authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an \nexpert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian \nEvidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot \nSandhu10 mentioned earlier.

The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in \nthe form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in \naccordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court \nhighlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced \nby a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite \nanything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record \nproduced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-\nsection (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as \ncomputer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These \nconditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal \nproceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \nUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for \nadmitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the \ncomputer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing \ndata for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. \n(ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should \nhave been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) \nThroughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any \ndisruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The \ndata in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into \nthe computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't \nallow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B \nof the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament \nattack case. \n \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The counsel for the respondents argued that the \nconversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch \nwitnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to \nanalysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without \na credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted.

Introduction  \n \nThis essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles \n2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts \nin the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \nNations Charter \n \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The right to self-defense \n \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right \nof individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United \nNations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace \nand security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions \nhave created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the \nUnited Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter \nand rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state \nactors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions \nof the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address \nthat the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to \naddress current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, \nwhether they come from state or non-state actors.  \n  \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n10/19 \n \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists \nin the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose \nregulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on \nwho the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the \nattacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary \ninternational rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to \naddress this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules \nfor a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right \nto self-defense. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. \nThis is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced \nthe necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.   \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application \nof the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state \nactors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states \nbut also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, \nthe traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and \ntechnological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those \ntraditionally used.

Introduction  \n \nThis essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles \n2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts \nin the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \nNations Charter \n \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n4/19 \npurposes of the UNCH. The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The right to self-defense \n \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right \nof individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United \nNations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace \nand security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions \nhave created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the \nUnited Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter \nand rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state \nactors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions \nof the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address \nthat the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to \naddress current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, \nwhether they come from state or non-state actors.  \n  \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n10/19 \n \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists \nin the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose \nregulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on \nwho the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the \nattacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary \ninternational rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to \naddress this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules \nfor a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right \nto self-defense. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. \nThis is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced \nthe necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.   \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application \nof the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state \nactors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states \nbut also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, \nthe traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and \ntechnological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those \ntraditionally used.

About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about \nself-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present \nessay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the \nuse of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address \nconflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense \nas the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the \nconsideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in \ndevelopment since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of \npre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how \n21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the \nUnited Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed \nattack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state \nactors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional \nunderstanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks \nfrom hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy \nphysical assets.   \n \n2.

The first aspect to analyze is to understand which \nis the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the \nsecond term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is \nallowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The article \nreflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international \nrelations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political \nindependence of any State.   \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and \nsecond, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) \nin both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that \na threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 \nThe pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the \ninterpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the \nlaying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by \nUnited States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in \nforcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army \nand training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5  \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a \nthreat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, \nthen refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6 \nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use \nof force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 \nsettled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is \nexpressly prohibited.7  \nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the \nprohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n                                                          \n \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \nEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the \nCharter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective \ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression \nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and \nin conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of \ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, \nwhat needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned \npurposes.    \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is \nnecessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented \ninterpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the \nLaw of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United \nNations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna \nConvention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in \nArticles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith \nby the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of \nits object and purpose.   \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously \nexplained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: \nthat is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the \nscope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the \nextent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in \npursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore \ndemocratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view \nhas not been considered by states.    \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat \nand use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the \ntext, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should \nremain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.  \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the \ngeneral rule of prohibition of the use of force.  \n                                                          \n \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \n813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The right to self-defense \n \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the \nUnited Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right \nof individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United \nNations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace \nand security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be \nimmediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and \nresponsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems \nnecessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11  \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article \n51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right \nto respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based \non the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to \nself-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, \nunlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception \nto the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad \ninterpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be \nexplained in the following section.  \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense \nis part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and \nproportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such \nas the Nicaragua case.14 The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it \nexpressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized \nthat a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside \nArticle 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning \nboth sources.15  \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a \nconstruction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed \nattack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from \nthe attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised \nregarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any \ninternational rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion \nwill be addressed in the next section.   \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it \nis unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under \nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of \nthe right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary \ninternational law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the \nprimary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being \ncommitted or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will \nbe developed in the next segment of this essay. \n \n4. Anticipatory self-defense \n \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United \nNations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a \nwider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the \nscope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-\ndefense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under \nArticle 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19  \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does \nrecognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN \nGeneral Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. \nTherefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n                                                          \n \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. \n18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

At the time, Canada was under British \ncontrol while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state \nof peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the \nrebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara \nRiver, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship \non fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-\ndefense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British \ngovernment ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-\ndefense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21  \nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity \nand proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of \ngeneral rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor \nmoment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal \nanalysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, \nthat is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being \nlaunched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its \napplication are fulfilled.  \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and \nIsrael have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the \ndoctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23 \nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. \nFurthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack \nor it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when \nany further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or \navert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this \nanalysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25  \n                                                          \n \n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \n1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \n2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n8/19 \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat \nof the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided \ninformation regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to \nself-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, \non the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has \nalso presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-\ndefense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was \nthe cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent \nand not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a \nstate can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important \nto remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to \nthe attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to \nself-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter.  \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory \nself-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states.  \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been \ntraditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not \ndifficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, \nthe 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last \ndecade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. \nSince the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have \nraised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions \nhave created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the \nUnited Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter \nand rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state \nactors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions \nof the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address \nthat the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to \naddress current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, \nwhether they come from state or non-state actors.  \n  \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \nto a pre-emptive self-defense? \n \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and \nexplained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of \nconflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian \nLiberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place \nin April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following \na terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used \nforce to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery \nof a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant \nincident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28  \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state \nactors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold \nof an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition \nof armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary \ninternational law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated \nto satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new \nconsiderations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting \nextreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals \ntrained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist \norganisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that \nwithin a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29 \nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new \nconsiderations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the \nconsiderations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n                                                          \n \n26  C.

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n10/19 \n \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive \nself-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international \nauthorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational \nor directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-\nstate as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 \nOne can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-\nemptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be \nlaunched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by \nthe United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in \nthe United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign \nAffairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new \nthreats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal \ncreation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been \ninternationally agreed, yet.  \n \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense \nappears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the \nright to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. \nOn the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of \nthose two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state \nmight consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible \nattack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim \nthe right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive \ninterpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was \ninternational law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there \na need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of \ninternational law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current \ndiscussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n                                                          \n \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is \nhighly complex and debatable.    \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the \ninternational scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-\ndefense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory \nself-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere \npossibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, \nthe self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the \nnature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist \nbecome less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and \nspeculative.34 \nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-\ndefense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions \ngoverning self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual \nattack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that \neven when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still \ndemands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, \nbesides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect \non the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity \nto adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.  \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense \nand customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect \nand prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for \nnew mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A \nreflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the \nUS government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack \nto respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a \nUN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36  \nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the \nuse of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed \nattacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be \ndeveloped in the final section. \n                                                          \n \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. \n35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The case of US-led \ncoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \n \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the \nright to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s \ninterpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international \nlaw, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new \ninternational actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the \nexisting rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible \nfor saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the \nright to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for \nattacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-\nstate actors and cyber-attacks.   \n \n1.1 \nThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors) \nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and \nstates have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and \nin the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit \nthe Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and \nupdated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to \nISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.  \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried \nout by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition \nnations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the \nNetherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting \nairstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the \nUnited States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for \nthe first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n                                                          \n \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. \n38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \nGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the proper \nanalysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the \nthesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that \nwere plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of \nself-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in \nconsequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three \nmain issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-\nstate actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a \nposition on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules \nthat are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42  \nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to \nacknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s \narguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said \nthe vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could \ntrigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his \ninterpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage \nin self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language \nof the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its \nborders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna \nConvention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, \nthe context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state \nactors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.   \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are \nrestricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security \nCouncil. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include \nthe right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an \narmed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n                                                          \n \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3.  \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 \n42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \nof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238.  \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, this position seems to have little recognition among \ninternational lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military \ngrounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of \npeaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a \nsubstantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-\nstate actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor \nperformed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that \nthis fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state \nactor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot \nexercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent \nattack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by \nall means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is \nno provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory \nself-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open \na door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional \nprovisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. \nHowever, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their \ninterpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, \nPaust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the \nCharter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n \n1.2 \nCyber-attacks \n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. \nThus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists \nin the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose \nregulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what \nit stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the \nInternet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have \naccess to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46  \n                                                          \n \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254. \n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The first one occurred in Estonia in \n2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several \nweeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the \nwebsites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers \neven disabled the parliamentary email server.47  \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been \nfar more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, \npower grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, \nand social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or \nNATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the \nTallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, \nwhen Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous \nyear.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of \nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in \nattacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs of Georgia.50  \nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control \nadversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and \ndecision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a \ncyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and \ncontrol by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51 \nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial \ninstitutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under \nArticle 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in \nthe same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an \narmed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state \nis that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary \ninternational law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs \nto be addressed. \n                                                          \n \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \nSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.  \n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188. \n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \nExcellence, NATO, 2008).  \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \nJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Arias \n \n \n \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n \n16/19 \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s \nresearch. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang \nsays, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules \non state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is \nthe core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; \nhowever, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the \nrules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this \nunderstanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most \ncomplex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of \nthe rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In \nconsequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance \nagreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.  \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules \nare outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what \nrules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of \nthe use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary \ninternational standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not \ndifficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks \nwere not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of \nself-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for \nattacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of \na possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential \nprovisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-\nestablished customary rules of international law.54  \nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide \ninformation and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are \noutdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, \neven when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in \ndepth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law \nCommission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of \nStates for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n                                                          \n \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \nApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44.  \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013).  \n54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\nthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001).  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State \nunless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for \nparticular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the \nabsence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other \nmovements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be \nconsidered an act of that State under international law.57  \nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective \nto determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task \nbecause these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their \nidentity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, \nmost of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals \nrather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single \nactor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59  \nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine \nthe attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and \nthe right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60  \nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the \ntraditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with \nthe complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA \nArticles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure \nof cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new \nupdates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA \nrules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to \nsolve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have \nindeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As \nit was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining \nresponsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations \nneed to be developed to reduce the gap.   \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law \nApplicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n                                                          \n \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their \nterritory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or \nde facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect \nfor the sovereignty of other States.   \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and \nSouth Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group \nAnonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world.

On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states \nbut also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, \nthe traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and \ntechnological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those \ntraditionally used.

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique \nevaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare. \nKeywords:  \nAccountability,  \nConservative \nCritique \nCyber Warfare,  \nInternational \nHumanitarian Law,  \nProportionality \n*Corresponding \nAuthor:  \n \n \nsakambohadv@\ngmail.com \nIntroduction \nMore than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks \nthroughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. \nConflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI \nmight entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This \ncould be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer \nRobots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. \nIHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely \nto employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about \nweaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). \nThe following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant \non IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and \ncomputer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military \noperations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, \nand energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone \ngovernments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' \ninfrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most \nscholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence.

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations.

(Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more \nrestrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always \nemploying restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions \nmay be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is \nessential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's \nmilitary foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its \nprimary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is \nbest described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of \nmilitary force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of \nIHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons \nwho are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to \nsafeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured \ncivilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts.

The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\".

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state.

This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique \nevaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare. \nKeywords:  \nAccountability,  \nConservative \nCritique \nCyber Warfare,  \nInternational \nHumanitarian Law,  \nProportionality \n*Corresponding \nAuthor:  \n \n \nsakambohadv@\ngmail.com \nIntroduction \nMore than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks \nthroughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI \nmight entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This \ncould be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer \nRobots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. \nIHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely \nto employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about \nweaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). \nThe following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant \non IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and \ncomputer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military \noperations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and \ndevelopment, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, \nand energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone \ngovernments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' \ninfrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most \nscholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

However, the rules that are applicable to No-international \narmed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, \nwithout giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict.  \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional \nProtocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at \nthe international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. \nThe matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of \nconventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at \nan international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts \nat the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict  \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times.

Common article 3 is applicable \nto the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the \nstate party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but \ninvolves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-\ninternational Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both \nthe State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. \nRecognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the \ninsurgent group; \n\uf0b7 \nThose territories that are occupied \n\uf0b7 \nEstablished a government that exercised sovereign rights over the territory it \noccupied. \n\uf0b7 \nComplied with the laws and customs of war during hostilities with the State. \n(Bartels, 2009)  \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. \nnon-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and \nmilitary forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups.

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating \ncolonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise \nof their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict \nbetween two or more states. \n2. non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or \nif it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency \nbetween civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian \nobjects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \nPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian \npopulation are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and \nsuffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to \nthe principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military \nnecessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and \nare not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed \nconflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities \n(Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, \nnecessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is \nbased on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance \nthe expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the \nequation, military necessity is the other.  \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is \nnecessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not \notherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not \nwithdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, \nand may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they \nare or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more \nrestrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always \nemploying restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions \nmay be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is \nessential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's \nmilitary foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its \nprimary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is \nbest described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of \nmilitary force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of \nIHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons \nwho are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to \nsafeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured \ncivilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' \nAdditional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures \nthat persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a \nconflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military \nobjects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians \n(Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\".

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military \ncyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Belligerents would also have to take all \nnecessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-\nattacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated \nand providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result \nof an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be \nheld responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. \nTo put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed \nconflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations \n(Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that \naim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian \ngroups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as \na battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without \ntechnology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of \nwarfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL \nstandards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and \nissues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. \nEventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems \nquickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts \nand how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a \nmajor concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major \nhumanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer \nnetworks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for \nthe international community to address. In today's malware-ridden \ncultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \nSecond, I present a short review of the international debate concerning \ncyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of \nthe Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or \ncyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how \nIHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks \ninvolving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for \ncyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian \nfacilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-\nwarfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique \nevaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare. \nKeywords:  \nAccountability,  \nConservative \nCritique \nCyber Warfare,  \nInternational \nHumanitarian Law,  \nProportionality \n*Corresponding \nAuthor:  \n \n \nsakambohadv@\ngmail.com \nIntroduction \nMore than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks \nthroughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of \nattackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. \nAttacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer \nnetworks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer \nnetwork systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have \ncodes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as \neffective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \nCyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic \narmed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the \nidentification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, \nand how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual \nhacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and \nengaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. \nHackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal \nstatus of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that \nmay handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, \nunorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has \ncreated a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law \nto investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how \nInternational Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the \nTallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the \nNATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's \ncapital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique \nthe existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique \nhas been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority \nfor the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its \nenforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical \nanalysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber \nWarfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is \nqualitative. \n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be \nused for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while \nsecondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, \nbooks, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated \nunder IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether \na cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules \napply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will \ntake time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military \noperation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-\nphysical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL \noften called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between \ncivilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence \nits principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL \ndoesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed \ncyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber \nWarfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN \nCharter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute \nits tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways \nof war, it must be understood and react to these issues.

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. \nConflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. \nCyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and \ncombatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, \nnumerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're \nillegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of \nthe IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL \ndoesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. \nThis study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one \nof the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to \nprohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child \nsoldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts \nduring wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new \nprotocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children \nunder 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention \nand Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting \nparties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. \nAdditional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must \ninvestigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit \nconvention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons \nbeforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI \nmight entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This \ncould be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer \nRobots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. \nIHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it.

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated \nunder international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers \nand advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't \ndecided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. \nAfter describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare \nincidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of \ndifference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to \nparticipate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. \nMany cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely \nto have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and \nmethods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to \nencourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on \nhow to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined \nabove. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies \nmay concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or \nkinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never \nhappened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in \nthe future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we \ncan say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International \nLaw. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than \nthe kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and \nhacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because \ndamages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international \npeace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with \naim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy \nembedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity \ngrids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do \nnot inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by \nthe state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace \n(Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The \nreputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less \nas well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber \nWarfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the \nHundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second \nWorld Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare \nwould not take that long if it happens in the future.    \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred \nframework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear \nweapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear \nwar) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework \nto cyberspace, as cyber deterrence.

The US Army \nanalyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and \nany other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a \nseries of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick \nretaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution \nrequires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must \nthus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human \nbeings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the \nrise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a \nweapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending \ncompetition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the \ndefensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form \nof threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has \nbrought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence \ntheory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first \nrecognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The \ndifficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber \nWarfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a \nneed for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is \nnow considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency \non the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with \ngreat power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure \nrotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely \nguided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like \nspace mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle \nbeams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical \nassets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate \nthem.  \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its \nmilitary is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and \ncommunication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. \nNot only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it \nalso extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new \nkind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology \nare now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using \nviruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending \non anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted \nin International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are \nalready ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively \ntarget those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more \nexpansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an \nimagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to \nmaintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways \nto justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some \nscholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that \nwrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \n\"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive \nand preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These \nconcepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and \nmay be modified in the future Just War Theory.  \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government \nmilitaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for \nactors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national \ninfrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the \ndigital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other \nuse of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not \ndifferent. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some \nscholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering \nmorality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties \nand Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra \ndamages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International \nHumanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent \nfew years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied \nto cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.  \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the \nresults of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And \nthis permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as \nCyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still \nneeded to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this \napplicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International \nCommunity in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber \nWarfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is \nnot addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation \nin the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber \nWarfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary \napparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has \nalso changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the \nGeneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application \na little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal \npolitical recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of \nIAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against \neach other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international \norganization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of \nNicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by \nthe law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed \nby the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context \nof pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the \nidea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International \nHumanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such \noperations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always \nbeen one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its \nrules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The \ncontext in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules \nand principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber \noperations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability \ncompletely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a \ndoubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown \nbelow. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection \nbetween the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In \nanother way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not \ngovern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the \nscope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under \nIHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold \nrelationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into \nconsideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. \nA cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed \nconflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international \ncharacter and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, \nPartsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any \nother armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated \nunder Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting \nparties does not consider the situation to be a war.

Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating \ncolonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise \nof their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict \nbetween two or more states. \n2. non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or \nif it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber \noperations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are \ngoverned by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or \nin addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack \non the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks \nand cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-\nattack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state \nemployees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event \nof an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to \ninterrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet \nthe basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power \ngrids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil \npipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all \nare heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and \noperation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency \nbetween civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian \nobjects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \nPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian \npopulation are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and \nsuffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to \nthe principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL.

When there is a situation of an armed \nconflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities \n(Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, \nnecessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is \nbased on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance \nthe expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

(Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more \nrestrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always \nemploying restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions \nmay be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is \nessential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's \nmilitary foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its \nprimary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of \nmilitary advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor \nof the consequence upon which activities are predicated).

Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. \nPetersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the \nenemy state by attacking only its military forces.  \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an \nattack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \n\"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and \ncombatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies \nto both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' \nAdditional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures \nthat persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a \nconflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military \nobjects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians \n(Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the \nobject of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a \nreasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or \ndestruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct \nmilitary advantages expected\". When it comes to applying IHL principles to the area of \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Another issue in \nimplementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected \naccidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military \nadvantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against \nanticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of \nCyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which \ntypes of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in \nimplementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. \nThe challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates \nthe problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new \nnotion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the \ninterconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible \noutcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents \nagainst the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be \nobserved in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of \nmilitary operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and \ntheir objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific \nprecautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or \ndeciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military \nobjectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and \nmeans of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk \nthat the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must \nbe required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a \ncyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that \nthe planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack \nwill not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to \nidentify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well \nas the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the \ncompetence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. \nTargets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in \nsuch a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the \npurpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military \nobjectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional \narmed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in \nany attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that \nparties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population \nobjectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure \nmust have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military \ncyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Belligerents would also have to take all \nnecessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-\nattacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated \nand providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result \nof an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be \nheld responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. \nTo put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed \nconflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations \n(Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that \naim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian \ngroups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed \nconflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health \nministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 \ncivilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in \nthis armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations \nof International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any \nviolations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.  \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the \nattacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to \na person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical \ndestruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere \ninconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to \neconomic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York \nExchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which \ncauses no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that \nthis research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.  \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical \nharm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with \nthe view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack \non the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine \nthe sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, \nespecially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on \ntheir territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government \nauthorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to \ncivilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage \nto physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is \ninternational and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is \nunable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next \nresearch finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or \nevaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare.  \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

This chapter has concluded this research that a new \ntreaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.  \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey \narea), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is \nscaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \n \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of \ncyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared \nto be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international \ncommunity, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, \nand, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, \nhowever, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence \nthe governance aspects are still not covered.  \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in \ncyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from \ninternational conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and \nChina appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power \nrelationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. \nFollowing the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of \nthem. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and \nindividual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. \nHowever, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought \nwith it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. \nCyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a \nnumber of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case \nwas investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in \nkinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a \ngeneral framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to \nunderstand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current \nIHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty \nfocusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n \n \n \n \n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}
