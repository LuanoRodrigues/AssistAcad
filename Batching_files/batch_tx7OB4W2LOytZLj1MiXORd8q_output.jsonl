We argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification and attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We contrast the political momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution and show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) has been a prominent and sometimes controversial feature of both academic and policy-oriented debates for more than a decade. At times it has seemed as if encounters between R2P advocates and critics have generated more heat than light and that their differences are more irreconcilable than ever. This is no doubt because both advocates and critics are motivated by a genuine attempt to prevent extreme violence directed towards civilians. On the one side, R2P advocates are compelled by the horrific circumstances of mass atrocity crimes, such as those that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica, as well as more recently in Libya and Syria. On the other side, critics are compelled by a concern that the idea of R2P might be exploited by states as a pretext for politico-strategic objectives, which can escalate, sustain or give rise to further violence. In other words, the debate largely concerns how best to reconcile the normative and political content of R2P.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we attempt to draw a line through this debate by closely examining the discourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical weapons attacks of 2013. This is a particularly useful case for three reasons. First, the issue of chemical weapons explicitly draws security and humanitarian imperatives into the same discursive space\u2014a dynamic captured in the International Relations (IR) literature on the \u2018chemical weapons taboo'. Second, the framing of chemical weapons as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) has served to politicise both their actual and potential use, particularly since the 2003 Iraq War. Third, the attribution of the chemical weapons attack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian conflict. Together, these dynamics make this a useful case for investigating the intersection of political and normative imperatives around R2P.</p>\n\n<h2>Analyzing the 2013 calls for Intervention</h2>\n<p>We begin by outlining the response from the R2P community to the use of chemical weapons in Syria in August 2013, which were described as a \u2018game-changer\u2019 by some key R2P advocates. It is first useful to establish the political landscape in which this response took place. One of the most notable factors was the public statements of the Obama administration, which adopted a two-pronged strategy of simultaneously imposing a so-called \u2018red line\u2019 on the deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime (formally issued by the President), as well as the incentive to pre-emptively disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile to avoid military repercussions (informally tabled by the foreign secretary). For instance, speaking at the Whitehouse on August 20 in 2012, Obama was resolute:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation. [\u2026] We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that\u2019s a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons. That would change my calculations significantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While condemnation of any possible use of chemical weapons was to be expected, the response suggested by Obama would require evidence of who was ultimately responsible based on a verified, independent, expert assessment. As events transpired, Obama did not enforce the \u2018red line\u2019 despite the use of forceful strategic and humanitarian arguments. Indeed, a complex set of factors both domestically and internationally combined so that those ends came about by different means. For instance, despite the Cameron government\u2019s arguments for military intervention, the deliberations in the British parliament did not ultimately support that policy, in large part because of heavy reliance in the Joint Intelligence Committee briefing on \u201cintelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources\u201d. In other words, there was a gap that need closing between what was known (via robust evidence) and what was merely presumed.</p>\n\n<p>The relevance of R2P to the conflict in Syria was clear long before August 2013. The UN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic documented concerns that violence in Syria since March 2011 may constitute crimes against humanity. From August 2012 the Commission added to its regular reports that it had reasonable evidence that war crimes had also been committed. The Commission even stated explicitly that \u201cThe Government has manifestly failed in its responsibility to protect its people\u201d, drawing on language on R2P from the World Summit outcome document.</p>\n\n<h2>R2P Advocacy and the Perception of Pretexts</h2>\n<p>One way to explore the risks associated with unreliable information is situate the different concerns of R2P in relation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances. As we noted earlier, for our purposes the concerns of R2P can be usefully delineated under the headings \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019. The former is about \u2018speaking R2P\u2019, which is to say describing a situation as R2P to elevate it within political debates; the latter refers to implementing and mainstreaming the prevention strategies of R2P throughout domestic, regional and international infrastructure, which may be done with or without describing it as R2P. It is important to reiterate that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather reflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates \u2013 particularly where independent attribution of mass atrocity crimes is unavailable \u2013 will entail two significant dangers. First, it will risk undermining the integrity of the R2P intervention. Toni Erskine has recently emphasised the moral imperative of informed decision-making around R2P interventions. This analysis suggests there are risks in proceeding with an R2P intervention before there is robust independent evidence to support that course of action.</p>\n\n<p>Second, R2P advocates would also risk amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian crises in pursuit of strategic ends. As Mallavarapu highlights, colonial legacies already leave some states suspicious of the power imbalances involved in military intervention for humanitarian purposes, especially when former colonial powers \u2014 who historically justified their initial conquest in moral terms \u2014 often lead interventions in their former colonies.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Robust evidence as a precondition for R2P legitimacy</h2>\n<p>This article set out to explore the tension between the normative and political content of R2P. We have argued that R2P advocates can be confronted by crisis dynamics where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification and attribution of R2P violations. At a minimum, any case for R2P based intervention, whether it is advanced by R2P advocates or states in the context of a UN resolution, needs to be based in robust, impartial and publicly verifiable evidence. The sort of robust and impartial case that we argue is a necessity would need to be based not only in a dialogue between expert communities about the facts at hand and the realities of the attribution process, but also in the public availability of basic technical data that could be analysed by multiple independent experts.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 11507, "completion_tokens": 1757, "total_tokens": 13264}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

However, this relentless pursuit of technological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant drive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering the landscape of crime.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, technology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals such as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, mobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a collective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader concept of 'computers' and their derivatives.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities intricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these technologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the conventional understanding.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, either as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in electronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the reliability of this evidence can arise.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when associated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within legal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of law, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber forensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the judicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital evidence in legal proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Navigating E-Evidence: Care and Caution</h2>\n<p>\nUnderstanding the intrinsic nature of electronic evidence holds tremendous significance, as it differs significantly from other forms of evidence. Manipulating electronic evidence is relatively easier, especially for experts regularly dealing with it. Hence, managing these intricate pieces of evidence requires exceptional care and caution.\n</p>\n<p>\nViruses, Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs), and physical damage stand as primary threats to electronic evidence. Adopting tried-and-tested tools and methodologies, confirmed by experts, becomes crucial to navigate the intricacies of complex evidence accurately. To mitigate errors during evidence collection, it's essential to subject the tools to simulated examinations each time they're utilized.\n</p>\n<p>\nPreserving the integrity of data is paramount, and therefore, experts and novices alike should refrain from manipulating sensitive information whenever possible. Adhering strictly to these fundamental practices can bring about a significant transformation in ensuring the successful conclusion of legal proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding the Legal Landscape: Federal Law on Evidence</h2>\n<p>\nTo ensure the admissibility of 'electronic evidence,' adherence to the 'best evidence rule' and 'chain of custody' is essential to mitigate any suspicion of tampering. The ideal evidence is considered to be in its original form, with printouts or outputs accepted as originals if they accurately reflect the information stored in a computer or similar device.\n</p>\n<p>\nA framework for admitting electronically admissible evidence is outlined in the Lorraine model. It emphasizes several key considerations:\n<ul>\n<li>Relevance: The evidence must have the potential to make a fact relevant to the case more or less probable than it would be without such evidence.</li>\n<li>Authenticity: It's crucial to establish beyond doubt that the electronic evidence presented is indeed what it claims to be, as electronic data can be easily altered. Thorough authentication is necessary to ensure its credibility.</li>\n<li>Hearsay: The issue of hearsay needs to be addressed, specifically whether the electronic data constitutes an assertion by the declarant and whether any exceptions to the hearsay rule apply.</li>\n<li>Original Document Rule: This principle refers to the admissibility of the original form of the document or evidence, emphasizing the importance of preserving the integrity of electronic evidence.</li>\n<li>Balancing Test: Lastly, the potential risks of prejudice, confusion, or undue delay versus the probative value of the electronic evidence should be weighed.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor proponents to successfully use electronic evidence, these fundamental principles must be meticulously followed.\n</p>\n<p>\nLogical Relevance: According to Federal rules of evidence, relevant proof is admissible while irrelevant proof is not. The court's determination of logical relevance is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. This logical relevance test is applied to electronic evidence in a manner similar to traditional evidence, ensuring fairness and consistency.\n</p>\n<p>\nAuthentication: Ensuring the authenticity of electronic evidence is crucial. Given the susceptibility of electronic data to manipulation, rigorous measures must be taken to maintain its admissibility. Courts must ascertain, beyond any doubt, the integrity and originality of electronic evidence to prevent any miscarriage of justice.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn summary, maintaining the authenticity, relevance, and integrity of electronic evidence is imperative to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings. Courts must rigorously scrutinize electronic evidence to maintain the fairness and accuracy of the judicial process.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Examining the Legal Landscape: Evidence Laws in India</h2>\n<p>\nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 was enacted to address the emerging need for regulations in cyberspace. It introduced concepts like 'digital signatures,' 'encryption,' and 'electronic evidence,' which were previously unfamiliar in the law of evidence. Initially, there were no provisions to introduce them as evidence in courts.\n</p>\n<p>\nConsequently, amendments were made to the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 to align it with the changing times and make it more adaptable. Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence submitted in the form of electronic data.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, \"electronic record\" refers to data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic form or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha) as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, audio, or images.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information Technology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the definition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly include a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents encompass digital records.\n</p>\n<p>\nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or phone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of the Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone and this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of evidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice recording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence.\n</p>\n<p>\nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The admissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, and ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or erasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is considered admissible evidence under Section 7 of"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 8478, "completion_tokens": 2048, "total_tokens": 10526}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

There are now frequent references to a \u201cfragmentation of the Internet\u201d, but many European and international working groups are also increasingly aware that \u201ca free, open and at the same time secure Internet\u201d is a global public good. To create and preserve the Internet as a public good, concerted global action is needed on the basis of a common norm, which makes states mutually responsible for their diligence in national regulatory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in the German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as the EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides for civil, police and military-defensive approaches to protecting information-technology (IT) systems and infrastructure.</p>\n\n  <p>In the course of the discussion about a new German cybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn of this year, a growing number of political voices have also argued that political regulation and digital sovereignty should be strengthened and renationalised. Politics must face up to the reality of the military becoming increasingly operative in cyberspace. This will be reflected in the German Federal Government\u2019s new White Paper as well as in NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s future cyberdefence. In other words, it will be implemented in the German and European security policy as well as in their defence missions and military procurement.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Due Diligence as a Guiding Principle</h2>\n  <p>\u201cCybersecurity due diligence has been defined as the review of the governance, processes and controls that are used to secure information assets.

Over the past few decades, automation has allowed the German economy to respond well to the global pressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost small and medium enterprises using its Digital Strategy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily important role in the Federal Government\u2019s international cybersecurity policy.</p>\n\n  <p>Important components of a functioning and reliable Internet-governance system are international organisations and fora such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which is responsible for the stable functioning of the Internet; the Internet Governance Forum (IGF), a multi-stakeholder forum established following the UN World Summit on the Information Society.</p>\n\n  <h2>Fighting Cybercrime</h2>\n  <p>The fight against cybercrime encompasses all non-military measures that protect civilian targets from digital attackers. First and foremost, this concerns critical infrastructure and personal civil rights (and liberties). Since the 9/11 attacks, the UN has passed a great number of resolutions in the fight against terrorism that could serve as points of departure for cyber security as well.</p>\n\n  <p>Germany has ratified the Council of Europe\u2019s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and backs the EU\u2019s cybersecurity strategy of February 2013, which uses the same approach as Germany, namely a cybersecurity policy that is defensive and police-based in orientation.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 31248, "completion_tokens": 1006, "total_tokens": 32254}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Introduction</h2>\n<p>The multiplication of cyber operations which target States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and vital infrastructure is today widely seen as one \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security. While these operations do not reach the threshold of an \u201carmed attack\u201d within the meaning of jus contra bellum, their damaging impact raises nonetheless pressing questions about the duties of States in this field and the ability of international law to deal with this new threat. For many observers, there is no need to develop new norms. According to the White House International Strategy for Cyberspace \u201c[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete. Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace and conflict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d Among these customary and \u201clong standing international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, this principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal acts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or control. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as it was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space was finite and obvious. How can this old wine fit into the new bottles of ubiquitous and dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of an armed attack? I will first outline the meaning of due diligence in international law. I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns the applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace and discuss the relevance in this field of the fundamental element of knowledge. I will then turn to a series of specific and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber diligence\u201d obligation and the need to find a right balance between the obligation to protect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to respect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy. Having this in mind, I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation to enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against other States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber infrastructure. I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react in relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Due Diligence as a Principle of General International Law</h2>\n<p>The principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. According to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration: \u201cTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war.\u201d This duty of due diligence has since then been reaffirmed and developed in many cases. Among them, the most famous one is undoubtedly the Corfu Channel case in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) famously said that \u201cevery State [has the] obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d. Today, everybody agrees that the dictum of the Court expresses a general principle of international law. It is also accepted that the duty of diligence goes beyond the territory of States and covers \u201call activities which take place under the jurisdiction or control\u201d of States whereas these activities are conducted by the State itself or by other entities public as private. The \u201crights\u201d to which the Court refers to are all unlawful acts that produce detrimental effects on another State. Nonetheless, while the occurrence of a damage to a third State is a necessary condition in order to engage the responsibility of the State for violation of the due diligence principle, it is not a sufficient one. Due diligence is an obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result. According to S. Heathcote, this means that States should \u201cdeploy their best efforts to achieve [the] desired outcome ... even if that outcome need not be ensured\u201d. However, the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d could give the impression that we are in the borderline between a normative and a merely political obligation. It could thus be better to declare that States have the obligation to \u201cemploy all available means\u201d or \u201cto take all available measures\u201d, or to \u201cdo all that could be reasonably expected of them.\u201d As the ICJ said in 2007 in the Genocide case: \u201cIt is clear that the obligation in question is one of conduct and not one of result, in the sense that a State cannot be under an obligation to succeed, whatever the circumstances, in preventing the commission of genocide: the obligation of States parties is rather to employ all means reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible. A State does not incur responsibility simply because the desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State manifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its power, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance.</p>\n\n<h2>3. From Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d</h2>\n<p>As a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activities including by extension, cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect other States.\u201d This duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity and whether these cyber operations are launched from the territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the hesitation of some experts, there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this respect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its territory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies in principle to illegal cyber-attacks. This being said, we should not underestimate the extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy cyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowledge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, the available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the ICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case, the availability of enough time in order to notify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed in relation to its due diligence obligation. With regard to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held accountable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand, if a cyber-attack is launched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter had or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation, the outcome could be different.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Knowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle</h2>\n<p>Knowledge is the first decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the ICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) were fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at their disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these obligations\u201d. States cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening on their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening. In a similar way, the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous Osman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \u201cfor the Court, and bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.\"</p>\n\n<h2>4.1. Knowledge and the Standard of Proof</h2>\n<p>The first problem is what will then be the standard of proof in order to show that a State knew that hostile cyber operations were taking place on its territory? Due to the fact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof could become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach of international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate the existence of knowledge. In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel judgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact and circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d In that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albania\u2019s knowledge of events was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United Kingdom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.</p>\n\n<h2>4.2. The Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge</h2>\n<p>This second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of diligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber acts in question, one should ask whether"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12300, "completion_tokens": 2048, "total_tokens": 14348}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire national territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control its cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and consequently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect in the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive measures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the separatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.</p>\n\n<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Various contemporary territorial conflicts have resulted in areas falling outside the effective control of the sovereign state (territorial state) \u2013 such as Transnistria (1992), Nagorno-Karabakh (1988\u201394), South Ossetia (1991\u201392, 2008) and Abkhazia (1992\u201393), Crimea (2014) and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to date) \u2013 or vast territories controlled by extremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State (2014 to date). The state\u2019s lack of effective control over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is traditionally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign territory. Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various reasons, such as an armed conflict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered by another subject of international law \u2013 various norms of international law that bind the territorial state become ineffective...</p>\n\n<h2>2. CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE</h2>\n<p>\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019. It is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders creating a new realm of human activity\u2019, and its innovative nature seems to provoke new problems in law, especially in international law...</p>\n\n<h2>3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE</h2>\n<p>Because of its non-physical character, at first sight cyberspace hardly fits within the traditional principles of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity, also enshrined in the UN Charter. A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not be regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by definition, transboundary character. However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated \u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law Commission (ILC). Today it is widely recognised by states and international law scholars that state sovereignty is applicable to cyberspace...</p>\n\n<h2>4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL</h2>\n<p>As cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general international law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyberspace as it is bound in the offline context. Indeed, states and international organisations have recognised that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online...</p>\n\n<h2>5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE</h2>\n<p>Certain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of international law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law. This suggests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative framework...

Recent scholarship demonstrates that the covert nature of cyber intrusions allows states to respond with restraint, avoiding escalation. But what happens when cyber intrusions become public and are highly visible? This article examines the rhetorical strategies employed by authoritarian Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs associated with a public cyber intrusion. Drawing on the conceptual language of image-repair and crisis communication theories and employing discourse analysis of original data in Arabic, we identify three types of face-saving strategies: diminishing, self-complimenting, and accusing. Our findings indicate that intrusions involving leaking or faking information bring about unique \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies that do not only deal with the intrusion itself but also with the subsequent information crisis. Overall, the article identifies how states employ diverse rhetorical strategies\u2014beyond attribution\u2014to narrate cyber intrusions and keep cyber conflict contained.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In July 2017, nearly two months after Qatar had suffered a cyber intrusion, the Qatari Ministry of Interior (MOI) held a press conference to reveal evidence concerning the intrusion. Rather than only providing technical details, the MOI broadcasted a dramatic video with intense music, thrilling graphics, and a spy-style vibe to reveal the intrusion step-by-step. In addition to delegitimizing cyber intrusions as acts of terrorism, the video emphasized the Qatari remarkable success in containing the intrusion and detecting its source despite the intrusion\u2019s sophistication.</p>\n\n<p>The Qatari press conference is not unique. When cyber intrusions become public knowledge, states do not only engage in technical strategies to block the intrusion and identify the initiator, but also manage their public relations\u2014they publish messages, hold press conferences, brief reporters, and rhetorically try to manage this crisis. These performative, social, and symbolic strategies are often left unnoticed in existing research on cyber discourse. While extant studies examine different elements in the discursive construction of cyberspace, threats, and responses, we know less about the narration of cyber intrusions after they had happened. Of course, many studies zoom-in on the discourse of attribution or credit-claiming by the initiators, but as this article demonstrates, there is much more going on discursively following cyber intrusions.</p>\n\n<p>This article explores the rhetorical strategies used by governments in response to a public cyber intrusion they suffered. In addition to obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted, protecting intelligence sources or technical capabilities, and identifying the initiator, we suggest that states employ rhetorical strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect their public image in front of domestic, regional, or international audiences.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p>Examining the strategies used by these states to \u201csave face\u201d is important for two reasons. Empirically, these strategies are a crucial stepping-stone to understanding the restraint and the limited nature of cyber conflicts. Existing International Relations scholarship focuses on the operational aspects of offensive cyber operations, showing that targeted states practice restraint in their response to cyber intrusions, and that escalation is not a common practice. However, we have little knowledge of how that restraint is legitimized, justified, and buttressed publicly. As Steele argues, in addition to systemic considerations, normative commitments, or institutional constraints, restraint needs to be strategically narrated. When cyber intrusions go public\u2014such as in the cases below\u2014targeted states employ \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to contain the crisis and avoid escalation.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to acknowledge that our findings are not exhaustive and do not include all possible strategies. For instance, our focus on public cyber intrusion means that the strategies of silence (not responding at all) or denial (claiming that nothing happened) were not really usable strategies. Further, theoretically, states also have the option of apologizing to their public for not preventing the intrusion. While apologizing might be considered appropriate in some contexts, it seems unlikely that a public apology by the targeted states would help mitigate any image-related costs, as it would probably be interpreted as an admission of failure and responsibility.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>In sum, this article shows that in addition to covert technical and political strategies to deal with cyber intrusion, states engage in performative public strategies to manage their image. Identifying the various strategies directs our attention to the agency of states\u2014how targeted states perceive the context of the intrusion, interpret it, and narrate it. Diminishing the magnitude of a cyber intrusion, complimenting the successes of the Self, and accusing the adversary of bad behavior allows states to mitigate image-related costs in front of a domestic and international audience and perform their role as ontological security providers. \u201cFace-saving\u201d strategies are the bread and butter of international society\u2014justifications, apologies, rejections, or acknowledgments\u2014are some of the ways states resolve tensions, legitimize their behavior, and reinforce or contest norms.

Introduction</h1>\n<h2>1.1 Cyberspace and International Law</h2>\n<p>States and non-State actors have become increasingly reliant on digital technology, such as computers and the networks that link them. States are heavily dependent on the use of cyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, have similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of property. The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security. While these cyber operations fall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This raises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can deal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both regional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.</p>\n<p>Cyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. First of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a significant level of anonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. All of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State actors. Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute whether international law applies in cyberspace or not. For example, Barlow expressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace and that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d. These arguments assume that cyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is borderless. However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that cyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions could take place. Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber operations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible option. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, regulation is highly necessary.</p>\n<p>What most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject to international law. There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the application of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how international law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of international law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled.</p>\n<h2>1.2 Purpose of the Study</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed.</p>\n<h2>1.3 Delimitation</h2>\n<p>Due diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal responsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of international organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State responsibility, but not relevant for the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in order to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. Jus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle applies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the use of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules about use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of the study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an armed attack. However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed if the due diligence principle is applicable. Other consequences of State responsibility will not be discussed.</p>\n<p>Cyberspace is a technical area, but the technical aspects of cyber operations will be covered only in order to understand the problems of cyber operations and how due diligence works in relation to this.</p>\n<h2>1.4 Method and Material</h2>\n<h3>1.4.1 The Dogmatic Method and Public International Law</h3>\n<p>To examine the due diligence principle in cyberspace, I have used a dogmatic approach. There are many different definitions of the dogmatic method, but the main feature is that it attempts to analyze what the established law is, and to interpret the content of the legal sources in question. At the same time, this is a study of public international law. Public international law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. In international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all States. Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able to interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of international law are different from the sources of domestic law.</p>\n<p>Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ contains the most widely recognized authoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law. The article states that the Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: a. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting States; b. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; c. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; d. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.</p>\n<h3>1.4.2 The Material and Its Relevance in this Study</h3>\n<p>Due diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed through international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand the principle. It is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding cyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually classified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements regarding their view on cyberspace. A few statements from States on the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and opinio juris.</p>\n<p>There are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. The few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due diligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of environmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to due diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary law.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 29790, "completion_tokens": 1444, "total_tokens": 31234}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The abilities of the perpetrators to cause destruction of both material and non-material assets and even injury and death to individuals through cyberspace have challenged traditional definitions of the use of force. The present study aims to investigate approaches to answering novel questions encountered by jurists attempting to deliberate on such matters. Answers to these questions should be reached within existent legal frameworks or codified within a novel legal framework. This study poses the question as to whether these attacks are covered by the prohibitions stipulated in Article 2(4) of the UN charter. It concludes that due to the novelty of the phenomenon, existing legislation inadequately regulates the use of cyberspace for hostile acts. Preliminary efforts such as codification of the Tallinn Manual by NATO have not produced the desired legal outcomes. Thus, the general principles and rules of international humanitarian law should be utilized for regulating hostile relations in cyberspace. As stated by Marten Condition a century ago, the absence of special regulations should not bar the enforcement of general regulations and the application of principles, common rules and duties. Governments require recognition of their right to defend vital infrastructure. Assuming an attacked state can identify the source of a cyberattack and attribute it to another government, response options include referring the matter to the UN Security Council or the International Court of Justice or undertaking retaliatory cyberinterventions or instituting armed reactions, assuming the principle of proportionality is observed.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Keywords</h3>\n    <p>Cyberattacks, use of force, humanitarian laws, Tallinn Manual</p>\n    \n    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>\n    <p>In 2009, a military international organization based in Tallinn, Estonia, known as the Supreme Cyber Defense Cooperation Center and instantiated by NATO, invited an international group of independent experts to author a set of guidelines for the creation of a law that could govern cyber-defense. The project, which was carried out by experts and international law researchers, sought to generalize legal and regulatory norms in modern warfare. International law guidelines regarding cyberwar stem from an expert-oriented process which created a non-binding document to expand cyberlaw and clarify existing documents about cyber-interventions and cyber hostilities.</p>\n    <p>The Tallinn manual can serve as an example of cooperative international law-making for the cyber-sphere, but due to its non-binding nature, it is inadequate as a basis for the current analysis. This discussion references other international documents and studies to more fully explore the creation and interpretation of existing international cyberlaw and justify interventions such as binding prohibitions and force. The prohibition of force is referred to in Paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the UN Charter, which states that \u201c\u2026all members should avoid threatening or applying force in their international relationships against the territorial integrity or the political independence of any country or any other method that is in contradiction to the United Nations\u2019 intentions\u201d. The prohibition is binding on members and non-members since these Articles express common rights. The only exception in the charter pertains to legitimate individual or collective defense.</p>\n    <p>A close examination of Paragraph 4 of Article 2 prompts the following questions:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>What does the concept of \u201cforce\u201d, as used in Article 2(4), connote exactly?</li>\n        <li>Are economic or political embargoes considered \u201cforce\u201d?</li>\n        <li>Can \u201ccyber force or power\u201d be construed as force for the purpose of this provision?</li>\n    </ul>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1002, "completion_tokens": 948, "total_tokens": 1950}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

Arias</p>\n<p>This essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles 2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts in the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about self-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present essay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the use of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address conflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense as the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the consideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in development since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed.</p>\n<p>In this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which is the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the second term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is allowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter.</p>\n<p>The general prohibition of the use of force is a treaty-based rule established in the United Nations Charter (from now on \"UNCH\") and a rule of customary law that has evolved particularly in recent years. It is a treaty-based rule because it is recognized in the United Nations Charter, but at the same time is accepted as being representative of customary international law in the terms expressed by the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) in the Nicaragua case.</p>\n<p>Article 2(4) of the UNCH express that members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations (UN). The article reflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international relations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political independence of any State.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and second, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) in both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal. The pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the interpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the laying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by United States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in forcible struggle against the government could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army and training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.</p>\n<p>The main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council.</p>\n<p>As it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. This is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced the necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.</p>\n<p>Finally, even when strong arguments were presented to provide a position on how the United Nations Charter rules are outdated to address sophisticated and modern conflicts; the topic remains controversial and highly contested.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 12328, "completion_tokens": 965, "total_tokens": 13293}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Computer systems are often not the end target of attackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. Attacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer networks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer network systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have codes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as effective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. Cyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic armed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder.</p>\n\n<p>Cyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the identification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, and how much damage they wreak using malware. Cyber Warfare is a fight between two nations, not between individuals. Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual hacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and engaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. Hackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal status of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that may handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, unorganized, and susceptible to interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Many governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has created a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law to investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how International Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the Tallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.</p>\n\n<h2>Cyber Warfare Arguments</h2>\n<p>IHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated under IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether a cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules apply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will take time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military operation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-physical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL often called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between civilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war; hence its principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL doesn't apply to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed cyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN Charter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Cyberwar refers to an attack on computer systems by means of the digital world. Even if the data center included government records, firing a missile against it would not be deemed Cyber Warfare. Using hackers to spy on or steal data would not be considered cyber warfare in itself, but rather cyber espionage, which is carried out by practically all nations of the world. This chapter has concluded this research that a new treaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.</p>\n\n<p>For Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey area), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is scaremongering that could lead to dangerous development.</p>\n\n<p>During my research on Cyber Warfare, analyzing the existing situation of cyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared to be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international community, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, and, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, however, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence the governance aspects are still not covered.</p>\n\n<p>The data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in cyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from international conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and China appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power relationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. Following the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of them.</p>\n\n<p>The Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and individual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. However, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought with it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. Cyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, including a number of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case was investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in kinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a general framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to understand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current IHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare; therefore, a new treaty focusing on cyber-warfare must be established.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 10567, "completion_tokens": 1247, "total_tokens": 11814}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}
