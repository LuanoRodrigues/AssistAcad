Taylor \nAbstract \nThis article explores the problem of attribution in the context of R2P intervention through an analysis of the Syrian chemical weapons attack of 2013. We argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification and attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We contrast the political momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution and show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIntroduction \nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) has been a prominent and sometimes controversial feature of both academic and policy-oriented debates for more than a decade. At times it has seemed as if encounters between R2P advocates and critics have generated more heat than light and that their differences are more irreconcilable than ever. This is no doubt because both advocates and critics are motivated by a genuine attempt to prevent extreme violence directed towards civilians. On the one side, R2P advocates are compelled by the horrific circumstances of mass atrocity crimes, such as those that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica, as well as more recently in Libya and Syria.  On the other side, critics are compelled by a concern that the idea of R2P might be exploited by states as a pretext for politico-strategic objectives, which can escalate, sustain or give rise to further violence. In other words, \n2 \nthe debate largely concerns how best to reconcile the normative and political content \nof R2P. \nIn this article, we attempt to draw a line through this debate by closely examining the \ndiscourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical weapons attacks of 2013.1 This is a \nparticularly useful case for three reasons. First, the issue of chemical weapons \nexplicitly draws security and humanitarian imperatives into the same discursive \nspace\u2014a dynamic captured in the International Relations (IR) literature on the \n\u2018chemical weapons taboo'.2 Second, the framing of chemical weapons as Weapons of \nMass Destruction (WMD) has served to politicise both their actual and potential use, \nparticularly since the 2003 Iraq War. Third, the attribution of the chemical weapons \nattack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian \nconflict. Together, these dynamics make this a useful case for investigating the \nintersection of political and normative imperatives around R2P.3\nWe argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the \npolitical momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification \nand attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We analyse the political discourse after the \nSyrian chemical weapons attack and highlight the way many advocates called for R2P \n1 This collaboration was born out of a desire for dialogue on humanitarian intervention that reaches across sub-disciplinary boundaries \u2014 in this case, security/IR theory (Tim Aistrope), R2P/UN (Jess Gifkins), and arms control and disarmament (N.A.J. Taylor).

We then contrast the momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution carried out by the United Nations (UN) Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  We show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIn order to make this case, the first section begins by outlining the various claims made about the Syrian chemical weapons incident of 2013. The second section explores the dangers of mobilising political momentum by examining the reliability of evidence provided by states to make the case for military interventions. We do this via \nan analysis of \u2018intelligence\u2019, which is an information product that makes probabilistic estimates about current events and possible futures. We then show that crisis dynamics can incentivise information emanating from states over and above independent attribution. Section three assesses the significance of these insights for the R2P project and identifies some practices that are particularly vulnerable to these crisis dynamics. \nHowever, before we proceed we must first establish the scope of this article, which \nincludes what we mean by \u2018R2P\u2019. Our understanding of R2P draws from the version that was agreed by national leaders in the 2005 World Summit outcome document. Here they were clear that R2P is concerned with four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.4 As such, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described it as \u2018narrow but deep\u2019.5 What this means is that R2P is not synonymous with humanitarian intervention, but encompasses \n4 \nquestions as wide-ranging as inclusive governance and strengthening domestic \nresilience, which can be effective in militating against such crimes.6 This article \ndiscusses the coercive (and contentious) elements of R2P, but we start from the \nunderstanding that this is only one aspect of what R2P involves. \nIt can be helpful then to conceptualise R2P as three pillars \u2013 a frame used by the \nUnited Nations and by most R2P literature currently. The first pillar requires states to \nprotect their own populations from mass atrocity crimes, and applies to all states \nalways. The second pillar envisages a cooperative relationship between states and \nrelevant neighbours, regional organisations and international organisations, whereby \nstates are assisted in providing protection to their peoples.7 Pillar three can involve \nconsensual tools8 such as mediation, peacebuilding and unarmed civilian \npeacekeeping9, as well as coercive tools such as sanctions and peace enforcement \nwhere states have \u2018manifestly failed\u2019 to provide such protection. Unsurprisingly, \npillars one and two are less contentious as they presume only consensual actions. We \nunderstand R2P as a spectrum of activities and tools, aimed at preventing and \nresponding to mass atrocity crimes, which can include both consensual and coercive \nelements. R2P does not equate to humanitarian intervention, despite some who argue \nthat the primary focus of R2P is or should be humanitarian intervention,10 and others \nwho fear that R2P will lead to more use of humanitarian intervention.11\nGiven the many concerns of R2P, we deploy a further delineation in the final section \nof the essay: \u2018policy agenda\u2019 and \u2018rallying cry\u2019.12 The \u2018policy agenda\u2019 heading refers \nto the ideal that effective use of prevention tools will lead to fewer crisis situations \n6 Stephen McLoughlin, The Structural Prevention of Mass Atrocities: Understanding Risk and Resilience (Abingdon: Routledge, 2014). \n7 For discussion on pillar two, see Adrian Gallagher, (2015). \u2018The Promise of Pillar II: Analysing international assistance under the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, International Affairs, 91, no. 6: 1259-1275. \n8 For discussion on the peaceful components of pillar three, see Alex J.

The \u2018rallying \ncry\u2019 focuses on situations where mass atrocity crimes are occurring or foreseeable in \nthe immediate future, and the idea that labelling a crisis an \u2018R2P situation\u2019 can help to \nelevate it above politics as usual to garner a quick and decisive response. It is \nimportant to recognise that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather \nreflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. \nThe R2P agreement outlines the requirement that the use of force has authorisation \nfrom the UN Security Council: as such the R2P agreement does not change \ninternational law. In cases where R2P is used as a rallying cry towards advocacy for \nhumanitarian intervention the decision \u2013 per the R2P agreement \u2013 rests with the UN \nSecurity Council. The Council is a political body, requiring agreement from nine of \nits fifteen members and the agreement (or abstention) of all permanent members, but \nwith few other formal restrictions on its decision-making.13 Legitimacy is central to \nthe ability of the Security Council to wield power.14 As the debates over the Iraq war \nhave demonstrated, credible evidence is intimately bound up with questions of \nlegitimacy over decisions on the use of force. Though evidence is not a legal \nrequirement for a UN Security Council decision (agreement between members is key) \nwe suggest that any proposal for R2P intervention needs to give credible evidence and \nreasons that justify that course of action.15\nAnalyzing the 2013 calls for Intervention \nWe begin by outlining the response from the R2P community to the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria in August 2013, which were described as a \u2018game-changer\u2019 by some \nkey R2P advocates.16 It is first useful to establish the political landscape in which this \nresponse took place. One of the most notable factors was the public statements of the \nObama administration, which adopted a two-pronged strategy of simultaneously \n13 The UN Security Council is bound by the UN Charter (1945) and its Rules of Procedure which remain \n\u2018provisional\u2019. \n14 Ian Hurd, After Anarchy: Legitimacy and Power in the United Nations Security Council, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007). \n15 For discussion on this point, see Antonios Tzanakopoulos, \u2018Strengthening Security Council Accountability for Sanctions: The Role of International Responsibility\u2019, Journal of Conflict & Security Law 19 no. 3 (2014): 409-426. 16 Gareth Evans \u2018R2P down by not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, Open Democracy, 9 September, 2013; Weiss \u2018After Syria, Whither R2P?\u2019, E-International Relations, 2 February, 2014, 36. We use the term R2P advocates throughout in its broadest possible sense, recognizing of course the plurality of perspectives and approaches that inform R2P advocacy. For instance, in sharing our paper at conferences and other forums, one interlocutor was apt to point out that the Foreword to the 2011 ICISS Report detailed the main points of division between the twelve Commissioners.  See ICISS, The Responsibility to Protect: The Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, (Ottawa: International Development Research Centre, 2010) \n6 \nimposing a so-called \u2018red line\u2019 on the deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime (formally issued by the President), as well as the incentive to pre-emptively disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile to avoid military repercussions (informally tabled by the foreign secretary). For instance, speaking at the Whitehouse on August 20 in 2012, Obama was resolute: \n\tWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the \tground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical \tweapons moving around or being utilized.  That would change my \tcalculus.  That would change my equation. [\u2026] We have communicated in no \tuncertain terms with every player in the region that that\u2019s a red line for us and \tthat there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on \tthe chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.  That would \tchange my calculations significantly.17 \nWhile condemnation of any possible use of chemical weapons was to be expected, the response suggested by Obama would require evidence of who was ultimately responsible based on a verified, independent, expert assessment. As events transpired, Obama did not enforce the \u2018red line\u2019 despite the use of forceful strategic and humanitarian arguments. Indeed, a complex set of factors both domestically and internationally combined so that those ends came about by different means. For instance, despite the Cameron government\u2019s arguments for military intervention, the deliberations in the British parliament did not ultimately support that policy, in large part because of heavy reliance in the Joint Intelligence Committee briefing on \u201cintelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources\u201d.18 In other words, there was a gap that need closing between what was known (via robust evidence) and what was merely presumed. At the same time, the Obama administration remained unsure about both the appetite of the Congress to sanction any such military action (especially in light of Britain\u2019s stance), as well as the likely impact it would have on the Iran nuclear deal being negotiated at the time. Former secretary of defence Leon Panetta, for example, has subsequently told The Atlantic that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know it was coming\u201d.19\n17 Office of the Press Secreat \nDay, \u2018Syria: Reported Chemical Weapons Use \u2013 Letter from the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee\u2019, Cabinet Office, 29 August 2013, 1.\n19 Jeffrey Goldberg, \u2018The Day Obama Broke with the Washington War Hawks\u2019, The Atlantic, April 2016. http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/473025/syria-red-line-that-wasnt/. \n7 \nThe relevance of R2P to the conflict in Syria was clear long before August 2013. The \nUN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic \ndocumented concerns that violence in Syria since March 2011 may constitute crimes \nagainst humanity.20 From August 2012 the Commission added to its regular reports \nthat it had reasonable evidence that war crimes had also been committed.21 The \nCommission even stated explicitly that \u201cThe Government has manifestly failed in its \nresponsibility to protect its people\u201d, drawing on language on R2P from the World \nSummit outcome document.22 The perpetration of mass atrocity crimes is not a \n\u2018threshold criteria\u2019 for the applicability of the responsibility to protect \u2013 indeed the \n2005 World Summit is clear that the scope of R2P includes the prevention of such \ncrimes. However, since some commentary behaved as if evidence of the perpetration \nof mass atrocity crimes was a criterion \u2013 and such evidence is key to perceptions of \nlegitimacy \u2013 it is worth recognising that the evidence of both crimes against humanity \nand war crimes was available long before August 2013. The scale of these crimes was \nsuch that a month prior to the chemical weapons attack the Commission reported that \n\u201c[w]ar crimes and crimes against humanity have become a daily reality in the \ncountry\u201d.23 By August, more than 100,000 people had been killed in Syria since the \nconflict began.24\nThere was no doubt that the situation in Syria fit within the purview of R2P, including \npillar three of R2P, with the Syrian government \u2018manifestly failing\u2019 to protect their \npopulation from war crimes and crimes against humanity. The R2P agreement is \nclear, however, that while coercive measures \u2013 including the use of force \u2013 can be \nused, it requires authorisation from the UN Security Council, in line with the UN \nCharter. \nDespite this, media discussion on Syria shifted after the chemical weapons attacks, \nand became more likely to refer to the responsibility to protect. For example, in the \n20 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 23 November, 2011. A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1: 20. \n21 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 16 August, 2012. A/HRC/21/50. \n22 Ibid: 1. \n23 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 18 July, 2013. A/HRC/23/58: 2. \n24 \u2018Syria Death Toll now above 100,000, says UN Chief Ban\u2019, BBC 25 July, 2013. Available at  \n8 \nthree months leading up to the attack on 21 August 2013 there were less than 100 news articles on Syria which referred to the responsibility to protect, yet in the three months after there were over 400 news articles which drew the connection.25 In fact, the year 2013 had more newspaper discussion on the connection between Syria and R2P than any other year to date, with 1172 articles in total, half of which referred to chemical weapons.26 This shows a shift in media discussion of Syria in relation to R2P, beyond the specific statements made by R2P advocates. \nIn addition to the general media increase in discussions linking Syria and R2P, prominent R2P advocates made the argument that military intervention could be an appropriate response provided the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government \ncould be proven. Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock made a strong argument that \u201cR2P can and should be used as the basis for action in Syria\u201d however this was caveated by their requirement that attribution of the Syrian government using chemical weapons be established first.27 After the chemical weapons attack Gareth Evans laid out a moral argument for taking military action against the Syrian government if indeed it had used chemical weapons.28 It is worth pointing out that these three figures are not merely commentators on R2P. Each played key roles in the creation and formalisation of R2P. Axworthy initiated the original Commission which developed the responsibility to protect in his former role as Canada\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister; Rock \nwas Canada\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations during the 2005 World Summit negotiations; and Evans was Co-Chair of the original Commission. The important point here is that these significant R2P advocates saw the use of chemical weapons as a decisive event that made intervention a necessity so long as there was proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator. \nOf course, the attribution of the chemical weapons attack intersected with the political realities of the time. Prior to the chemical weapons attack there was little momentum for military intervention in Syria, whereas afterwards there was a period where \n25 A Factiva search of news articles with the search terms \u2018Syria\u2019 and \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 between 21 May 2013 and 21 November 2013 returned 530 original articles. Of these, 96 were prior to the 21 August chemical weapons attacks and 434 were after. This search was limited to English language news sources. \n26 A Factiva search of news articles by year shows 1171 articles in 2013 that referred to both Syria and the responsibility to protect, with an average of 777 per year in the subsequent 2014-2016 period. \n27 Lloyd Axworth and Allan Rock, \u2018Looking Back at Kosovo can move the Syria Conflict Forward\u2019, The Globe and Mail, 26 August, 2013. \n28Evans, \u2018R2P down but not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, lable at  \n9 \nseveral states and regional actors pushed for the use of force. First, the UK, along with other regional actors opposed to the Assad government, was enthusiastic about a strong military response.29 The chemical weapons attack was positioned as casus belli for intervention. At the same time, the Obama Administration initially sought to avoid direct military engagement in another Middle East crisis and pushed back against reports of chemical weapons use, questioning attribution to forestall further involvement \u2013 before shifting towards intervention under political pressure from allies and domestic partisans.30 Meanwhile, states supportive of the Assad government \u2013 notably Russia and Iran \u2013 questioned the origins of the chemical weapons attacks and identified the Islamic State as an alternative perpetrator, pointing to their alleged use of chemical weapons earlier in the conflict. These states were quick to dismiss the humanitarian dimension of the crisis and framed such claims as a convenient pretext for western intervention.31\nThe point here is that advocacy for R2P intervention arose in a broader geopolitical context that had the potential to influence information about the chemical weapons attacks. R2P advocates may have wanted proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator, but the evidence of attribution available in the crisis moment, as the momentum for intervention gained pace, was potentially problematic. Moreover, these advocates faced strong incentives to take this information seriously, when the case for intervention made by states combined strategic arguments about deterrence and regional stability with humanitarian arguments that connected with the concerns of R2P. Indeed, as we indicated above, the language of R2P was already widely operative in media coverage and political commentary on the chemical weapons attack, often woven together with confident assertions that the Assad government was to blame for the attacks.32 The next section explores the way political dynamics can \n29 Geraint Alun Hughes, \u2018Syria and the Perils of Proxy Warfare, Small Wars & Insurgency\u2019, 25, no. 3 (2014): 522-438. \n30 Michelle Bentley, \u2018Syria and the Chemical Weapons Taboo: Exploiting the Forbidden\u2019, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016); Bentley, \u2018Chemical Weapons Are Being Used in Iraq \u2013 but the US Won\u2019t Raise Hell about It\u2019, The Conversation, September 23, 2016.

Even when the Obama Administration changed tack on intervention, they sought political cover and public sanction by putting the proposal before Congress, rather than relying on executive powers. \n31 Carroll Bog, 26 September, 2013. Available at  Putin, \u2018A Plea for Caution from , New York Times\n32 At the same time, there was a widespread assumption that independent attribution would confirm the Assad regime was behind the attacks. It is certainly the case that any R2P proposal for intervention in Syria was only, at this stage of the conflict, intended to protect Syrian civilians from the Syrian government. \n10 \nshape information provided by state intelligence agencies and the media, then contrast this with the technical process of independent attribution. In this context, we suggest R2P advocates needed to take seriously the question of what counts as proof. \nIntelligence, Attribution and R2P Intervention \nNumerous sources feed into public perception of international crisis. While reporters \n\u2018on the ground\u2019 play an important role, by far the most common channel of information about an international crisis comes from governments. We focus on the special character of \u2018intelligence\u2019 the chief source of information emanating from states to illustrate the way national interest imperatives intersect with the representation of the crisis like the Syrian chemical weapons attack. \nThe starting point for any account of intelligence should be to note that it is geared towards future action and is in that sense concerned with risk management. Faced with an uncertain and often incoherent environment, including enemies that conceal their activities and intentions, and actively seek to mislead, intelligence analysts can only hope to produce \u2018estimates\u2019 or \u2018assessments\u2019 of likely futures, couched in well-rehearsed caveats about probability and inherent limitations.33 Following on from here, it is crucial to recognise that the subjects of intelligence estimates are determined by the risks they may pose to a specific set of interests. Thus, intelligence must be understood as \u2018a system of knowledge in the service of power\u2019.34 It answers questions that are of concern to policy makers and political leaders, the end users of intelligence; the priorities and predispositions of users can influence the way these questions are answered, in terms of emphasis and priority; whatever intelligence is produced will be mobilised towards the user\u2019s strategic ends.35 In this sense, even impartial evidence and informed decision-making is thoroughly structured by national interest imperatives. \nThese structuring interests become much more explicit and influential around the justification of the use of force. As Bruce Berkowitz noted on the eve of Colin \n33 Richard K. Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: Knowledge and Power in American National Security, (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007); Mark M. Lowenthal, Intelligence: From Evidence to Policy, (Washington: CQ Press, 2006); Richard L. Russell, Sharpening Strategic Intelligence, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007). \n34 James Der Derian, \u2018Anti-diplomacy, Intelligence Theory and Surveillance Practice\u2019, Intelligence and National Security,8 no. 3 (1993): 35. \n35 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 66-103; Lowenthal Intelligence: 174-189. \n11 \nPowell\u2019s now notorious presentation to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD), intelligence is sometimes presented as fact \u2014a \u2018slam dunk\u2019 or a \u2018smoking gun\u2019\u2014 to strengthen the credibility of a political claim.36 Paul H. Barratt, former Secretary of the Australian Department of Defence, makes the same point regarding the Howard government\u2019s assertions about Iraqi WMDs: \nThe use of the phrase \u2018the Australian government knows\u2019 was a cardinal sin from the viewpoint of both Australian parliamentary procedure and professionalism in the treatment of intelligence. It admits of no doubt \u2013 this was not just an assessment, the best judgment we could make with the available evidence at the time, it was knowledge. We should not expect a \nsubsequent inquiry to find that evidence was \u2018thin, ambiguous, and \nincomplete\u2019, which was the finding of the inquiry led by former DFAT Secretary Philip Flood.37\nThe point here is that because intelligence is always structured by the interest of its end users, there is real potential for it to be mobilised towards broader strategic ends in ways that misrepresent the underlying estimate. A similar perspective on the Iraqi WMD case is given by Richard K. Betts, an eminent scholar of intelligence theory and practice: \nAlthough the bottom line analytic conclusion was wrong, in the absence of adequate collection it was the proper estimate to make from the intelligence available. No responsible analyst could have concluded in 2002 that Iraq did not have stocks of chemical and biological weapons concealed. The principle mistake was in the confident presentation of the analysis and the failure to make clear how weak the direct evidence was for reaching any conclusion and how much the conclusion depended on the logic of deduction from behaviour.38\nOf course, what Betts leaves out here is that intelligence agencies were placed under enormous pressure by Bush Administration policy makers to produce estimates in support of a certain policy ambitions. In this sense, there was a relationship between \n36 Bruce Berkowitz, \u2018The Big Difference Between Intelligence and Evidence\u2019, Washington Post, February 2, 2003. 37 Paul H. Barratt, \u2018The Case for an Iraq War Inquiry Global Change\u2019, Global Change, Peace and Security, 26 no. 3(2014): 333. \n38 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 115. \n12 \nthe strength of the estimates about Iraqi WMDs and the political context in which \nthose assessments were made.  More broadly, the leaked Downing Street Memo, \nminutes of a top level British Government meeting in July 2002, indicates: \u2018that the \nintelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\u2019.39 Put simply, the decision \nto change the Iraqi regime had already been made and WMDs, as well as ancillary \nhumanitarian arguments, were merely convenient pretexts that could justify the policy \nto the American public and the international community. What this episode indicates \nis the potential for intelligence to be mobilised towards the strategic ends of states. \nAs we noted above, another common source of information about international crisis \nis media reportage. However, the chemical weapons issue should remind us of how \nunreliable the media has been around WMDs.40 For instance, in the lead up to the Iraq \nWar in 2003, New York Times reporter Judith Miller published a series of articles \nasserting that Iraq had WMD and an ongoing active program to produce them. It \nturned out that much of this reporting was based in private briefings from a senior \nBush Administration official who claimed that there was incontrovertible intelligence \nto that effect.41 More broadly, the recent Chilcot Report, the UK government\u2019s inquiry \ninto the Iraq War, makes it clear that a comprehensive media strategy was an integral \npart of the push for war.42\nTo recap then: in the immediate wake of the Syrian chemical weapons incident the \nUK and Arab states asserted that the Assad regime was responsible.43 This claim was \nbased in undisclosed intelligence, the authority of which was mobilised publicly in \ntandem with emotionally charged images of Syrians dead or dying from exposure to \nchemical agents. At the same time, the provenance of the chemical weapons attacks \nwas muddied by competing claims made by other states, for instance, from Russia and \nSyria, as well as journalists, foreign affairs analyst, and the various non-state actors \n39 Mark Danner, \u2018The Secret Way to War\u2019, New York Review of Books 52 no 10 (2005). \n40 Perhaps the best acknowledgement of this fact is the mea culpa delivered by the New York Times about the failures of its pre-war coverage, which points to the way government officials exploited reporters to push the case for war. See The Editors, \u2018The Times and Iraq\u201d, New York Times, 26 May, 2004. \n41 Jack Shaffer, \u2018The Real Problem with Judith Miller\u2019, Politico, April 10, 2015. \n42  The Chicot Report advances a broader critique of the case for war, which is scathing in its assessment of the way intelligence wvailable at  \nAvailable at  As we noted  framework of non-intervention. \n13 \non the Syrian battlefield.44 R2P advocates making the case for intervention were put in a position where the information immediately available was provided by self-interested states and a potentially briefed media, both with a recent history of unreliability around WMD. \nBy contrast, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally have formed the basis for determining responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks was unavailable. This is largely because chemical weapons experts establish attribution through rigorous, transparent and verifiable methodologies focused on the assessment of technical information about the chemical agent and the delivery system in question. There are technical, practical, legal and political hurdles that can constrain a swift outcome. In the context of the Syrian chemical weapons attacks, technical constraints on UN inspections include not only the procurement of evidence, witness accounts and testimony (from medics, for example), but also the limitations of an interagency process that requires testing in multiple facilities over the course of several days.45 Practical constraints include the inescapable problem that Syria is an active war zone, and UN inspectors must prioritise both their own personal safety, as well as their mission\u2019s integrity. For instance, the proper handling of evidence and selection of witnesses is a difficult task during any conflict, whether the relevant parties comply or not. No one outside of the select few negotiators, likely not even the UN inspectors themselves, could have been aware what evidence had been supplied by the Syrian Government, opposition force, or external actors such as Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, France, UK, US, and Israel. \nOn the politico-legal front, the Assad government\u2019s obligations were also complex and not altogether as rigid as commonly supposed. Syria was not then a state-party to the international convention banning the use of chemical weapons, though it is party to the 1925 Geneva Convention. Assad was under no legal obligation to facilitate inspections of Syria\u2019s sovereign territory, despite assertions to the contrary based on customary international law.46 In fact, it was Assad who agreed to the inspections by United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons \n44 Tim Aistrope, Conspiracy Theory and American Foreign Policy, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016): 96-97. \n45he Trench, 23 August, 2013. Available at  \n46 Tim Dunne, \u2018Syria and the Laws of War: Permission Accomplished?\u2019 The Interpreter, 27 August 2013. \n14 \nin the Syrian Arab Republic, which had begun to collect evidence about the use of chemical weapons in Syria only a day before the attack.47 Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) offered assistance to components of the UN mission led by Professor \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m. For instance, the mandated UN Sellstr\u00f6m investigation reported in \nDecember 2013 with the narrow conclusion that \u2018chemical weapons had been used\u2019 \u2013including against civilians \u2013 on five occasions between March and August 2013, without any attempt to attribute those attacks to any one party to the conflict.48 It had, however, investigated only seven of sixteen alleged attacks beginning as early as October 2012. Simply put, independent verification of evidence that could attribute any alleged use to any one party to the conflict would be technically and politically difficult to establish, and at any rate was never included in the mandate of any subsequent mission by the OPCW-UN or OPCW.49\nThe point here is that independent reliable evidence on attribution \u2013 which R2P advocates might have relied upon instead of state intelligence \u2013 was not available and, by its very nature, could not have been. Moreover, states publicly attributing the use of chemical weapons to the Syrian government were unwilling or unable to disclose the technical information that would have allowed independent experts to confirm their attribution. According to an advisory opinion from noted chemical weapons specialist J. Perry Robinson: \nWhether the many allegations of Syrian poison-gas warfare are or are not true \ncannot reasonably be judged on the evidence currently in the public domain\u2026 [Furthermore] the several governments which have explicitly accused the Syrian regime of using Sarin nerve-gas against the rebels seem to be withholding evidence that, if disclosed, might make their charges more believable than they are. The gap in disclosure is not so much intelligence from sensitive sources or methodologies but is instead straightforward \n47 Indeed, the team was staying in a hotel just twelve kilometres from the incident site. \n48 United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, Report of the Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons in the Ghouta Area of Damascus on 21 August 2013, Report A/68/663, December 13, 2013, p.2. \n49hich d here:  and ted h\n15 \ndescription for scientific audiences of the procedures that have been used for analysing physiological and environmental samples.50\nAs it turned out, the public case for military intervention made by the UK and US governments did not ultimately withstand high levels of community cynicism about deceptive intelligence around WMDs and Middle-Eastern wars. \nNevertheless, what all this highlights is the danger faced by R2P advocates making a case for intervention in a crisis. In the absence of timely independent attribution there is potential for assumptions based in state intelligence or potentially unreliable media to be acted on. In such an environment, the reticence and scepticism of expert communities is liable to be drowned out by the political momentum and the demand for action. As one chemical weapons specialist, J.P. Zanders sees it: \nInstant judgement does not equal instant justice. It merely satisfies other hidden desires: the dark gratification of being able to Saddam-ise yet another political leader, the clamouring for policy objectives that have little to do with the chemical attacks as such, the uncontrollable eagerness to impart wisdom\u2026 the need to simplify complex realities for a tweeting global audience....51\nThe point here is that the chemical weapons attacks in Syria indicate a problematic dynamic. On the one hand, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally form the basis of an R2P case for military intervention is often unavailable when there is political momentum for action \u2013 or indeed when the prospect of further civilian casualties seems imminent. On the other hand, the information that is available (which inevitably informs the political momentum for action) is routinely produced by state intelligence services \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. Although many R2P advocates supported military intervention in Syria on the proviso that responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks be proven, independent verification was in reality never a possibility. \nPut simply, they could not have reasonably known who committed this heinous act. \nThis section has explored the implication of crisis dynamics that confront R2P advocates. We have established that intelligence, a key source of information \n50 Julian Perry Robinson, 2013. \u2018Alleged Chemical Weapons Use in Syria\u2019, Occasional Paper Series: Harvard Sussex Program 4 (2013): 3. \n51 Zanders, \u2018Syria: Should the UN Investigators Pass Judgement?\u2019. \n16 \nemanating from states, is implicitly (and on some notable occasions, explicitly) shaped by national interest, including the policy goals of its end users. We have suggested that this information is often the most readily available in crisis situations, especially when independent verification can involve complicated and time consuming processes. In the final section we explore the potential consequences of this dynamic and offer a word of caution for R2P advocacy around military intervention. \nR2P Advocacy and the Perception of Pretexts \nOne way to explore the risks associated with unreliable information is situate the different concerns of R2P in relation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances. As we noted earlier, for our purposes the concerns of R2P can be usefully delineated under the headings \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019. The former \nis about \u2018speaking R2P\u2019, which is to say describing a situation as R2P to elevate it within political debates; the later refers to implementing and mainstreaming the prevention strategies of R2P throughout domestic, regional and international infrastructure, which may be done with or without describing it as R2P.52 It is important to reiterate that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather reflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. Of particular interest here is Bellamy\u2019s argument that the rallying cry advocacy for R2P based military intervention has shown limited effectiveness in changing the underlying political dynamic driving international responses to a crisis.53 It follows that rallying cry advocacy may only be effective when the underlying political dynamic are aligned with intervention. Thus, even when states appear to embrace humanitarian arguments for intervention, there is a significant risk that their justification and the information that supports it will be rooted in strategic imperatives. \nRelating this situation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances can highlight the danger for R2P advocates. Two accounts of sovereignty are relevant: de \n52 Stamnes, \u2018Speaking R2P\u2019; Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. It has been argued elsewhere that the framing of \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019 is overly simplistic, as R2P can serve as a \u2018catalyst for debate\u2019 that helps to foreground protection needs, but does not determine a specific course of action (which will depend on multiple normative, strategic and pragmatic factors) Jennifer Welsh, \u2018Norm Contestation and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Global Responsibility to Protect, 5 no. 4 (2013): 365-396. We use the distinction here however, as there was an attempt by advocates to link R2P and chemical weapons use in this case as part of a call to action, in line with the \u2018rallying cry\u2019 framing. \n53 Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. \n17 \njure sovereignty, most familiar tointernationalists and cosmopolitans, points to the norms, practices and social relations that have given meaning to sovereignty over time; de facto Sovereignty, most familiar to classical realists and critical legal scholars, points to the ultimate authority that allows the sovereign to identify a crisis and act decisively to resolve it, and to make rules but not be bound by them, particularly in exceptional circumstances.54 According to Moses; \n[...] while de jure theories of sovereignty find meaning for the term in shared understanding, practices, legitimacy and recognition, de facto theories find sovereignty in the opposite: at points of crisis, misunderstanding, lack of recognition, and, most importantly, in the forceful resolution of these intense political conflicts.55\nOf course, these two accounts are not mutually exclusive: they describe the normative quality and hierarchical character of sovereignty. While sovereignty emerges and is reproduced in social contexts that shape identity and possibilities for action, the ultimate authority of the sovereign in that social context means that norms and regularities that might bind some actors are much more contestable at the apex of political power. At the same time, we can point to the way influential assemblages of norms, practices, rules and historical structures shape, constrain and enable the exercise of sovereign power in palpable ways. \nOn the above delineation, we can associate R2P with de jure sovereignty, to the extent that it seeks to impact the legal and normative dimensions of sovereignty. Conversely, we can associate military intervention with de facto sovereignty, to the \nextent that it is only ever at the point of crisis and the \u2018forceful resolution of intense political conflicts\u2019 that intervention takes place. Understood this way, the vulnerability of rallying cry advocacy is plain. In the crisis moment where the use of force is imminent, when de facto sovereignty is most likely to be enlivened, R2P advocates seek to mobilise the de jure norm of sovereign responsibility. Thus, advocacy for R2P based intervention will often coincide with the powerful assertion \n54 Jeremy Moses, \u2018Sovereignty as Irresponsibility: A Realist Critique of the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Review of International Studies, 39 n. 1 (2013): 113-135. \n55 Ibid, 22-23 \n18 \nof sovereign interest. R2P advocates must therefore be especially careful to insulate against the perception and possibility of de facto sovereign power working through international law and humanitarian pretexts. \nWhile understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates \u2013 particularly where independent attribution of mass atrocity crimes is unavailable \u2013 will entail two significant dangers. First, it will risk undermining the integrity of the R2P intervention. Toni Erskine has recently emphasised the moral imperative of informed decision-making around R2P interventions. Erskine makes this point as part of a broader engagement with the concept of \u2018resultant moral luck\u2019 \u2013 the idea that moral judgement about past events can inadvertently include in the consideration aspects of chance that were beyond the control of any specific actor.56 The primary implication of this concept relates to judgments about moral responsibility. However, Erskine extends the analysis to show how it also imposes strong prospective prudential obligations on moral agents when they make decisions about future actions: \nThis variation on resultant luck speaks to considerations of prospective moral responsibility by reinforcing the imperative to act only when it is possible to offer a fully informed, compelling justification of the decision to do so, which heeds clear precautionary principles and will withstand any result. It also warns of the folly in allowing the morality of a decision to be either held hostage to \u2013 or redeemed by \u2013 fortune.57\nThis analysis suggests there are risks in proceeding with an R2P intervention before \nthere is robust independent evidence to support that course of action. \nSecond, R2P advocates would also risk amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian crisis in pursuit of strategic ends. As Mallavarapu highlights, colonial legacies already leave some states suspicious of the power imbalances involved in military intervention for humanitarian purposes, especially when former colonial powers \u2014 who historically justified their initial conquest in \n56 Toni Erskine, \u2018Moral Responsibility \u2013 and Luck? \u2013 in International Relations\u2019, in Chris Brown and Robyn Eckersley, The Oxford Handbook of International Theory, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). \n57 Ibid, 10. \n19 \nmoral terms \u2014 often lead interventions in their former colonies.58 Bellamy has contested these neo-imperial arguments on the grounds that they deny the consistent support for R2P from many states in the Global South.59 It is certainly the case that African states have shown leadership on R2P as Article 4(h) of the 2000 Constitutive Act of the African Union includes the right to intervene in cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, predating the 2005 World Summit agreement. Whatever the case, the R2P community must be on guard against advocacy that risks undermining the purported impartiality of the R2P doctrine and inviting the perception that states manipulate humanitarian crisis as pretexts in the pursuit of other policies. \nThis perception and possibility may be to some extent unavoidable, but that does not overwhelm R2P as a positive project. Instead, both the risks highlighted above suggest that values of caution and impartiality must underpin any rallying cry advocacy for R2P based intervention. At the same time, it is worth emphasising that the policy agenda aspects of R2P comprise the greater part of the R2P project and remain the most promising avenue for tangible political change. Raising awareness, building early warning systems, and developing regional and international networks for preventative diplomacy, can make very significant contributions towards preventing mass atrocity crimes. Our analysis of the discourse surrounding the Syrian chemical weapons crisis of 2013 indicates that if the legitimacy of R2P based intervention (and R2P more broadly) is to be maintained there must first \u2014 and principally \u2014 be reliable and verified evidence. \nConclusion: Robust evidence as a precondition for R2P legitimacy \nThis article set out to explore the tension between the normative and political content of R2P. We did so by examining the discourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical \n58 Siddharth Mallavarapu, \u2018Colonialism and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, in Ramesh Thakur and William Maley (eds) Theorising the Responsibility to Protect, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015). There is a related literature on the role of non-Western and non-liberal emerging powers in R2P advocacy, see Ramesh Thakur, \u2018R2P after Libya and Syria: Engaging Emerging Powers\u2019, The Washington Quarterly 36 no. 2 (2013): 61\u201376; Hardeep Singh Puri, Perilous Interventions: The Security Council and the Politics of Chaos, (New York: Harper Collins, 2016); Oliver Stuenkel, \u2018Post-Western World: How Emerging Powers Are Remaking Global Order\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 13 February, 2017. One reviewer pointed out the irony that many of these interventions\u2014in Abysinia, Mesapotamia, Manchuria, and Rhodesia, for example\u2014involved chemical weapons in one way or another. 59 Alex J. Bellamy, The Responsibility to Protect: A Defence, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 112-120. \n20 \nweapons attacks of 2013, where humanitarian and security imperatives were drawn together around the use of chemical weapons, historical experience with WMDs introduced a level of suspicion concerning politicisation, and the attribution of the attack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian conflict. We have argued that R2P advocates can be confronted by crisis dynamics where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent and verification of R2P violations. We contrastedthe character of intelligence and media reportage with the technical process of independent attribution and demonstrated that the sort of evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. In this context, we suggested that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception and potential reality that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nAt a minimum, any case for R2P based intervention, whether it is advanced by R2P advocates or states in the context of a UN resolution, needs to be based in robust, impartial and publicly verifiable evidence. We have suggested that on the issue WMD this requires the application of a rigorous and independent attribution process that would not necessarily keep pace with an unfolding crisis or the currents of politics. What is particularly striking in the case we examined is the extent to which the expert community best positioned to contribute to the attribution process was largely side-lined from the political discourse. The sort of robust and impartial case that we argue is a necessity would need to be based not only in a dialogue between expert communities about the facts at hand and the realities of the attribution process, but also in the public availability of basic technical data that could be analysed by multiple independent experts.

Taylor \nAbstract \nThis article explores the problem of attribution in the context of R2P intervention through an analysis of the Syrian chemical weapons attack of 2013. We argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification and attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We contrast the political momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution and show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIntroduction \nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) has been a prominent and sometimes controversial feature of both academic and policy-oriented debates for more than a decade. At times it has seemed as if encounters between R2P advocates and critics have generated more heat than light and that their differences are more irreconcilable than ever. This is no doubt because both advocates and critics are motivated by a genuine attempt to prevent extreme violence directed towards civilians. On the one side, R2P advocates are compelled by the horrific circumstances of mass atrocity crimes, such as those that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica, as well as more recently in Libya and Syria.  On the other side, critics are compelled by a concern that the idea of R2P might be exploited by states as a pretext for politico-strategic objectives, which can escalate, sustain or give rise to further violence. In other words, \n2 \nthe debate largely concerns how best to reconcile the normative and political content \nof R2P. \nIn this article, we attempt to draw a line through this debate by closely examining the \ndiscourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical weapons attacks of 2013.1 This is a \nparticularly useful case for three reasons. First, the issue of chemical weapons \nexplicitly draws security and humanitarian imperatives into the same discursive \nspace\u2014a dynamic captured in the International Relations (IR) literature on the \n\u2018chemical weapons taboo'.2 Second, the framing of chemical weapons as Weapons of \nMass Destruction (WMD) has served to politicise both their actual and potential use, \nparticularly since the 2003 Iraq War. Third, the attribution of the chemical weapons \nattack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian \nconflict. Together, these dynamics make this a useful case for investigating the \nintersection of political and normative imperatives around R2P.3\nWe argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the \npolitical momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification \nand attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We analyse the political discourse after the \nSyrian chemical weapons attack and highlight the way many advocates called for R2P \n1 This collaboration was born out of a desire for dialogue on humanitarian intervention that reaches across sub-disciplinary boundaries \u2014 in this case, security/IR theory (Tim Aistrope), R2P/UN (Jess Gifkins), and arms control and disarmament (N.A.J.

We then contrast the momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution carried out by the United Nations (UN) Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  We show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIn order to make this case, the first section begins by outlining the various claims made about the Syrian chemical weapons incident of 2013. The second section explores the dangers of mobilising political momentum by examining the reliability of evidence provided by states to make the case for military interventions. We do this via \nan analysis of \u2018intelligence\u2019, which is an information product that makes probabilistic estimates about current events and possible futures. We then show that crisis dynamics can incentivise information emanating from states over and above independent attribution. Section three assesses the significance of these insights for the R2P project and identifies some practices that are particularly vulnerable to these crisis dynamics. \nHowever, before we proceed we must first establish the scope of this article, which \nincludes what we mean by \u2018R2P\u2019. Our understanding of R2P draws from the version that was agreed by national leaders in the 2005 World Summit outcome document. Here they were clear that R2P is concerned with four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.4 As such, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described it as \u2018narrow but deep\u2019.5 What this means is that R2P is not synonymous with humanitarian intervention, but encompasses \n4 \nquestions as wide-ranging as inclusive governance and strengthening domestic \nresilience, which can be effective in militating against such crimes.6 This article \ndiscusses the coercive (and contentious) elements of R2P, but we start from the \nunderstanding that this is only one aspect of what R2P involves. \nIt can be helpful then to conceptualise R2P as three pillars \u2013 a frame used by the \nUnited Nations and by most R2P literature currently. The first pillar requires states to \nprotect their own populations from mass atrocity crimes, and applies to all states \nalways. The second pillar envisages a cooperative relationship between states and \nrelevant neighbours, regional organisations and international organisations, whereby \nstates are assisted in providing protection to their peoples.7 Pillar three can involve \nconsensual tools8 such as mediation, peacebuilding and unarmed civilian \npeacekeeping9, as well as coercive tools such as sanctions and peace enforcement \nwhere states have \u2018manifestly failed\u2019 to provide such protection. Unsurprisingly, \npillars one and two are less contentious as they presume only consensual actions. We \nunderstand R2P as a spectrum of activities and tools, aimed at preventing and \nresponding to mass atrocity crimes, which can include both consensual and coercive \nelements. R2P does not equate to humanitarian intervention, despite some who argue \nthat the primary focus of R2P is or should be humanitarian intervention,10 and others \nwho fear that R2P will lead to more use of humanitarian intervention.11\nGiven the many concerns of R2P, we deploy a further delineation in the final section \nof the essay: \u2018policy agenda\u2019 and \u2018rallying cry\u2019.12 The \u2018policy agenda\u2019 heading refers \nto the ideal that effective use of prevention tools will lead to fewer crisis situations \n6 Stephen McLoughlin, The Structural Prevention of Mass Atrocities: Understanding Risk and Resilience (Abingdon: Routledge, 2014). \n7 For discussion on pillar two, see Adrian Gallagher, (2015). \u2018The Promise of Pillar II: Analysing international assistance under the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, International Affairs, 91, no. 6: 1259-1275. \n8 For discussion on the peaceful components of pillar three, see Alex J.

The \u2018rallying \ncry\u2019 focuses on situations where mass atrocity crimes are occurring or foreseeable in \nthe immediate future, and the idea that labelling a crisis an \u2018R2P situation\u2019 can help to \nelevate it above politics as usual to garner a quick and decisive response. It is \nimportant to recognise that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather \nreflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. \nThe R2P agreement outlines the requirement that the use of force has authorisation \nfrom the UN Security Council: as such the R2P agreement does not change \ninternational law. In cases where R2P is used as a rallying cry towards advocacy for \nhumanitarian intervention the decision \u2013 per the R2P agreement \u2013 rests with the UN \nSecurity Council. The Council is a political body, requiring agreement from nine of \nits fifteen members and the agreement (or abstention) of all permanent members, but \nwith few other formal restrictions on its decision-making.13 Legitimacy is central to \nthe ability of the Security Council to wield power.14 As the debates over the Iraq war \nhave demonstrated, credible evidence is intimately bound up with questions of \nlegitimacy over decisions on the use of force. Though evidence is not a legal \nrequirement for a UN Security Council decision (agreement between members is key) \nwe suggest that any proposal for R2P intervention needs to give credible evidence and \nreasons that justify that course of action.15\nAnalyzing the 2013 calls for Intervention \nWe begin by outlining the response from the R2P community to the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria in August 2013, which were described as a \u2018game-changer\u2019 by some \nkey R2P advocates.16 It is first useful to establish the political landscape in which this \nresponse took place. One of the most notable factors was the public statements of the \nObama administration, which adopted a two-pronged strategy of simultaneously \n13 The UN Security Council is bound by the UN Charter (1945) and its Rules of Procedure which remain \n\u2018provisional\u2019. \n14 Ian Hurd, After Anarchy: Legitimacy and Power in the United Nations Security Council, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007). \n15 For discussion on this point, see Antonios Tzanakopoulos, \u2018Strengthening Security Council Accountability for Sanctions: The Role of International Responsibility\u2019, Journal of Conflict & Security Law 19 no. 3 (2014): 409-426. 16 Gareth Evans \u2018R2P down by not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, Open Democracy, 9 September, 2013; Weiss \u2018After Syria, Whither R2P?\u2019, E-International Relations, 2 February, 2014, 36. We use the term R2P advocates throughout in its broadest possible sense, recognizing of course the plurality of perspectives and approaches that inform R2P advocacy. For instance, in sharing our paper at conferences and other forums, one interlocutor was apt to point out that the Foreword to the 2011 ICISS Report detailed the main points of division between the twelve Commissioners.  See ICISS, The Responsibility to Protect: The Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, (Ottawa: International Development Research Centre, 2010) \n6 \nimposing a so-called \u2018red line\u2019 on the deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime (formally issued by the President), as well as the incentive to pre-emptively disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile to avoid military repercussions (informally tabled by the foreign secretary). For instance, speaking at the Whitehouse on August 20 in 2012, Obama was resolute: \n\tWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the \tground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical \tweapons moving around or being utilized.  That would change my \tcalculus.  That would change my equation. [\u2026] We have communicated in no \tuncertain terms with every player in the region that that\u2019s a red line for us and \tthat there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on \tthe chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.  That would \tchange my calculations significantly.17 \nWhile condemnation of any possible use of chemical weapons was to be expected, the response suggested by Obama would require evidence of who was ultimately responsible based on a verified, independent, expert assessment. As events transpired, Obama did not enforce the \u2018red line\u2019 despite the use of forceful strategic and humanitarian arguments. Indeed, a complex set of factors both domestically and internationally combined so that those ends came about by different means. For instance, despite the Cameron government\u2019s arguments for military intervention, the deliberations in the British parliament did not ultimately support that policy, in large part because of heavy reliance in the Joint Intelligence Committee briefing on \u201cintelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources\u201d.18 In other words, there was a gap that need closing between what was known (via robust evidence) and what was merely presumed. At the same time, the Obama administration remained unsure about both the appetite of the Congress to sanction any such military action (especially in light of Britain\u2019s stance), as well as the likely impact it would have on the Iran nuclear deal being negotiated at the time. Former secretary of defence Leon Panetta, for example, has subsequently told The Atlantic that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know it was coming\u201d.19\n17 Office of the Press Secreat \nDay, \u2018Syria: Reported Chemical Weapons Use \u2013 Letter from the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee\u2019, Cabinet Office, 29 August 2013, 1.\n19 Jeffrey Goldberg, \u2018The Day Obama Broke with the Washington War Hawks\u2019, The Atlantic, April 2016. http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/473025/syria-red-line-that-wasnt/. \n7 \nThe relevance of R2P to the conflict in Syria was clear long before August 2013. The \nUN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic \ndocumented concerns that violence in Syria since March 2011 may constitute crimes \nagainst humanity.20 From August 2012 the Commission added to its regular reports \nthat it had reasonable evidence that war crimes had also been committed.21 The \nCommission even stated explicitly that \u201cThe Government has manifestly failed in its \nresponsibility to protect its people\u201d, drawing on language on R2P from the World \nSummit outcome document.22 The perpetration of mass atrocity crimes is not a \n\u2018threshold criteria\u2019 for the applicability of the responsibility to protect \u2013 indeed the \n2005 World Summit is clear that the scope of R2P includes the prevention of such \ncrimes. However, since some commentary behaved as if evidence of the perpetration \nof mass atrocity crimes was a criterion \u2013 and such evidence is key to perceptions of \nlegitimacy \u2013 it is worth recognising that the evidence of both crimes against humanity \nand war crimes was available long before August 2013. The scale of these crimes was \nsuch that a month prior to the chemical weapons attack the Commission reported that \n\u201c[w]ar crimes and crimes against humanity have become a daily reality in the \ncountry\u201d.23 By August, more than 100,000 people had been killed in Syria since the \nconflict began.24\nThere was no doubt that the situation in Syria fit within the purview of R2P, including \npillar three of R2P, with the Syrian government \u2018manifestly failing\u2019 to protect their \npopulation from war crimes and crimes against humanity. The R2P agreement is \nclear, however, that while coercive measures \u2013 including the use of force \u2013 can be \nused, it requires authorisation from the UN Security Council, in line with the UN \nCharter. \nDespite this, media discussion on Syria shifted after the chemical weapons attacks, \nand became more likely to refer to the responsibility to protect. For example, in the \n20 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 23 November, 2011. A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1: 20. \n21 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 16 August, 2012. A/HRC/21/50. \n22 Ibid: 1. \n23 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 18 July, 2013. A/HRC/23/58: 2. \n24 \u2018Syria Death Toll now above 100,000, says UN Chief Ban\u2019, BBC 25 July, 2013. Available at  \n8 \nthree months leading up to the attack on 21 August 2013 there were less than 100 news articles on Syria which referred to the responsibility to protect, yet in the three months after there were over 400 news articles which drew the connection.25 In fact, the year 2013 had more newspaper discussion on the connection between Syria and R2P than any other year to date, with 1172 articles in total, half of which referred to chemical weapons.26 This shows a shift in media discussion of Syria in relation to R2P, beyond the specific statements made by R2P advocates. \nIn addition to the general media increase in discussions linking Syria and R2P, prominent R2P advocates made the argument that military intervention could be an appropriate response provided the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government \ncould be proven. Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock made a strong argument that \u201cR2P can and should be used as the basis for action in Syria\u201d however this was caveated by their requirement that attribution of the Syrian government using chemical weapons be established first.27 After the chemical weapons attack Gareth Evans laid out a moral argument for taking military action against the Syrian government if indeed it had used chemical weapons.28 It is worth pointing out that these three figures are not merely commentators on R2P. Each played key roles in the creation and formalisation of R2P. Axworthy initiated the original Commission which developed the responsibility to protect in his former role as Canada\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister; Rock \nwas Canada\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations during the 2005 World Summit negotiations; and Evans was Co-Chair of the original Commission. The important point here is that these significant R2P advocates saw the use of chemical weapons as a decisive event that made intervention a necessity so long as there was proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator. \nOf course, the attribution of the chemical weapons attack intersected with the political realities of the time. Prior to the chemical weapons attack there was little momentum for military intervention in Syria, whereas afterwards there was a period where \n25 A Factiva search of news articles with the search terms \u2018Syria\u2019 and \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 between 21 May 2013 and 21 November 2013 returned 530 original articles. Of these, 96 were prior to the 21 August chemical weapons attacks and 434 were after. This search was limited to English language news sources. \n26 A Factiva search of news articles by year shows 1171 articles in 2013 that referred to both Syria and the responsibility to protect, with an average of 777 per year in the subsequent 2014-2016 period. \n27 Lloyd Axworth and Allan Rock, \u2018Looking Back at Kosovo can move the Syria Conflict Forward\u2019, The Globe and Mail, 26 August, 2013. \n28Evans, \u2018R2P down but not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, lable at  \n9 \nseveral states and regional actors pushed for the use of force. First, the UK, along with other regional actors opposed to the Assad government, was enthusiastic about a strong military response.29 The chemical weapons attack was positioned as casus belli for intervention. At the same time, the Obama Administration initially sought to avoid direct military engagement in another Middle East crisis and pushed back against reports of chemical weapons use, questioning attribution to forestall further involvement \u2013 before shifting towards intervention under political pressure from allies and domestic partisans.30 Meanwhile, states supportive of the Assad government \u2013 notably Russia and Iran \u2013 questioned the origins of the chemical weapons attacks and identified the Islamic State as an alternative perpetrator, pointing to their alleged use of chemical weapons earlier in the conflict. These states were quick to dismiss the humanitarian dimension of the crisis and framed such claims as a convenient pretext for western intervention.31\nThe point here is that advocacy for R2P intervention arose in a broader geopolitical context that had the potential to influence information about the chemical weapons attacks. R2P advocates may have wanted proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator, but the evidence of attribution available in the crisis moment, as the momentum for intervention gained pace, was potentially problematic. Moreover, these advocates faced strong incentives to take this information seriously, when the case for intervention made by states combined strategic arguments about deterrence and regional stability with humanitarian arguments that connected with the concerns of R2P. Indeed, as we indicated above, the language of R2P was already widely operative in media coverage and political commentary on the chemical weapons attack, often woven together with confident assertions that the Assad government was to blame for the attacks.32 The next section explores the way political dynamics can \n29 Geraint Alun Hughes, \u2018Syria and the Perils of Proxy Warfare, Small Wars & Insurgency\u2019, 25, no. 3 (2014): 522-438. \n30 Michelle Bentley, \u2018Syria and the Chemical Weapons Taboo: Exploiting the Forbidden\u2019, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016); Bentley, \u2018Chemical Weapons Are Being Used in Iraq \u2013 but the US Won\u2019t Raise Hell about It\u2019, The Conversation, September 23, 2016.

Even when the Obama Administration changed tack on intervention, they sought political cover and public sanction by putting the proposal before Congress, rather than relying on executive powers. \n31 Carroll Bog, 26 September, 2013. Available at  Putin, \u2018A Plea for Caution from , New York Times\n32 At the same time, there was a widespread assumption that independent attribution would confirm the Assad regime was behind the attacks. It is certainly the case that any R2P proposal for intervention in Syria was only, at this stage of the conflict, intended to protect Syrian civilians from the Syrian government. \n10 \nshape information provided by state intelligence agencies and the media, then contrast this with the technical process of independent attribution. In this context, we suggest R2P advocates needed to take seriously the question of what counts as proof. \nIntelligence, Attribution and R2P Intervention \nNumerous sources feed into public perception of international crisis. While reporters \n\u2018on the ground\u2019 play an important role, by far the most common channel of information about an international crisis comes from governments. We focus on the special character of \u2018intelligence\u2019 the chief source of information emanating from states to illustrate the way national interest imperatives intersect with the representation of the crisis like the Syrian chemical weapons attack. \nThe starting point for any account of intelligence should be to note that it is geared towards future action and is in that sense concerned with risk management. Faced with an uncertain and often incoherent environment, including enemies that conceal their activities and intentions, and actively seek to mislead, intelligence analysts can only hope to produce \u2018estimates\u2019 or \u2018assessments\u2019 of likely futures, couched in well-rehearsed caveats about probability and inherent limitations.33 Following on from here, it is crucial to recognise that the subjects of intelligence estimates are determined by the risks they may pose to a specific set of interests. Thus, intelligence must be understood as \u2018a system of knowledge in the service of power\u2019.34 It answers questions that are of concern to policy makers and political leaders, the end users of intelligence; the priorities and predispositions of users can influence the way these questions are answered, in terms of emphasis and priority; whatever intelligence is produced will be mobilised towards the user\u2019s strategic ends.35 In this sense, even impartial evidence and informed decision-making is thoroughly structured by national interest imperatives. \nThese structuring interests become much more explicit and influential around the justification of the use of force. As Bruce Berkowitz noted on the eve of Colin \n33 Richard K. Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: Knowledge and Power in American National Security, (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007); Mark M. Lowenthal, Intelligence: From Evidence to Policy, (Washington: CQ Press, 2006); Richard L. Russell, Sharpening Strategic Intelligence, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007). \n34 James Der Derian, \u2018Anti-diplomacy, Intelligence Theory and Surveillance Practice\u2019, Intelligence and National Security,8 no. 3 (1993): 35. \n35 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 66-103; Lowenthal Intelligence: 174-189. \n11 \nPowell\u2019s now notorious presentation to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD), intelligence is sometimes presented as fact \u2014a \u2018slam dunk\u2019 or a \u2018smoking gun\u2019\u2014 to strengthen the credibility of a political claim.36 Paul H. Barratt, former Secretary of the Australian Department of Defence, makes the same point regarding the Howard government\u2019s assertions about Iraqi WMDs: \nThe use of the phrase \u2018the Australian government knows\u2019 was a cardinal sin from the viewpoint of both Australian parliamentary procedure and professionalism in the treatment of intelligence. It admits of no doubt \u2013 this was not just an assessment, the best judgment we could make with the available evidence at the time, it was knowledge. We should not expect a \nsubsequent inquiry to find that evidence was \u2018thin, ambiguous, and \nincomplete\u2019, which was the finding of the inquiry led by former DFAT Secretary Philip Flood.37\nThe point here is that because intelligence is always structured by the interest of its end users, there is real potential for it to be mobilised towards broader strategic ends in ways that misrepresent the underlying estimate. A similar perspective on the Iraqi WMD case is given by Richard K. Betts, an eminent scholar of intelligence theory and practice: \nAlthough the bottom line analytic conclusion was wrong, in the absence of adequate collection it was the proper estimate to make from the intelligence available. No responsible analyst could have concluded in 2002 that Iraq did not have stocks of chemical and biological weapons concealed. The principle mistake was in the confident presentation of the analysis and the failure to make clear how weak the direct evidence was for reaching any conclusion and how much the conclusion depended on the logic of deduction from behaviour.38\nOf course, what Betts leaves out here is that intelligence agencies were placed under enormous pressure by Bush Administration policy makers to produce estimates in support of a certain policy ambitions. In this sense, there was a relationship between \n36 Bruce Berkowitz, \u2018The Big Difference Between Intelligence and Evidence\u2019, Washington Post, February 2, 2003. 37 Paul H. Barratt, \u2018The Case for an Iraq War Inquiry Global Change\u2019, Global Change, Peace and Security, 26 no. 3(2014): 333. \n38 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 115. \n12 \nthe strength of the estimates about Iraqi WMDs and the political context in which \nthose assessments were made.  More broadly, the leaked Downing Street Memo, \nminutes of a top level British Government meeting in July 2002, indicates: \u2018that the \nintelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\u2019.39 Put simply, the decision \nto change the Iraqi regime had already been made and WMDs, as well as ancillary \nhumanitarian arguments, were merely convenient pretexts that could justify the policy \nto the American public and the international community. What this episode indicates \nis the potential for intelligence to be mobilised towards the strategic ends of states. \nAs we noted above, another common source of information about international crisis \nis media reportage. However, the chemical weapons issue should remind us of how \nunreliable the media has been around WMDs.40 For instance, in the lead up to the Iraq \nWar in 2003, New York Times reporter Judith Miller published a series of articles \nasserting that Iraq had WMD and an ongoing active program to produce them. It \nturned out that much of this reporting was based in private briefings from a senior \nBush Administration official who claimed that there was incontrovertible intelligence \nto that effect.41 More broadly, the recent Chilcot Report, the UK government\u2019s inquiry \ninto the Iraq War, makes it clear that a comprehensive media strategy was an integral \npart of the push for war.42\nTo recap then: in the immediate wake of the Syrian chemical weapons incident the \nUK and Arab states asserted that the Assad regime was responsible.43 This claim was \nbased in undisclosed intelligence, the authority of which was mobilised publicly in \ntandem with emotionally charged images of Syrians dead or dying from exposure to \nchemical agents. At the same time, the provenance of the chemical weapons attacks \nwas muddied by competing claims made by other states, for instance, from Russia and \nSyria, as well as journalists, foreign affairs analyst, and the various non-state actors \n39 Mark Danner, \u2018The Secret Way to War\u2019, New York Review of Books 52 no 10 (2005). \n40 Perhaps the best acknowledgement of this fact is the mea culpa delivered by the New York Times about the failures of its pre-war coverage, which points to the way government officials exploited reporters to push the case for war. See The Editors, \u2018The Times and Iraq\u201d, New York Times, 26 May, 2004. \n41 Jack Shaffer, \u2018The Real Problem with Judith Miller\u2019, Politico, April 10, 2015. \n42  The Chicot Report advances a broader critique of the case for war, which is scathing in its assessment of the way intelligence wvailable at  \nAvailable at  As we noted  framework of non-intervention. \n13 \non the Syrian battlefield.44 R2P advocates making the case for intervention were put in a position where the information immediately available was provided by self-interested states and a potentially briefed media, both with a recent history of unreliability around WMD. \nBy contrast, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally have formed the basis for determining responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks was unavailable. This is largely because chemical weapons experts establish attribution through rigorous, transparent and verifiable methodologies focused on the assessment of technical information about the chemical agent and the delivery system in question. There are technical, practical, legal and political hurdles that can constrain a swift outcome. In the context of the Syrian chemical weapons attacks, technical constraints on UN inspections include not only the procurement of evidence, witness accounts and testimony (from medics, for example), but also the limitations of an interagency process that requires testing in multiple facilities over the course of several days.45 Practical constraints include the inescapable problem that Syria is an active war zone, and UN inspectors must prioritise both their own personal safety, as well as their mission\u2019s integrity. For instance, the proper handling of evidence and selection of witnesses is a difficult task during any conflict, whether the relevant parties comply or not. No one outside of the select few negotiators, likely not even the UN inspectors themselves, could have been aware what evidence had been supplied by the Syrian Government, opposition force, or external actors such as Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, France, UK, US, and Israel. \nOn the politico-legal front, the Assad government\u2019s obligations were also complex and not altogether as rigid as commonly supposed. Syria was not then a state-party to the international convention banning the use of chemical weapons, though it is party to the 1925 Geneva Convention. Assad was under no legal obligation to facilitate inspections of Syria\u2019s sovereign territory, despite assertions to the contrary based on customary international law.46 In fact, it was Assad who agreed to the inspections by United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons \n44 Tim Aistrope, Conspiracy Theory and American Foreign Policy, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016): 96-97. \n45he Trench, 23 August, 2013.

For instance, the mandated UN Sellstr\u00f6m investigation reported in \nDecember 2013 with the narrow conclusion that \u2018chemical weapons had been used\u2019 \u2013including against civilians \u2013 on five occasions between March and August 2013, without any attempt to attribute those attacks to any one party to the conflict.48 It had, however, investigated only seven of sixteen alleged attacks beginning as early as October 2012. Simply put, independent verification of evidence that could attribute any alleged use to any one party to the conflict would be technically and politically difficult to establish, and at any rate was never included in the mandate of any subsequent mission by the OPCW-UN or OPCW.49\nThe point here is that independent reliable evidence on attribution \u2013 which R2P advocates might have relied upon instead of state intelligence \u2013 was not available and, by its very nature, could not have been. Moreover, states publicly attributing the use of chemical weapons to the Syrian government were unwilling or unable to disclose the technical information that would have allowed independent experts to confirm their attribution. According to an advisory opinion from noted chemical weapons specialist J. Perry Robinson: \nWhether the many allegations of Syrian poison-gas warfare are or are not true \ncannot reasonably be judged on the evidence currently in the public domain\u2026 [Furthermore] the several governments which have explicitly accused the Syrian regime of using Sarin nerve-gas against the rebels seem to be withholding evidence that, if disclosed, might make their charges more believable than they are. The gap in disclosure is not so much intelligence from sensitive sources or methodologies but is instead straightforward \n47 Indeed, the team was staying in a hotel just twelve kilometres from the incident site. \n48 United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, Report of the Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons in the Ghouta Area of Damascus on 21 August 2013, Report A/68/663, December 13, 2013, p.2. \n49hich d here:  and ted h\n15 \ndescription for scientific audiences of the procedures that have been used for analysing physiological and environmental samples.50\nAs it turned out, the public case for military intervention made by the UK and US governments did not ultimately withstand high levels of community cynicism about deceptive intelligence around WMDs and Middle-Eastern wars. \nNevertheless, what all this highlights is the danger faced by R2P advocates making a case for intervention in a crisis. In the absence of timely independent attribution there is potential for assumptions based in state intelligence or potentially unreliable media to be acted on. In such an environment, the reticence and scepticism of expert communities is liable to be drowned out by the political momentum and the demand for action. As one chemical weapons specialist, J.P. Zanders sees it: \nInstant judgement does not equal instant justice. It merely satisfies other hidden desires: the dark gratification of being able to Saddam-ise yet another political leader, the clamouring for policy objectives that have little to do with the chemical attacks as such, the uncontrollable eagerness to impart wisdom\u2026 the need to simplify complex realities for a tweeting global audience....51\nThe point here is that the chemical weapons attacks in Syria indicate a problematic dynamic. On the one hand, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally form the basis of an R2P case for military intervention is often unavailable when there is political momentum for action \u2013 or indeed when the prospect of further civilian casualties seems imminent. On the other hand, the information that is available (which inevitably informs the political momentum for action) is routinely produced by state intelligence services \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. Although many R2P advocates supported military intervention in Syria on the proviso that responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks be proven, independent verification was in reality never a possibility. \nPut simply, they could not have reasonably known who committed this heinous act. \nThis section has explored the implication of crisis dynamics that confront R2P advocates. We have established that intelligence, a key source of information \n50 Julian Perry Robinson, 2013. \u2018Alleged Chemical Weapons Use in Syria\u2019, Occasional Paper Series: Harvard Sussex Program 4 (2013): 3. \n51 Zanders, \u2018Syria: Should the UN Investigators Pass Judgement?\u2019. \n16 \nemanating from states, is implicitly (and on some notable occasions, explicitly) shaped by national interest, including the policy goals of its end users. We have suggested that this information is often the most readily available in crisis situations, especially when independent verification can involve complicated and time consuming processes. In the final section we explore the potential consequences of this dynamic and offer a word of caution for R2P advocacy around military intervention. \nR2P Advocacy and the Perception of Pretexts \nOne way to explore the risks associated with unreliable information is situate the different concerns of R2P in relation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances. As we noted earlier, for our purposes the concerns of R2P can be usefully delineated under the headings \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019. The former \nis about \u2018speaking R2P\u2019, which is to say describing a situation as R2P to elevate it within political debates; the later refers to implementing and mainstreaming the prevention strategies of R2P throughout domestic, regional and international infrastructure, which may be done with or without describing it as R2P.52 It is important to reiterate that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather reflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. Of particular interest here is Bellamy\u2019s argument that the rallying cry advocacy for R2P based military intervention has shown limited effectiveness in changing the underlying political dynamic driving international responses to a crisis.53 It follows that rallying cry advocacy may only be effective when the underlying political dynamic are aligned with intervention. Thus, even when states appear to embrace humanitarian arguments for intervention, there is a significant risk that their justification and the information that supports it will be rooted in strategic imperatives. \nRelating this situation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances can highlight the danger for R2P advocates. Two accounts of sovereignty are relevant: de \n52 Stamnes, \u2018Speaking R2P\u2019; Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. It has been argued elsewhere that the framing of \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019 is overly simplistic, as R2P can serve as a \u2018catalyst for debate\u2019 that helps to foreground protection needs, but does not determine a specific course of action (which will depend on multiple normative, strategic and pragmatic factors) Jennifer Welsh, \u2018Norm Contestation and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Global Responsibility to Protect, 5 no. 4 (2013): 365-396. We use the distinction here however, as there was an attempt by advocates to link R2P and chemical weapons use in this case as part of a call to action, in line with the \u2018rallying cry\u2019 framing. \n53 Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. \n17 \njure sovereignty, most familiar tointernationalists and cosmopolitans, points to the norms, practices and social relations that have given meaning to sovereignty over time; de facto Sovereignty, most familiar to classical realists and critical legal scholars, points to the ultimate authority that allows the sovereign to identify a crisis and act decisively to resolve it, and to make rules but not be bound by them, particularly in exceptional circumstances.54 According to Moses; \n[...] while de jure theories of sovereignty find meaning for the term in shared understanding, practices, legitimacy and recognition, de facto theories find sovereignty in the opposite: at points of crisis, misunderstanding, lack of recognition, and, most importantly, in the forceful resolution of these intense political conflicts.55\nOf course, these two accounts are not mutually exclusive: they describe the normative quality and hierarchical character of sovereignty. While sovereignty emerges and is reproduced in social contexts that shape identity and possibilities for action, the ultimate authority of the sovereign in that social context means that norms and regularities that might bind some actors are much more contestable at the apex of political power. At the same time, we can point to the way influential assemblages of norms, practices, rules and historical structures shape, constrain and enable the exercise of sovereign power in palpable ways. \nOn the above delineation, we can associate R2P with de jure sovereignty, to the extent that it seeks to impact the legal and normative dimensions of sovereignty. Conversely, we can associate military intervention with de facto sovereignty, to the \nextent that it is only ever at the point of crisis and the \u2018forceful resolution of intense political conflicts\u2019 that intervention takes place. Understood this way, the vulnerability of rallying cry advocacy is plain. In the crisis moment where the use of force is imminent, when de facto sovereignty is most likely to be enlivened, R2P advocates seek to mobilise the de jure norm of sovereign responsibility. Thus, advocacy for R2P based intervention will often coincide with the powerful assertion \n54 Jeremy Moses, \u2018Sovereignty as Irresponsibility: A Realist Critique of the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Review of International Studies, 39 n. 1 (2013): 113-135. \n55 Ibid, 22-23 \n18 \nof sovereign interest. R2P advocates must therefore be especially careful to insulate against the perception and possibility of de facto sovereign power working through international law and humanitarian pretexts. \nWhile understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates \u2013 particularly where independent attribution of mass atrocity crimes is unavailable \u2013 will entail two significant dangers. First, it will risk undermining the integrity of the R2P intervention. Toni Erskine has recently emphasised the moral imperative of informed decision-making around R2P interventions. Erskine makes this point as part of a broader engagement with the concept of \u2018resultant moral luck\u2019 \u2013 the idea that moral judgement about past events can inadvertently include in the consideration aspects of chance that were beyond the control of any specific actor.56 The primary implication of this concept relates to judgments about moral responsibility. However, Erskine extends the analysis to show how it also imposes strong prospective prudential obligations on moral agents when they make decisions about future actions: \nThis variation on resultant luck speaks to considerations of prospective moral responsibility by reinforcing the imperative to act only when it is possible to offer a fully informed, compelling justification of the decision to do so, which heeds clear precautionary principles and will withstand any result. It also warns of the folly in allowing the morality of a decision to be either held hostage to \u2013 or redeemed by \u2013 fortune.57\nThis analysis suggests there are risks in proceeding with an R2P intervention before \nthere is robust independent evidence to support that course of action. \nSecond, R2P advocates would also risk amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian crisis in pursuit of strategic ends. As Mallavarapu highlights, colonial legacies already leave some states suspicious of the power imbalances involved in military intervention for humanitarian purposes, especially when former colonial powers \u2014 who historically justified their initial conquest in \n56 Toni Erskine, \u2018Moral Responsibility \u2013 and Luck? \u2013 in International Relations\u2019, in Chris Brown and Robyn Eckersley, The Oxford Handbook of International Theory, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). \n57 Ibid, 10. \n19 \nmoral terms \u2014 often lead interventions in their former colonies.58 Bellamy has contested these neo-imperial arguments on the grounds that they deny the consistent support for R2P from many states in the Global South.59 It is certainly the case that African states have shown leadership on R2P as Article 4(h) of the 2000 Constitutive Act of the African Union includes the right to intervene in cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, predating the 2005 World Summit agreement. Whatever the case, the R2P community must be on guard against advocacy that risks undermining the purported impartiality of the R2P doctrine and inviting the perception that states manipulate humanitarian crisis as pretexts in the pursuit of other policies. \nThis perception and possibility may be to some extent unavoidable, but that does not overwhelm R2P as a positive project. Instead, both the risks highlighted above suggest that values of caution and impartiality must underpin any rallying cry advocacy for R2P based intervention. At the same time, it is worth emphasising that the policy agenda aspects of R2P comprise the greater part of the R2P project and remain the most promising avenue for tangible political change. Raising awareness, building early warning systems, and developing regional and international networks for preventative diplomacy, can make very significant contributions towards preventing mass atrocity crimes. Our analysis of the discourse surrounding the Syrian chemical weapons crisis of 2013 indicates that if the legitimacy of R2P based intervention (and R2P more broadly) is to be maintained there must first \u2014 and principally \u2014 be reliable and verified evidence. \nConclusion: Robust evidence as a precondition for R2P legitimacy \nThis article set out to explore the tension between the normative and political content of R2P. We did so by examining the discourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical \n58 Siddharth Mallavarapu, \u2018Colonialism and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, in Ramesh Thakur and William Maley (eds) Theorising the Responsibility to Protect, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015). There is a related literature on the role of non-Western and non-liberal emerging powers in R2P advocacy, see Ramesh Thakur, \u2018R2P after Libya and Syria: Engaging Emerging Powers\u2019, The Washington Quarterly 36 no. 2 (2013): 61\u201376; Hardeep Singh Puri, Perilous Interventions: The Security Council and the Politics of Chaos, (New York: Harper Collins, 2016); Oliver Stuenkel, \u2018Post-Western World: How Emerging Powers Are Remaking Global Order\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 13 February, 2017. One reviewer pointed out the irony that many of these interventions\u2014in Abysinia, Mesapotamia, Manchuria, and Rhodesia, for example\u2014involved chemical weapons in one way or another. 59 Alex J. Bellamy, The Responsibility to Protect: A Defence, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 112-120. \n20 \nweapons attacks of 2013, where humanitarian and security imperatives were drawn together around the use of chemical weapons, historical experience with WMDs introduced a level of suspicion concerning politicisation, and the attribution of the attack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian conflict. We have argued that R2P advocates can be confronted by crisis dynamics where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent and verification of R2P violations. We contrastedthe character of intelligence and media reportage with the technical process of independent attribution and demonstrated that the sort of evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. In this context, we suggested that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception and potential reality that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nAt a minimum, any case for R2P based intervention, whether it is advanced by R2P advocates or states in the context of a UN resolution, needs to be based in robust, impartial and publicly verifiable evidence. We have suggested that on the issue WMD this requires the application of a rigorous and independent attribution process that would not necessarily keep pace with an unfolding crisis or the currents of politics. What is particularly striking in the case we examined is the extent to which the expert community best positioned to contribute to the attribution process was largely side-lined from the political discourse. The sort of robust and impartial case that we argue is a necessity would need to be based not only in a dialogue between expert communities about the facts at hand and the realities of the attribution process, but also in the public availability of basic technical data that could be analysed by multiple independent experts.

We argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification and attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We contrast the political momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution and show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIntroduction \nThe Responsibility to Protect (R2P) has been a prominent and sometimes controversial feature of both academic and policy-oriented debates for more than a decade. At times it has seemed as if encounters between R2P advocates and critics have generated more heat than light and that their differences are more irreconcilable than ever. This is no doubt because both advocates and critics are motivated by a genuine attempt to prevent extreme violence directed towards civilians. On the one side, R2P advocates are compelled by the horrific circumstances of mass atrocity crimes, such as those that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica, as well as more recently in Libya and Syria.  On the other side, critics are compelled by a concern that the idea of R2P might be exploited by states as a pretext for politico-strategic objectives, which can escalate, sustain or give rise to further violence. In other words, \n2 \nthe debate largely concerns how best to reconcile the normative and political content \nof R2P. \nIn this article, we attempt to draw a line through this debate by closely examining the \ndiscourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical weapons attacks of 2013.1 This is a \nparticularly useful case for three reasons. First, the issue of chemical weapons \nexplicitly draws security and humanitarian imperatives into the same discursive \nspace\u2014a dynamic captured in the International Relations (IR) literature on the \n\u2018chemical weapons taboo'.2 Second, the framing of chemical weapons as Weapons of \nMass Destruction (WMD) has served to politicise both their actual and potential use, \nparticularly since the 2003 Iraq War. Third, the attribution of the chemical weapons \nattack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian \nconflict. Together, these dynamics make this a useful case for investigating the \nintersection of political and normative imperatives around R2P.3\nWe argue that R2P advocates can be confronted by a crisis dynamic where the \npolitical momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent verification \nand attribution of mass atrocity crimes. We analyse the political discourse after the \nSyrian chemical weapons attack and highlight the way many advocates called for R2P \n1 This collaboration was born out of a desire for dialogue on humanitarian intervention that reaches across sub-disciplinary boundaries \u2014 in this case, security/IR theory (Tim Aistrope), R2P/UN (Jess Gifkins), and arms control and disarmament (N.A.J.

We then contrast the momentum for intervention with the technical process of independent attribution carried out by the United Nations (UN) Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  We show that the sort of independent evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available (which inevitably informed the political momentum for action) was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a potentially briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. While understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining the integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nIn order to make this case, the first section begins by outlining the various claims made about the Syrian chemical weapons incident of 2013. The second section explores the dangers of mobilising political momentum by examining the reliability of evidence provided by states to make the case for military interventions. We do this via \nan analysis of \u2018intelligence\u2019, which is an information product that makes probabilistic estimates about current events and possible futures. We then show that crisis dynamics can incentivise information emanating from states over and above independent attribution. Section three assesses the significance of these insights for the R2P project and identifies some practices that are particularly vulnerable to these crisis dynamics. \nHowever, before we proceed we must first establish the scope of this article, which \nincludes what we mean by \u2018R2P\u2019. Our understanding of R2P draws from the version that was agreed by national leaders in the 2005 World Summit outcome document. Here they were clear that R2P is concerned with four mass atrocity crimes: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.4 As such, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described it as \u2018narrow but deep\u2019.5 What this means is that R2P is not synonymous with humanitarian intervention, but encompasses \n4 \nquestions as wide-ranging as inclusive governance and strengthening domestic \nresilience, which can be effective in militating against such crimes.6 This article \ndiscusses the coercive (and contentious) elements of R2P, but we start from the \nunderstanding that this is only one aspect of what R2P involves. \nIt can be helpful then to conceptualise R2P as three pillars \u2013 a frame used by the \nUnited Nations and by most R2P literature currently. The first pillar requires states to \nprotect their own populations from mass atrocity crimes, and applies to all states \nalways. The second pillar envisages a cooperative relationship between states and \nrelevant neighbours, regional organisations and international organisations, whereby \nstates are assisted in providing protection to their peoples.7 Pillar three can involve \nconsensual tools8 such as mediation, peacebuilding and unarmed civilian \npeacekeeping9, as well as coercive tools such as sanctions and peace enforcement \nwhere states have \u2018manifestly failed\u2019 to provide such protection. Unsurprisingly, \npillars one and two are less contentious as they presume only consensual actions. We \nunderstand R2P as a spectrum of activities and tools, aimed at preventing and \nresponding to mass atrocity crimes, which can include both consensual and coercive \nelements. R2P does not equate to humanitarian intervention, despite some who argue \nthat the primary focus of R2P is or should be humanitarian intervention,10 and others \nwho fear that R2P will lead to more use of humanitarian intervention.11\nGiven the many concerns of R2P, we deploy a further delineation in the final section \nof the essay: \u2018policy agenda\u2019 and \u2018rallying cry\u2019.12 The \u2018policy agenda\u2019 heading refers \nto the ideal that effective use of prevention tools will lead to fewer crisis situations \n6 Stephen McLoughlin, The Structural Prevention of Mass Atrocities: Understanding Risk and Resilience (Abingdon: Routledge, 2014). \n7 For discussion on pillar two, see Adrian Gallagher, (2015). \u2018The Promise of Pillar II: Analysing international assistance under the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, International Affairs, 91, no. 6: 1259-1275. \n8 For discussion on the peaceful components of pillar three, see Alex J.

The \u2018rallying \ncry\u2019 focuses on situations where mass atrocity crimes are occurring or foreseeable in \nthe immediate future, and the idea that labelling a crisis an \u2018R2P situation\u2019 can help to \nelevate it above politics as usual to garner a quick and decisive response. It is \nimportant to recognise that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather \nreflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. \nThe R2P agreement outlines the requirement that the use of force has authorisation \nfrom the UN Security Council: as such the R2P agreement does not change \ninternational law. In cases where R2P is used as a rallying cry towards advocacy for \nhumanitarian intervention the decision \u2013 per the R2P agreement \u2013 rests with the UN \nSecurity Council. The Council is a political body, requiring agreement from nine of \nits fifteen members and the agreement (or abstention) of all permanent members, but \nwith few other formal restrictions on its decision-making.13 Legitimacy is central to \nthe ability of the Security Council to wield power.14 As the debates over the Iraq war \nhave demonstrated, credible evidence is intimately bound up with questions of \nlegitimacy over decisions on the use of force. Though evidence is not a legal \nrequirement for a UN Security Council decision (agreement between members is key) \nwe suggest that any proposal for R2P intervention needs to give credible evidence and \nreasons that justify that course of action.15\nAnalyzing the 2013 calls for Intervention \nWe begin by outlining the response from the R2P community to the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria in August 2013, which were described as a \u2018game-changer\u2019 by some \nkey R2P advocates.16 It is first useful to establish the political landscape in which this \nresponse took place. One of the most notable factors was the public statements of the \nObama administration, which adopted a two-pronged strategy of simultaneously \n13 The UN Security Council is bound by the UN Charter (1945) and its Rules of Procedure which remain \n\u2018provisional\u2019. \n14 Ian Hurd, After Anarchy: Legitimacy and Power in the United Nations Security Council, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007). \n15 For discussion on this point, see Antonios Tzanakopoulos, \u2018Strengthening Security Council Accountability for Sanctions: The Role of International Responsibility\u2019, Journal of Conflict & Security Law 19 no. 3 (2014): 409-426. 16 Gareth Evans \u2018R2P down by not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, Open Democracy, 9 September, 2013; Weiss \u2018After Syria, Whither R2P?\u2019, E-International Relations, 2 February, 2014, 36. We use the term R2P advocates throughout in its broadest possible sense, recognizing of course the plurality of perspectives and approaches that inform R2P advocacy. For instance, in sharing our paper at conferences and other forums, one interlocutor was apt to point out that the Foreword to the 2011 ICISS Report detailed the main points of division between the twelve Commissioners.  See ICISS, The Responsibility to Protect: The Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, (Ottawa: International Development Research Centre, 2010) \n6 \nimposing a so-called \u2018red line\u2019 on the deployment of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime (formally issued by the President), as well as the incentive to pre-emptively disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile to avoid military repercussions (informally tabled by the foreign secretary). For instance, speaking at the Whitehouse on August 20 in 2012, Obama was resolute: \n\tWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the \tground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical \tweapons moving around or being utilized.  That would change my \tcalculus.  That would change my equation. [\u2026] We have communicated in no \tuncertain terms with every player in the region that that\u2019s a red line for us and \tthat there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on \tthe chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons.  That would \tchange my calculations significantly.17 \nWhile condemnation of any possible use of chemical weapons was to be expected, the response suggested by Obama would require evidence of who was ultimately responsible based on a verified, independent, expert assessment. As events transpired, Obama did not enforce the \u2018red line\u2019 despite the use of forceful strategic and humanitarian arguments. Indeed, a complex set of factors both domestically and internationally combined so that those ends came about by different means. For instance, despite the Cameron government\u2019s arguments for military intervention, the deliberations in the British parliament did not ultimately support that policy, in large part because of heavy reliance in the Joint Intelligence Committee briefing on \u201cintelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources\u201d.18 In other words, there was a gap that need closing between what was known (via robust evidence) and what was merely presumed. At the same time, the Obama administration remained unsure about both the appetite of the Congress to sanction any such military action (especially in light of Britain\u2019s stance), as well as the likely impact it would have on the Iran nuclear deal being negotiated at the time. Former secretary of defence Leon Panetta, for example, has subsequently told The Atlantic that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know it was coming\u201d.19\n17 Office of the Press Secreat \nDay, \u2018Syria: Reported Chemical Weapons Use \u2013 Letter from the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee\u2019, Cabinet Office, 29 August 2013, 1.\n19 Jeffrey Goldberg, \u2018The Day Obama Broke with the Washington War Hawks\u2019, The Atlantic, April 2016. http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/473025/syria-red-line-that-wasnt/. \n7 \nThe relevance of R2P to the conflict in Syria was clear long before August 2013. The \nUN\u2019s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic \ndocumented concerns that violence in Syria since March 2011 may constitute crimes \nagainst humanity.20 From August 2012 the Commission added to its regular reports \nthat it had reasonable evidence that war crimes had also been committed.21 The \nCommission even stated explicitly that \u201cThe Government has manifestly failed in its \nresponsibility to protect its people\u201d, drawing on language on R2P from the World \nSummit outcome document.22 The perpetration of mass atrocity crimes is not a \n\u2018threshold criteria\u2019 for the applicability of the responsibility to protect \u2013 indeed the \n2005 World Summit is clear that the scope of R2P includes the prevention of such \ncrimes. However, since some commentary behaved as if evidence of the perpetration \nof mass atrocity crimes was a criterion \u2013 and such evidence is key to perceptions of \nlegitimacy \u2013 it is worth recognising that the evidence of both crimes against humanity \nand war crimes was available long before August 2013. The scale of these crimes was \nsuch that a month prior to the chemical weapons attack the Commission reported that \n\u201c[w]ar crimes and crimes against humanity have become a daily reality in the \ncountry\u201d.23 By August, more than 100,000 people had been killed in Syria since the \nconflict began.24\nThere was no doubt that the situation in Syria fit within the purview of R2P, including \npillar three of R2P, with the Syrian government \u2018manifestly failing\u2019 to protect their \npopulation from war crimes and crimes against humanity. The R2P agreement is \nclear, however, that while coercive measures \u2013 including the use of force \u2013 can be \nused, it requires authorisation from the UN Security Council, in line with the UN \nCharter. \nDespite this, media discussion on Syria shifted after the chemical weapons attacks, \nand became more likely to refer to the responsibility to protect. For example, in the \n20 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 23 November, 2011. A/HRC/S-17/2/Add.1: 20. \n21 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 16 August, 2012. A/HRC/21/50. \n22 Ibid: 1. \n23 United Nations, \u2018Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019, Human Rights Council, 18 July, 2013. A/HRC/23/58: 2. \n24 \u2018Syria Death Toll now above 100,000, says UN Chief Ban\u2019, BBC 25 July, 2013. Available at  \n8 \nthree months leading up to the attack on 21 August 2013 there were less than 100 news articles on Syria which referred to the responsibility to protect, yet in the three months after there were over 400 news articles which drew the connection.25 In fact, the year 2013 had more newspaper discussion on the connection between Syria and R2P than any other year to date, with 1172 articles in total, half of which referred to chemical weapons.26 This shows a shift in media discussion of Syria in relation to R2P, beyond the specific statements made by R2P advocates. \nIn addition to the general media increase in discussions linking Syria and R2P, prominent R2P advocates made the argument that military intervention could be an appropriate response provided the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government \ncould be proven. Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock made a strong argument that \u201cR2P can and should be used as the basis for action in Syria\u201d however this was caveated by their requirement that attribution of the Syrian government using chemical weapons be established first.27 After the chemical weapons attack Gareth Evans laid out a moral argument for taking military action against the Syrian government if indeed it had used chemical weapons.28 It is worth pointing out that these three figures are not merely commentators on R2P. Each played key roles in the creation and formalisation of R2P. Axworthy initiated the original Commission which developed the responsibility to protect in his former role as Canada\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister; Rock \nwas Canada\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations during the 2005 World Summit negotiations; and Evans was Co-Chair of the original Commission. The important point here is that these significant R2P advocates saw the use of chemical weapons as a decisive event that made intervention a necessity so long as there was proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator. \nOf course, the attribution of the chemical weapons attack intersected with the political realities of the time. Prior to the chemical weapons attack there was little momentum for military intervention in Syria, whereas afterwards there was a period where \n25 A Factiva search of news articles with the search terms \u2018Syria\u2019 and \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 between 21 May 2013 and 21 November 2013 returned 530 original articles. Of these, 96 were prior to the 21 August chemical weapons attacks and 434 were after. This search was limited to English language news sources. \n26 A Factiva search of news articles by year shows 1171 articles in 2013 that referred to both Syria and the responsibility to protect, with an average of 777 per year in the subsequent 2014-2016 period. \n27 Lloyd Axworth and Allan Rock, \u2018Looking Back at Kosovo can move the Syria Conflict Forward\u2019, The Globe and Mail, 26 August, 2013. \n28Evans, \u2018R2P down but not out after Libya and Syria\u2019, lable at  \n9 \nseveral states and regional actors pushed for the use of force. First, the UK, along with other regional actors opposed to the Assad government, was enthusiastic about a strong military response.29 The chemical weapons attack was positioned as casus belli for intervention. At the same time, the Obama Administration initially sought to avoid direct military engagement in another Middle East crisis and pushed back against reports of chemical weapons use, questioning attribution to forestall further involvement \u2013 before shifting towards intervention under political pressure from allies and domestic partisans.30 Meanwhile, states supportive of the Assad government \u2013 notably Russia and Iran \u2013 questioned the origins of the chemical weapons attacks and identified the Islamic State as an alternative perpetrator, pointing to their alleged use of chemical weapons earlier in the conflict. These states were quick to dismiss the humanitarian dimension of the crisis and framed such claims as a convenient pretext for western intervention.31\nThe point here is that advocacy for R2P intervention arose in a broader geopolitical context that had the potential to influence information about the chemical weapons attacks. R2P advocates may have wanted proof that the Syrian government was the perpetrator, but the evidence of attribution available in the crisis moment, as the momentum for intervention gained pace, was potentially problematic. Moreover, these advocates faced strong incentives to take this information seriously, when the case for intervention made by states combined strategic arguments about deterrence and regional stability with humanitarian arguments that connected with the concerns of R2P. Indeed, as we indicated above, the language of R2P was already widely operative in media coverage and political commentary on the chemical weapons attack, often woven together with confident assertions that the Assad government was to blame for the attacks.32 The next section explores the way political dynamics can \n29 Geraint Alun Hughes, \u2018Syria and the Perils of Proxy Warfare, Small Wars & Insurgency\u2019, 25, no. 3 (2014): 522-438. \n30 Michelle Bentley, \u2018Syria and the Chemical Weapons Taboo: Exploiting the Forbidden\u2019, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016); Bentley, \u2018Chemical Weapons Are Being Used in Iraq \u2013 but the US Won\u2019t Raise Hell about It\u2019, The Conversation, September 23, 2016.

Even when the Obama Administration changed tack on intervention, they sought political cover and public sanction by putting the proposal before Congress, rather than relying on executive powers. \n31 Carroll Bog, 26 September, 2013. Available at  Putin, \u2018A Plea for Caution from , New York Times\n32 At the same time, there was a widespread assumption that independent attribution would confirm the Assad regime was behind the attacks. It is certainly the case that any R2P proposal for intervention in Syria was only, at this stage of the conflict, intended to protect Syrian civilians from the Syrian government. \n10 \nshape information provided by state intelligence agencies and the media, then contrast this with the technical process of independent attribution. In this context, we suggest R2P advocates needed to take seriously the question of what counts as proof. \nIntelligence, Attribution and R2P Intervention \nNumerous sources feed into public perception of international crisis. While reporters \n\u2018on the ground\u2019 play an important role, by far the most common channel of information about an international crisis comes from governments. We focus on the special character of \u2018intelligence\u2019 the chief source of information emanating from states to illustrate the way national interest imperatives intersect with the representation of the crisis like the Syrian chemical weapons attack. \nThe starting point for any account of intelligence should be to note that it is geared towards future action and is in that sense concerned with risk management. Faced with an uncertain and often incoherent environment, including enemies that conceal their activities and intentions, and actively seek to mislead, intelligence analysts can only hope to produce \u2018estimates\u2019 or \u2018assessments\u2019 of likely futures, couched in well-rehearsed caveats about probability and inherent limitations.33 Following on from here, it is crucial to recognise that the subjects of intelligence estimates are determined by the risks they may pose to a specific set of interests. Thus, intelligence must be understood as \u2018a system of knowledge in the service of power\u2019.34 It answers questions that are of concern to policy makers and political leaders, the end users of intelligence; the priorities and predispositions of users can influence the way these questions are answered, in terms of emphasis and priority; whatever intelligence is produced will be mobilised towards the user\u2019s strategic ends.35 In this sense, even impartial evidence and informed decision-making is thoroughly structured by national interest imperatives. \nThese structuring interests become much more explicit and influential around the justification of the use of force. As Bruce Berkowitz noted on the eve of Colin \n33 Richard K. Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: Knowledge and Power in American National Security, (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007); Mark M. Lowenthal, Intelligence: From Evidence to Policy, (Washington: CQ Press, 2006); Richard L. Russell, Sharpening Strategic Intelligence, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007). \n34 James Der Derian, \u2018Anti-diplomacy, Intelligence Theory and Surveillance Practice\u2019, Intelligence and National Security,8 no. 3 (1993): 35. \n35 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 66-103; Lowenthal Intelligence: 174-189. \n11 \nPowell\u2019s now notorious presentation to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD), intelligence is sometimes presented as fact \u2014a \u2018slam dunk\u2019 or a \u2018smoking gun\u2019\u2014 to strengthen the credibility of a political claim.36 Paul H. Barratt, former Secretary of the Australian Department of Defence, makes the same point regarding the Howard government\u2019s assertions about Iraqi WMDs: \nThe use of the phrase \u2018the Australian government knows\u2019 was a cardinal sin from the viewpoint of both Australian parliamentary procedure and professionalism in the treatment of intelligence. It admits of no doubt \u2013 this was not just an assessment, the best judgment we could make with the available evidence at the time, it was knowledge. We should not expect a \nsubsequent inquiry to find that evidence was \u2018thin, ambiguous, and \nincomplete\u2019, which was the finding of the inquiry led by former DFAT Secretary Philip Flood.37\nThe point here is that because intelligence is always structured by the interest of its end users, there is real potential for it to be mobilised towards broader strategic ends in ways that misrepresent the underlying estimate. A similar perspective on the Iraqi WMD case is given by Richard K. Betts, an eminent scholar of intelligence theory and practice: \nAlthough the bottom line analytic conclusion was wrong, in the absence of adequate collection it was the proper estimate to make from the intelligence available. No responsible analyst could have concluded in 2002 that Iraq did not have stocks of chemical and biological weapons concealed. The principle mistake was in the confident presentation of the analysis and the failure to make clear how weak the direct evidence was for reaching any conclusion and how much the conclusion depended on the logic of deduction from behaviour.38\nOf course, what Betts leaves out here is that intelligence agencies were placed under enormous pressure by Bush Administration policy makers to produce estimates in support of a certain policy ambitions. In this sense, there was a relationship between \n36 Bruce Berkowitz, \u2018The Big Difference Between Intelligence and Evidence\u2019, Washington Post, February 2, 2003. 37 Paul H. Barratt, \u2018The Case for an Iraq War Inquiry Global Change\u2019, Global Change, Peace and Security, 26 no. 3(2014): 333. \n38 Betts, Enemies of Intelligence: 115. \n12 \nthe strength of the estimates about Iraqi WMDs and the political context in which \nthose assessments were made.  More broadly, the leaked Downing Street Memo, \nminutes of a top level British Government meeting in July 2002, indicates: \u2018that the \nintelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy\u2019.39 Put simply, the decision \nto change the Iraqi regime had already been made and WMDs, as well as ancillary \nhumanitarian arguments, were merely convenient pretexts that could justify the policy \nto the American public and the international community. What this episode indicates \nis the potential for intelligence to be mobilised towards the strategic ends of states. \nAs we noted above, another common source of information about international crisis \nis media reportage. However, the chemical weapons issue should remind us of how \nunreliable the media has been around WMDs.40 For instance, in the lead up to the Iraq \nWar in 2003, New York Times reporter Judith Miller published a series of articles \nasserting that Iraq had WMD and an ongoing active program to produce them. It \nturned out that much of this reporting was based in private briefings from a senior \nBush Administration official who claimed that there was incontrovertible intelligence \nto that effect.41 More broadly, the recent Chilcot Report, the UK government\u2019s inquiry \ninto the Iraq War, makes it clear that a comprehensive media strategy was an integral \npart of the push for war.42\nTo recap then: in the immediate wake of the Syrian chemical weapons incident the \nUK and Arab states asserted that the Assad regime was responsible.43 This claim was \nbased in undisclosed intelligence, the authority of which was mobilised publicly in \ntandem with emotionally charged images of Syrians dead or dying from exposure to \nchemical agents. At the same time, the provenance of the chemical weapons attacks \nwas muddied by competing claims made by other states, for instance, from Russia and \nSyria, as well as journalists, foreign affairs analyst, and the various non-state actors \n39 Mark Danner, \u2018The Secret Way to War\u2019, New York Review of Books 52 no 10 (2005). \n40 Perhaps the best acknowledgement of this fact is the mea culpa delivered by the New York Times about the failures of its pre-war coverage, which points to the way government officials exploited reporters to push the case for war. See The Editors, \u2018The Times and Iraq\u201d, New York Times, 26 May, 2004. \n41 Jack Shaffer, \u2018The Real Problem with Judith Miller\u2019, Politico, April 10, 2015. \n42  The Chicot Report advances a broader critique of the case for war, which is scathing in its assessment of the way intelligence wvailable at  \nAvailable at  As we noted  framework of non-intervention. \n13 \non the Syrian battlefield.44 R2P advocates making the case for intervention were put in a position where the information immediately available was provided by self-interested states and a potentially briefed media, both with a recent history of unreliability around WMD. \nBy contrast, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally have formed the basis for determining responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks was unavailable. This is largely because chemical weapons experts establish attribution through rigorous, transparent and verifiable methodologies focused on the assessment of technical information about the chemical agent and the delivery system in question. There are technical, practical, legal and political hurdles that can constrain a swift outcome. In the context of the Syrian chemical weapons attacks, technical constraints on UN inspections include not only the procurement of evidence, witness accounts and testimony (from medics, for example), but also the limitations of an interagency process that requires testing in multiple facilities over the course of several days.45 Practical constraints include the inescapable problem that Syria is an active war zone, and UN inspectors must prioritise both their own personal safety, as well as their mission\u2019s integrity. For instance, the proper handling of evidence and selection of witnesses is a difficult task during any conflict, whether the relevant parties comply or not. No one outside of the select few negotiators, likely not even the UN inspectors themselves, could have been aware what evidence had been supplied by the Syrian Government, opposition force, or external actors such as Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, France, UK, US, and Israel. \nOn the politico-legal front, the Assad government\u2019s obligations were also complex and not altogether as rigid as commonly supposed. Syria was not then a state-party to the international convention banning the use of chemical weapons, though it is party to the 1925 Geneva Convention. Assad was under no legal obligation to facilitate inspections of Syria\u2019s sovereign territory, despite assertions to the contrary based on customary international law.46 In fact, it was Assad who agreed to the inspections by United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons \n44 Tim Aistrope, Conspiracy Theory and American Foreign Policy, (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016): 96-97. \n45he Trench, 23 August, 2013. Available at  \n46 Tim Dunne, \u2018Syria and the Laws of War: Permission Accomplished?\u2019 The Interpreter, 27 August 2013. \n14 \nin the Syrian Arab Republic, which had begun to collect evidence about the use of chemical weapons in Syria only a day before the attack.47 Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) offered assistance to components of the UN mission led by Professor \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m. For instance, the mandated UN Sellstr\u00f6m investigation reported in \nDecember 2013 with the narrow conclusion that \u2018chemical weapons had been used\u2019 \u2013including against civilians \u2013 on five occasions between March and August 2013, without any attempt to attribute those attacks to any one party to the conflict.48 It had, however, investigated only seven of sixteen alleged attacks beginning as early as October 2012. Simply put, independent verification of evidence that could attribute any alleged use to any one party to the conflict would be technically and politically difficult to establish, and at any rate was never included in the mandate of any subsequent mission by the OPCW-UN or OPCW.49\nThe point here is that independent reliable evidence on attribution \u2013 which R2P advocates might have relied upon instead of state intelligence \u2013 was not available and, by its very nature, could not have been. Moreover, states publicly attributing the use of chemical weapons to the Syrian government were unwilling or unable to disclose the technical information that would have allowed independent experts to confirm their attribution. According to an advisory opinion from noted chemical weapons specialist J. Perry Robinson: \nWhether the many allegations of Syrian poison-gas warfare are or are not true \ncannot reasonably be judged on the evidence currently in the public domain\u2026 [Furthermore] the several governments which have explicitly accused the Syrian regime of using Sarin nerve-gas against the rebels seem to be withholding evidence that, if disclosed, might make their charges more believable than they are. The gap in disclosure is not so much intelligence from sensitive sources or methodologies but is instead straightforward \n47 Indeed, the team was staying in a hotel just twelve kilometres from the incident site. \n48 United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, Report of the Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons in the Ghouta Area of Damascus on 21 August 2013, Report A/68/663, December 13, 2013, p.2. \n49hich d here:  and ted h\n15 \ndescription for scientific audiences of the procedures that have been used for analysing physiological and environmental samples.50\nAs it turned out, the public case for military intervention made by the UK and US governments did not ultimately withstand high levels of community cynicism about deceptive intelligence around WMDs and Middle-Eastern wars. \nNevertheless, what all this highlights is the danger faced by R2P advocates making a case for intervention in a crisis. In the absence of timely independent attribution there is potential for assumptions based in state intelligence or potentially unreliable media to be acted on. In such an environment, the reticence and scepticism of expert communities is liable to be drowned out by the political momentum and the demand for action. As one chemical weapons specialist, J.P. Zanders sees it: \nInstant judgement does not equal instant justice. It merely satisfies other hidden desires: the dark gratification of being able to Saddam-ise yet another political leader, the clamouring for policy objectives that have little to do with the chemical attacks as such, the uncontrollable eagerness to impart wisdom\u2026 the need to simplify complex realities for a tweeting global audience....51\nThe point here is that the chemical weapons attacks in Syria indicate a problematic dynamic. On the one hand, the sort of robust independent evidence that would ideally form the basis of an R2P case for military intervention is often unavailable when there is political momentum for action \u2013 or indeed when the prospect of further civilian casualties seems imminent. On the other hand, the information that is available (which inevitably informs the political momentum for action) is routinely produced by state intelligence services \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. Although many R2P advocates supported military intervention in Syria on the proviso that responsibility for the chemical weapons attacks be proven, independent verification was in reality never a possibility. \nPut simply, they could not have reasonably known who committed this heinous act. \nThis section has explored the implication of crisis dynamics that confront R2P advocates. We have established that intelligence, a key source of information \n50 Julian Perry Robinson, 2013. \u2018Alleged Chemical Weapons Use in Syria\u2019, Occasional Paper Series: Harvard Sussex Program 4 (2013): 3. \n51 Zanders, \u2018Syria: Should the UN Investigators Pass Judgement?\u2019. \n16 \nemanating from states, is implicitly (and on some notable occasions, explicitly) shaped by national interest, including the policy goals of its end users. We have suggested that this information is often the most readily available in crisis situations, especially when independent verification can involve complicated and time consuming processes. In the final section we explore the potential consequences of this dynamic and offer a word of caution for R2P advocacy around military intervention. \nR2P Advocacy and the Perception of Pretexts \nOne way to explore the risks associated with unreliable information is situate the different concerns of R2P in relation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances. As we noted earlier, for our purposes the concerns of R2P can be usefully delineated under the headings \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019. The former \nis about \u2018speaking R2P\u2019, which is to say describing a situation as R2P to elevate it within political debates; the later refers to implementing and mainstreaming the prevention strategies of R2P throughout domestic, regional and international infrastructure, which may be done with or without describing it as R2P.52 It is important to reiterate that these categories are not mutually exclusive, but rather reflect different aspects of the R2P doctrine. Of particular interest here is Bellamy\u2019s argument that the rallying cry advocacy for R2P based military intervention has shown limited effectiveness in changing the underlying political dynamic driving international responses to a crisis.53 It follows that rallying cry advocacy may only be effective when the underlying political dynamic are aligned with intervention. Thus, even when states appear to embrace humanitarian arguments for intervention, there is a significant risk that their justification and the information that supports it will be rooted in strategic imperatives. \nRelating this situation to the dynamics of sovereignty in crisis circumstances can highlight the danger for R2P advocates. Two accounts of sovereignty are relevant: de \n52 Stamnes, \u2018Speaking R2P\u2019; Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. It has been argued elsewhere that the framing of \u2018rallying cry\u2019 and \u2018policy agenda\u2019 is overly simplistic, as R2P can serve as a \u2018catalyst for debate\u2019 that helps to foreground protection needs, but does not determine a specific course of action (which will depend on multiple normative, strategic and pragmatic factors) Jennifer Welsh, \u2018Norm Contestation and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Global Responsibility to Protect, 5 no. 4 (2013): 365-396. We use the distinction here however, as there was an attempt by advocates to link R2P and chemical weapons use in this case as part of a call to action, in line with the \u2018rallying cry\u2019 framing. \n53 Bellamy, \u2018The Responsibility to Protect \u2013 five years on\u2019. \n17 \njure sovereignty, most familiar tointernationalists and cosmopolitans, points to the norms, practices and social relations that have given meaning to sovereignty over time; de facto Sovereignty, most familiar to classical realists and critical legal scholars, points to the ultimate authority that allows the sovereign to identify a crisis and act decisively to resolve it, and to make rules but not be bound by them, particularly in exceptional circumstances.54 According to Moses; \n[...] while de jure theories of sovereignty find meaning for the term in shared understanding, practices, legitimacy and recognition, de facto theories find sovereignty in the opposite: at points of crisis, misunderstanding, lack of recognition, and, most importantly, in the forceful resolution of these intense political conflicts.55\nOf course, these two accounts are not mutually exclusive: they describe the normative quality and hierarchical character of sovereignty. While sovereignty emerges and is reproduced in social contexts that shape identity and possibilities for action, the ultimate authority of the sovereign in that social context means that norms and regularities that might bind some actors are much more contestable at the apex of political power. At the same time, we can point to the way influential assemblages of norms, practices, rules and historical structures shape, constrain and enable the exercise of sovereign power in palpable ways. \nOn the above delineation, we can associate R2P with de jure sovereignty, to the extent that it seeks to impact the legal and normative dimensions of sovereignty. Conversely, we can associate military intervention with de facto sovereignty, to the \nextent that it is only ever at the point of crisis and the \u2018forceful resolution of intense political conflicts\u2019 that intervention takes place. Understood this way, the vulnerability of rallying cry advocacy is plain. In the crisis moment where the use of force is imminent, when de facto sovereignty is most likely to be enlivened, R2P advocates seek to mobilise the de jure norm of sovereign responsibility. Thus, advocacy for R2P based intervention will often coincide with the powerful assertion \n54 Jeremy Moses, \u2018Sovereignty as Irresponsibility: A Realist Critique of the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, Review of International Studies, 39 n. 1 (2013): 113-135. \n55 Ibid, 22-23 \n18 \nof sovereign interest. R2P advocates must therefore be especially careful to insulate against the perception and possibility of de facto sovereign power working through international law and humanitarian pretexts. \nWhile understandable in the face of the \u2018extreme\u2019, we suggest that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates \u2013 particularly where independent attribution of mass atrocity crimes is unavailable \u2013 will entail two significant dangers. First, it will risk undermining the integrity of the R2P intervention. Toni Erskine has recently emphasised the moral imperative of informed decision-making around R2P interventions. Erskine makes this point as part of a broader engagement with the concept of \u2018resultant moral luck\u2019 \u2013 the idea that moral judgement about past events can inadvertently include in the consideration aspects of chance that were beyond the control of any specific actor.56 The primary implication of this concept relates to judgments about moral responsibility. However, Erskine extends the analysis to show how it also imposes strong prospective prudential obligations on moral agents when they make decisions about future actions: \nThis variation on resultant luck speaks to considerations of prospective moral responsibility by reinforcing the imperative to act only when it is possible to offer a fully informed, compelling justification of the decision to do so, which heeds clear precautionary principles and will withstand any result. It also warns of the folly in allowing the morality of a decision to be either held hostage to \u2013 or redeemed by \u2013 fortune.57\nThis analysis suggests there are risks in proceeding with an R2P intervention before \nthere is robust independent evidence to support that course of action. \nSecond, R2P advocates would also risk amplifying the perception that states sometimes exploit humanitarian crisis in pursuit of strategic ends. As Mallavarapu highlights, colonial legacies already leave some states suspicious of the power imbalances involved in military intervention for humanitarian purposes, especially when former colonial powers \u2014 who historically justified their initial conquest in \n56 Toni Erskine, \u2018Moral Responsibility \u2013 and Luck? \u2013 in International Relations\u2019, in Chris Brown and Robyn Eckersley, The Oxford Handbook of International Theory, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). \n57 Ibid, 10. \n19 \nmoral terms \u2014 often lead interventions in their former colonies.58 Bellamy has contested these neo-imperial arguments on the grounds that they deny the consistent support for R2P from many states in the Global South.59 It is certainly the case that African states have shown leadership on R2P as Article 4(h) of the 2000 Constitutive Act of the African Union includes the right to intervene in cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, predating the 2005 World Summit agreement. Whatever the case, the R2P community must be on guard against advocacy that risks undermining the purported impartiality of the R2P doctrine and inviting the perception that states manipulate humanitarian crisis as pretexts in the pursuit of other policies. \nThis perception and possibility may be to some extent unavoidable, but that does not overwhelm R2P as a positive project. Instead, both the risks highlighted above suggest that values of caution and impartiality must underpin any rallying cry advocacy for R2P based intervention. At the same time, it is worth emphasising that the policy agenda aspects of R2P comprise the greater part of the R2P project and remain the most promising avenue for tangible political change. Raising awareness, building early warning systems, and developing regional and international networks for preventative diplomacy, can make very significant contributions towards preventing mass atrocity crimes. Our analysis of the discourse surrounding the Syrian chemical weapons crisis of 2013 indicates that if the legitimacy of R2P based intervention (and R2P more broadly) is to be maintained there must first \u2014 and principally \u2014 be reliable and verified evidence. \nConclusion: Robust evidence as a precondition for R2P legitimacy \nThis article set out to explore the tension between the normative and political content of R2P. We did so by examining the discourse that surrounded the Syrian chemical \n58 Siddharth Mallavarapu, \u2018Colonialism and the Responsibility to Protect\u2019, in Ramesh Thakur and William Maley (eds) Theorising the Responsibility to Protect, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015). There is a related literature on the role of non-Western and non-liberal emerging powers in R2P advocacy, see Ramesh Thakur, \u2018R2P after Libya and Syria: Engaging Emerging Powers\u2019, The Washington Quarterly 36 no. 2 (2013): 61\u201376; Hardeep Singh Puri, Perilous Interventions: The Security Council and the Politics of Chaos, (New York: Harper Collins, 2016); Oliver Stuenkel, \u2018Post-Western World: How Emerging Powers Are Remaking Global Order\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 13 February, 2017. One reviewer pointed out the irony that many of these interventions\u2014in Abysinia, Mesapotamia, Manchuria, and Rhodesia, for example\u2014involved chemical weapons in one way or another. 59 Alex J. Bellamy, The Responsibility to Protect: A Defence, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 112-120. \n20 \nweapons attacks of 2013, where humanitarian and security imperatives were drawn together around the use of chemical weapons, historical experience with WMDs introduced a level of suspicion concerning politicisation, and the attribution of the attack was contested in ways that reflected the geopolitical structure of the Syrian conflict. We have argued that R2P advocates can be confronted by crisis dynamics where the political momentum for military intervention runs ahead of independent and verification of R2P violations. We contrastedthe character of intelligence and media reportage with the technical process of independent attribution and demonstrated that the sort of evidence that would ideally legitimize an R2P intervention was unavailable when there was political momentum for action. Conversely, the information that was available was largely produced by state intelligence organisations \u2013 or a briefed media \u2013 and shaped by the interests and priorities of its end users. In this context, we suggested that the mobilisation of political momentum by R2P advocates entails significant dangers: first, it risks undermining integrity of R2P if evidence is later discredited; and, second, it risks amplifying the perception and potential reality that states sometimes exploit humanitarian pretexts in pursuit of other strategic ends. \nAt a minimum, any case for R2P based intervention, whether it is advanced by R2P advocates or states in the context of a UN resolution, needs to be based in robust, impartial and publicly verifiable evidence. We have suggested that on the issue WMD this requires the application of a rigorous and independent attribution process that would not necessarily keep pace with an unfolding crisis or the currents of politics. What is particularly striking in the case we examined is the extent to which the expert community best positioned to contribute to the attribution process was largely side-lined from the political discourse. The sort of robust and impartial case that we argue is a necessity would need to be based not only in a dialogue between expert communities about the facts at hand and the realities of the attribution process, but also in the public availability of basic technical data that could be analysed by multiple independent experts.

The proliferation of technology and widespread internet usage has made electronic evidence (E-Evidence) and Cyber Forensics pivotal in combatting cybercrimes. This shift presents a significant challenge for law enforcement and legal professionals as cyber criminals exploit the virtual landscape for illicit activities. \nE-Evidence encompasses a broad spectrum of digital data, such as emails, instant messages, social media interactions, cloud storage, and browsing history. Cyber Forensics involves the scientific examination and analysis of this digital evidence to unravel cybercrimes. \nThis paper delves into the core principles of Cyber Forensics, including the identification, preservation, extraction, and analysis of digital evidence while ensuring its integrity and admissibility in court. Despite cybercriminals attempting to conceal their digital footprints, forensic investigators employ tools and methodologies to trace events and identify perpetrators. Additionally, the paper explores legal challenges and ethical dilemmas surrounding E-Evidence and Cyber Forensics. Privacy concerns, maintaining chain of custody, and adhering to data protection laws significantly impact the admissibility and trustworthiness of digital evidence in court. The evolving technological landscape necessitates continual updates to legal frameworks to accommodate digital investigations. \nE-Evidence and Cyber Forensic techniques are indispensable in combatting cybercrimes. As cyber threats evolve, ongoing research and innovation in this field are crucial. Integrating technology, law, and forensics effectively empowers society to proactively tackle cybercriminal activities, safeguard the virtual realm's integrity, and uphold justice in the digital age. \nCybercrimes, Technological Advancements. \n Page: 1873 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research\nINTRODUCTION\nVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe rapid expansion of Information Technology (IT) has significantly permeated all aspects of our lives, both personally and professionally. However, this relentless pursuit of technological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant drive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering the landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, technology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals such as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, mobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a collective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader concept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities intricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these technologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the conventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, either as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in electronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the reliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when associated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within legal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of law, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber forensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the judicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital evidence in legal proceedings. \n Page: 1874 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nNavigating E-Evidence: Care and Caution \nUnderstanding the intrinsic nature of electronic evidence holds tremendous significance, as it differs significantly from other forms of evidence. Manipulating electronic evidence is relatively easier, especially for experts regularly dealing with it. Hence, managing these intricate pieces of evidence requires exceptional care and caution. \nViruses, Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs), and physical damage stand as primary threats to electronic evidence. Adopting tried-and-tested tools and methodologies, confirmed by experts, becomes crucial to navigate the intricacies of complex evidence accurately. To mitigate errors during evidence collection, it's essential to subject the tools to simulated examinations each time they're utilized. \nPreserving the integrity of data is paramount, and therefore, experts and novices alike should refrain from manipulating sensitive information whenever possible. Adhering strictly to these fundamental practices can bring about a significant transformation in ensuring the successful conclusion of legal proceedings. \nUnderstanding the Legal Landscape: Federal Law on Evidence \nTo ensure the admissibility of 'electronic evidence,' adherence to the 'best evidence rule' and 'chain of custody' is essential to mitigate any suspicion of tampering. The ideal evidence is considered to be in its original form, with printouts or outputs accepted as originals if they accurately reflect the information stored in a computer or similar device. \nA framework for admitting electronically admissible evidence is outlined in the Lorraine model. It emphasizes several key considerations: \n1.Relevance: The evidence must have the potential to make a fact relevant to the case \tmore or less probable than it would be without such evidence. \n2.Authenticity: It's crucial to establish beyond doubt that the electronic evidence presented is indeed what it claims to be, as electronic data can be easily altered. Thorough authentication is necessary to ensure its credibility. \n3.Hearsay: The issue of hearsay needs to be addressed, specifically whether the \n Page: 1875 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nelectronic data constitutes an assertion by the declarant and whether any exceptions to the hearsay rule apply. \n4.Original Document Rule: This principle refers to the admissibility of the original form of the document or evidence, emphasizing the importance of preserving the integrity of electronic evidence. \n5.Balancing Test: Lastly, the potential risks of prejudice, confusion, or undue delay \tversus the probative value of the electronic evidence should be weighed. \nFor proponents to successfully use electronic evidence, these fundamental principles must be meticulously followed. \n\u2022\tLogical Relevance: According to Federal rules of evidence, relevant proof is \tadmissible while irrelevant proof is not. The court's determination of logical relevance \tis reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. This logical relevance test is applied \tto electronic evidence in a manner similar to traditional evidence, ensuring fairness and \tconsistency. \n\u2022\tAuthentication: Ensuring the authenticity of electronic evidence is crucial. Given the \tsusceptibility of electronic data to manipulation, rigorous measures must be taken to \tmaintain its admissibility. Courts must ascertain, beyond any doubt, the integrity and \toriginality of electronic evidence to prevent any miscarriage of justice. \nIn summary, maintaining the authenticity, relevance, and integrity of electronic evidence is imperative to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings. Courts must rigorously scrutinize electronic evidence to maintain the fairness and accuracy of the judicial process. \nExamining the Legal Landscape: Evidence Laws in India \nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 was enacted to address the emerging need for regulations in cyberspace. It introduced concepts like 'digital signatures,' 'encryption,' and 'electronic evidence,' which were previously unfamiliar in the law of evidence. Initially, there were no provisions to introduce them as evidence in courts. \nConsequently, amendments were made to the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 to align it \n Page: 1876 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nwith the changing times and make it more adaptable. Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence submitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers to data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic form or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, audio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information Technology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the definition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly include a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents encompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or phone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of the Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone and this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of evidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice recording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The admissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, and ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or erasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is considered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the admissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1877 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court has established specific conditions for the admissibility of voice \nrecordings in conversations: \n1.Identification of Speaker's Voice: The person who made the recording or others who \nrecognize the speaker's voice should identify it. In cases where the maker can't identify \nthe voice, stringent proof is necessary to establish it as the alleged speaker's voice. \n2.Verification of Accuracy: The maker of the recording must prove the accuracy of the \nrecorded statement through high-quality evidence, either direct or circumstantial. \n3.Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4.Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5.Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6.Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved. However, Section 65 of the \nIEA6 allows for secondary proof of the contents of a document, including electronic records, \nin certain circumstances as specified. \n5 Sec 64, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n6 Sec 65, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1878 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nSections 64 and 65 of the IEA7 emphasize the fundamental rule of evidence, stating that the best evidence available in the circumstances should be presented to prove a fact in question. These sections provide guidance on how documents, including electronic records, should be proven and admitted as evidence in legal proceedings. \nIt has been established by the Supreme Court in the case of State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu (also known as the Parliament attack case) that call records from mobile phones are admissible as evidence under section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA). There is no specific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also ruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of calls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls can be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in the Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. Initially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on the mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B (4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent witness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including how the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability and authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an expert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot Sandhu10 mentioned earlier. However, in the case of R.K. Anand v. Delhi High Court11, the Supreme Court was deliberating on the admissibility of recordings stored on microchips and CDs. \n7 Ibid \n8 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n9 Ibid \n10 Appeal (crl.)  373-375 of 2004 \n11 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1393 OF 2008 \n Page: 1879 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn this case, the court observed that the authenticity and integrity of the recording operation were never in doubt or disputed. Specifically, it dealt with a situation where a microchip was preserved by a well-known television channel studio, leading the court to believe that the recording could not have been tampered with. \nThe procedure for admitting a CD as evidence was considered in the Re-Ramlila Maidan Incident Dt ... vs Home Secretary And Ors12. Here, the court directed the submission of a CD containing a recording, accompanied by an affidavit as required under Section 65B of the IEA. The court accepted an affidavit from the trustee confirming that the CD had not been tampered with, and subsequently, the CD was taken on record. \nIn numerous cases, courts have refused to attribute probative value to digital data if it does not comply with Section 65B of the IEA. This section outlines specific conditions that need to be fulfilled for the admissibility of electronic evidence, especially recordings, in court. These conditions include certification and verification regarding the integrity of the electronic record, ensuring its authenticity and correctness. If digital data doesn't adhere to these provisions, courts might deny its admissibility or probative value in legal proceedings. \nJudiciary trend on E-Evidence admissibility\nIn the recent landmark case of Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer13 (referred to as the \"Anvar Case\"), the Supreme Court took the opportunity to clarify the law concerning the admissibility of digital evidence in judicial proceedings. The case revolved around the assembly elections in Kerala in 2011, where the appellant contested the election results, alleging corrupt practices under Section 100(1)(b) read with Sections 123(2)(ii) and (4) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951. Having lost the appeal in the high court, the appellants appealed to the apex court. \nThe evidence presented in the case consisted of three elements: digital data, documentary evidence other than digital data, and oral evidence. As the main focus of arguments was on electronic evidence, the court addressed this aspect first. \n12 SUO MOTU WRIT PETITION (CRL.) NO. 122 OF 2011 13 AIR 2015 SC 180 \n Page: 1880 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court recognized the relevance of various sections of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA), including sections 3, 22A, 45A, 59, 65A, and notably, Section 65B concerning the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in the form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court highlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced by a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite anything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record produced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-section (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as computer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These conditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal proceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \n\tUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for admitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the computer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing data for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. (ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should have been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) Throughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any disruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The data in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into the computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't allow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B of the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament attack case. \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1881 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn a subsequent case, SanjaySinh Ramrao Chavan v. Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where evidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, the Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was not suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the conversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch witnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to analysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without a credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar case, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements for admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as defined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a feasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory chip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the laboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being compared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then the transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or admissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link between the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it as evidence in legal proceedings. Without such a link and without verification methods such as comparing hash values, the authenticity and reliability of the digital evidence, such as the content on the CD, may come into question and might not be accepted as credible evidence in court16. \n15 CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4288  OF 2017 \n16 S.

However, this relentless pursuit of technological advancements has also given rise to various societal challenges. The constant drive for progress has led to the emergence of new dimensions in criminal activities, altering the landscape of crime. \nWhen we contemplate the term 'Computer', it conjures images of the internet, technology, and virtual worlds. This encompasses a wide array of elements for professionals such as lawyers or technicians, including computers, networks, data storage devices, software, mobile phones, and ATMs. All these components fall within the realm of 'cyberspace'\u2014a collective term encompassing anything related to technology or connected to the broader concept of 'computers' and their derivatives. \nThe utilization of sophisticated technologies by criminals has made their activities intricate and challenging to apprehend. Understanding and tracing the origins of these technologically-driven crimes demand a level of proficiency in this field that exceeds the conventional understanding. \nIn recent years, the term 'cybercrime' has emerged, denoting crimes where a computer, either as a tool or a target, plays a central role. Evidence presented in such cases is often in electronic format. However, without the testimony of an expert witness, doubts about the reliability of this evidence can arise. \nThis is where the pivotal role of cyber forensics becomes evident. Forensics, when associated with cyberspace, refers to employing scientific and technological methods within legal proceedings to establish factual evidence. In essence, cyber forensics deals with the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of computer-related evidence in a court of law, often termed as \"electronic evidence.\" \nBy integrating scientific methodologies with the technological landscape, cyber forensics bridges the gap between criminal activities conducted through technology and the judicial system. Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital evidence in legal proceedings. \n Page: 1874 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nNavigating E-Evidence: Care and Caution \nUnderstanding the intrinsic nature of electronic evidence holds tremendous significance, as it differs significantly from other forms of evidence. Manipulating electronic evidence is relatively easier, especially for experts regularly dealing with it. Hence, managing these intricate pieces of evidence requires exceptional care and caution. \nViruses, Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs), and physical damage stand as primary threats to electronic evidence. Adopting tried-and-tested tools and methodologies, confirmed by experts, becomes crucial to navigate the intricacies of complex evidence accurately. To mitigate errors during evidence collection, it's essential to subject the tools to simulated examinations each time they're utilized. \nPreserving the integrity of data is paramount, and therefore, experts and novices alike should refrain from manipulating sensitive information whenever possible. Adhering strictly to these fundamental practices can bring about a significant transformation in ensuring the successful conclusion of legal proceedings. \nUnderstanding the Legal Landscape: Federal Law on Evidence \nTo ensure the admissibility of 'electronic evidence,' adherence to the 'best evidence rule' and 'chain of custody' is essential to mitigate any suspicion of tampering. The ideal evidence is considered to be in its original form, with printouts or outputs accepted as originals if they accurately reflect the information stored in a computer or similar device. \nA framework for admitting electronically admissible evidence is outlined in the Lorraine model. It emphasizes several key considerations: \n1.Relevance: The evidence must have the potential to make a fact relevant to the case \tmore or less probable than it would be without such evidence. \n2.Authenticity: It's crucial to establish beyond doubt that the electronic evidence presented is indeed what it claims to be, as electronic data can be easily altered. Thorough authentication is necessary to ensure its credibility. \n3.Hearsay: The issue of hearsay needs to be addressed, specifically whether the \n Page: 1875 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nelectronic data constitutes an assertion by the declarant and whether any exceptions to the hearsay rule apply. \n4.Original Document Rule: This principle refers to the admissibility of the original form of the document or evidence, emphasizing the importance of preserving the integrity of electronic evidence. \n5.Balancing Test: Lastly, the potential risks of prejudice, confusion, or undue delay \tversus the probative value of the electronic evidence should be weighed. \nFor proponents to successfully use electronic evidence, these fundamental principles must be meticulously followed. \n\u2022\tLogical Relevance: According to Federal rules of evidence, relevant proof is \tadmissible while irrelevant proof is not. The court's determination of logical relevance \tis reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. This logical relevance test is applied \tto electronic evidence in a manner similar to traditional evidence, ensuring fairness and \tconsistency. \n\u2022\tAuthentication: Ensuring the authenticity of electronic evidence is crucial. Given the \tsusceptibility of electronic data to manipulation, rigorous measures must be taken to \tmaintain its admissibility. Courts must ascertain, beyond any doubt, the integrity and \toriginality of electronic evidence to prevent any miscarriage of justice. \nIn summary, maintaining the authenticity, relevance, and integrity of electronic evidence is imperative to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings. Courts must rigorously scrutinize electronic evidence to maintain the fairness and accuracy of the judicial process. \nExamining the Legal Landscape: Evidence Laws in India \nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 was enacted to address the emerging need for regulations in cyberspace. It introduced concepts like 'digital signatures,' 'encryption,' and 'electronic evidence,' which were previously unfamiliar in the law of evidence. Initially, there were no provisions to introduce them as evidence in courts. \nConsequently, amendments were made to the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 to align it \n Page: 1876 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nwith the changing times and make it more adaptable. Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence submitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers to data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic form or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, audio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information Technology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the definition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly include a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents encompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or phone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of the Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone and this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of evidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice recording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The admissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, and ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or erasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is considered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the admissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1877 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court has established specific conditions for the admissibility of voice \nrecordings in conversations: \n1.Identification of Speaker's Voice: The person who made the recording or others who \nrecognize the speaker's voice should identify it. In cases where the maker can't identify \nthe voice, stringent proof is necessary to establish it as the alleged speaker's voice. \n2.Verification of Accuracy: The maker of the recording must prove the accuracy of the \nrecorded statement through high-quality evidence, either direct or circumstantial. \n3.Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4.Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5.Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6.Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved. However, Section 65 of the \nIEA6 allows for secondary proof of the contents of a document, including electronic records, \nin certain circumstances as specified. \n5 Sec 64, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n6 Sec 65, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1878 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nSections 64 and 65 of the IEA7 emphasize the fundamental rule of evidence, stating that the best evidence available in the circumstances should be presented to prove a fact in question. These sections provide guidance on how documents, including electronic records, should be proven and admitted as evidence in legal proceedings. \nIt has been established by the Supreme Court in the case of State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu (also known as the Parliament attack case) that call records from mobile phones are admissible as evidence under section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA). There is no specific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also ruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of calls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls can be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in the Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. Initially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on the mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B (4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent witness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including how the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability and authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an expert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot Sandhu10 mentioned earlier. However, in the case of R.K. Anand v. Delhi High Court11, the Supreme Court was deliberating on the admissibility of recordings stored on microchips and CDs. \n7 Ibid \n8 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n9 Ibid \n10 Appeal (crl.)  373-375 of 2004 \n11 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1393 OF 2008 \n Page: 1879 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn this case, the court observed that the authenticity and integrity of the recording operation were never in doubt or disputed. Specifically, it dealt with a situation where a microchip was preserved by a well-known television channel studio, leading the court to believe that the recording could not have been tampered with. \nThe procedure for admitting a CD as evidence was considered in the Re-Ramlila Maidan Incident Dt ... vs Home Secretary And Ors12. Here, the court directed the submission of a CD containing a recording, accompanied by an affidavit as required under Section 65B of the IEA. The court accepted an affidavit from the trustee confirming that the CD had not been tampered with, and subsequently, the CD was taken on record. \nIn numerous cases, courts have refused to attribute probative value to digital data if it does not comply with Section 65B of the IEA. This section outlines specific conditions that need to be fulfilled for the admissibility of electronic evidence, especially recordings, in court. These conditions include certification and verification regarding the integrity of the electronic record, ensuring its authenticity and correctness. If digital data doesn't adhere to these provisions, courts might deny its admissibility or probative value in legal proceedings. \nJudiciary trend on E-Evidence admissibility\nIn the recent landmark case of Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer13 (referred to as the \"Anvar Case\"), the Supreme Court took the opportunity to clarify the law concerning the admissibility of digital evidence in judicial proceedings. The case revolved around the assembly elections in Kerala in 2011, where the appellant contested the election results, alleging corrupt practices under Section 100(1)(b) read with Sections 123(2)(ii) and (4) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951. Having lost the appeal in the high court, the appellants appealed to the apex court. \nThe evidence presented in the case consisted of three elements: digital data, documentary evidence other than digital data, and oral evidence. As the main focus of arguments was on electronic evidence, the court addressed this aspect first. \n12 SUO MOTU WRIT PETITION (CRL.) NO. 122 OF 2011 13 AIR 2015 SC 180 \n Page: 1880 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court recognized the relevance of various sections of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA), including sections 3, 22A, 45A, 59, 65A, and notably, Section 65B concerning the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in the form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court highlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced by a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite anything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record produced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-section (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as computer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These conditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal proceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \n\tUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for admitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the computer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing data for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. (ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should have been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) Throughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any disruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The data in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into the computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't allow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B of the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament attack case. \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1881 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn a subsequent case, SanjaySinh Ramrao Chavan v. Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where evidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, the Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was not suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the conversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch witnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to analysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without a credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar case, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements for admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as defined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a feasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory chip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the laboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being compared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then the transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or admissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link between the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it as evidence in legal proceedings. Without such a link and without verification methods such as comparing hash values, the authenticity and reliability of the digital evidence, such as the content on the CD, may come into question and might not be accepted as credible evidence in court16. \n15 CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4288  OF 2017 \n16 S.

Its application is vital in ensuring the authenticity and admissibility of digital evidence in legal proceedings. \n Page: 1874 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nNavigating E-Evidence: Care and Caution \nUnderstanding the intrinsic nature of electronic evidence holds tremendous significance, as it differs significantly from other forms of evidence. Manipulating electronic evidence is relatively easier, especially for experts regularly dealing with it. Hence, managing these intricate pieces of evidence requires exceptional care and caution. \nViruses, Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs), and physical damage stand as primary threats to electronic evidence. Adopting tried-and-tested tools and methodologies, confirmed by experts, becomes crucial to navigate the intricacies of complex evidence accurately. To mitigate errors during evidence collection, it's essential to subject the tools to simulated examinations each time they're utilized. \nPreserving the integrity of data is paramount, and therefore, experts and novices alike should refrain from manipulating sensitive information whenever possible. Adhering strictly to these fundamental practices can bring about a significant transformation in ensuring the successful conclusion of legal proceedings. \nUnderstanding the Legal Landscape: Federal Law on Evidence \nTo ensure the admissibility of 'electronic evidence,' adherence to the 'best evidence rule' and 'chain of custody' is essential to mitigate any suspicion of tampering. The ideal evidence is considered to be in its original form, with printouts or outputs accepted as originals if they accurately reflect the information stored in a computer or similar device. \nA framework for admitting electronically admissible evidence is outlined in the Lorraine model. It emphasizes several key considerations: \n1.Relevance: The evidence must have the potential to make a fact relevant to the case \tmore or less probable than it would be without such evidence. \n2.Authenticity: It's crucial to establish beyond doubt that the electronic evidence presented is indeed what it claims to be, as electronic data can be easily altered. Thorough authentication is necessary to ensure its credibility. \n3.Hearsay: The issue of hearsay needs to be addressed, specifically whether the \n Page: 1875 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nelectronic data constitutes an assertion by the declarant and whether any exceptions to the hearsay rule apply. \n4.Original Document Rule: This principle refers to the admissibility of the original form of the document or evidence, emphasizing the importance of preserving the integrity of electronic evidence. \n5.Balancing Test: Lastly, the potential risks of prejudice, confusion, or undue delay \tversus the probative value of the electronic evidence should be weighed. \nFor proponents to successfully use electronic evidence, these fundamental principles must be meticulously followed. \n\u2022\tLogical Relevance: According to Federal rules of evidence, relevant proof is \tadmissible while irrelevant proof is not. The court's determination of logical relevance \tis reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. This logical relevance test is applied \tto electronic evidence in a manner similar to traditional evidence, ensuring fairness and \tconsistency. \n\u2022\tAuthentication: Ensuring the authenticity of electronic evidence is crucial. Given the \tsusceptibility of electronic data to manipulation, rigorous measures must be taken to \tmaintain its admissibility. Courts must ascertain, beyond any doubt, the integrity and \toriginality of electronic evidence to prevent any miscarriage of justice. \nIn summary, maintaining the authenticity, relevance, and integrity of electronic evidence is imperative to ensure its admissibility in legal proceedings. Courts must rigorously scrutinize electronic evidence to maintain the fairness and accuracy of the judicial process. \nExamining the Legal Landscape: Evidence Laws in India \nThe Information Technology Act of 2000 was enacted to address the emerging need for regulations in cyberspace. It introduced concepts like 'digital signatures,' 'encryption,' and 'electronic evidence,' which were previously unfamiliar in the law of evidence. Initially, there were no provisions to introduce them as evidence in courts. \nConsequently, amendments were made to the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 to align it \n Page: 1876 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nwith the changing times and make it more adaptable. Both the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 provide legal recognition to digital records and evidence submitted in the form of electronic data. \nAs per Section 2(t) of the Information Technology Act, 20001, \"electronic record\" refers to data, record, or information generated, image or sound stored, received, or sent in electronic form or through microfilm or computer-generated microfiche. The Information Technology Amendment Act, 2008, defines a \"communication device\" under Section 2(ha)2 as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, or a combination thereof used for transmitting text, video, audio, or images. \nOne significant change introduced in the evidence law through the Information Technology Act was the acknowledgment of digital documents as evidence. Although the definition of the term \"document\" under section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act does not explicitly include a digital record, it's evident from the amended definition of \"evidence\" that documents encompass digital records. \nTherefore, any information in electronic form\u2014be it text, images, internet records, or phone logs\u2014is considered an electronic record and qualifies as \"evidence\" for the purposes of the Indian Evidence Act. For instance, if individual A threatens individual B over the phone and this conversation is recorded by B on his mobile phone, this recording becomes a piece of evidence. In this scenario, the court can inspect B's mobile phone containing the voice recording or a transcript of the recorded communication as evidence. \nRegarding technological advancements, the Supreme Court, in R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra3, deemed tape-recorded communication admissible as evidence. The admissibility criteria include relevance to the matter in question, identification of the voices, and ensuring the accuracy of the communication by safeguarding against any tampering or erasure of the recording. A contemporary tape recording of a relevant conversation is considered admissible evidence under Section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act4, similar to the admissibility of a photograph depicting a relevant incident. \n1 Sec 2(t) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n2 Sec 2(ha) ,Information Technology Act, 2000 \n3 1973 AIR 157 \n4 Sec 7, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1877 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court has established specific conditions for the admissibility of voice \nrecordings in conversations: \n1.Identification of Speaker's Voice: The person who made the recording or others who \nrecognize the speaker's voice should identify it. In cases where the maker can't identify \nthe voice, stringent proof is necessary to establish it as the alleged speaker's voice. \n2.Verification of Accuracy: The maker of the recording must prove the accuracy of the \nrecorded statement through high-quality evidence, either direct or circumstantial. \n3.Prevention of Tampering or Erasure: Any possibility of tampering or erasure of the \nrecorded statement must be completely excluded to ensure its integrity. \n4.Relevance: The recorded statement must be relevant to the matter under consideration. \n5.Secure Custody of Recording: The recorded cassette, compact disk, mobile phone, \ndata card, etc., should be sealed and kept in safe and reliable custody. \n6.Clarity and Audibility: The voice of the specific speaker should be clear and not \ndistorted or overshadowed by other sounds or disturbances. \nHowever, it's crucial to note that these conditions for admissibility of tape-recorded \nconversations were established before the Information Technology Act (ITA). It's essential to \ninterpret these conditions in the context of the time they were laid down and to consider how \nthe landscape might have evolved post the ITA. \nFurthermore, when it comes to electronic records, it's important to understand that their \ncontents cannot be proven through oral evidence. Instead, they can be proved using either \nprimary or secondary evidence. According to Section 64 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA)5, \ndocuments, including electronic records, must primarily be proved. However, Section 65 of the \nIEA6 allows for secondary proof of the contents of a document, including electronic records, \nin certain circumstances as specified. \n5 Sec 64, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n6 Sec 65, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1878 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nSections 64 and 65 of the IEA7 emphasize the fundamental rule of evidence, stating that the best evidence available in the circumstances should be presented to prove a fact in question. These sections provide guidance on how documents, including electronic records, should be proven and admitted as evidence in legal proceedings. \nIt has been established by the Supreme Court in the case of State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu (also known as the Parliament attack case) that call records from mobile phones are admissible as evidence under section 7 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA). There is no specific prohibition against admitting call records of telephones or mobiles. The court also ruled that it's not always necessary to present examining experts to prove the authenticity of calls made through phones or mobiles. \nIn this case, the Supreme Court further affirmed that secondary evidence of such calls can be presented under Sections 63 & 65 of the IEA. The entire conspiracy theory presented in the Parliament attack case was based on intercepted call records of the accused individuals. Initially, an argument was made on behalf of the accused that the prosecution couldn't rely on the mobile phone call records due to the absence of the relevant certificate under section 65B (4) of the IEA8. \nHowever, the Supreme Court concluded that a cross-examination of a competent witness familiar with the functioning of the computer during the relevant time period, including how the printouts of the call records were obtained, was sufficient to establish the reliability and authenticity of the call records as evidence. The court emphasized that the testimony of an expert witness wasn't mandatory to establish the admissibility of call records in such cases. \nCertainly, the Supreme Court did not address Sections 65A and 65B9 of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) concerning the admissibility of digital data in the N.C.T of Delhi v/s Navjot Sandhu10 mentioned earlier. However, in the case of R.K. Anand v. Delhi High Court11, the Supreme Court was deliberating on the admissibility of recordings stored on microchips and CDs. \n7 Ibid \n8 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n9 Ibid \n10 Appeal (crl.)  373-375 of 2004 \n11 CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1393 OF 2008 \n Page: 1879 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn this case, the court observed that the authenticity and integrity of the recording operation were never in doubt or disputed. Specifically, it dealt with a situation where a microchip was preserved by a well-known television channel studio, leading the court to believe that the recording could not have been tampered with. \nThe procedure for admitting a CD as evidence was considered in the Re-Ramlila Maidan Incident Dt ... vs Home Secretary And Ors12. Here, the court directed the submission of a CD containing a recording, accompanied by an affidavit as required under Section 65B of the IEA. The court accepted an affidavit from the trustee confirming that the CD had not been tampered with, and subsequently, the CD was taken on record. \nIn numerous cases, courts have refused to attribute probative value to digital data if it does not comply with Section 65B of the IEA. This section outlines specific conditions that need to be fulfilled for the admissibility of electronic evidence, especially recordings, in court. These conditions include certification and verification regarding the integrity of the electronic record, ensuring its authenticity and correctness. If digital data doesn't adhere to these provisions, courts might deny its admissibility or probative value in legal proceedings. \nJudiciary trend on E-Evidence admissibility\nIn the recent landmark case of Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer13 (referred to as the \"Anvar Case\"), the Supreme Court took the opportunity to clarify the law concerning the admissibility of digital evidence in judicial proceedings. The case revolved around the assembly elections in Kerala in 2011, where the appellant contested the election results, alleging corrupt practices under Section 100(1)(b) read with Sections 123(2)(ii) and (4) of The Representation of the People Act, 1951. Having lost the appeal in the high court, the appellants appealed to the apex court. \nThe evidence presented in the case consisted of three elements: digital data, documentary evidence other than digital data, and oral evidence. As the main focus of arguments was on electronic evidence, the court addressed this aspect first. \n12 SUO MOTU WRIT PETITION (CRL.) NO. 122 OF 2011 13 AIR 2015 SC 180 \n Page: 1880 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nThe Supreme Court recognized the relevance of various sections of the Indian Evidence Act (IEA), including sections 3, 22A, 45A, 59, 65A, and notably, Section 65B concerning the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court emphasized that any documentary evidence in the form of an electronic record, as per sections 59 and 65A of the IEA, can only be proved in accordance with the procedure prescribed under Section 65B. \nSection 65B14 specifically deals with the admissibility of electronic evidence. The court highlighted that its purpose is to authenticate secondary evidence in electronic form produced by a computer. Notably, the section begins with a non obstante clause, meaning that despite anything contrary in the Evidence Act, any information contained in an electronic record produced by a computer shall be considered a document only if the conditions under Sub-section (2) of Section 65B are satisfied. The admissibility of such electronic records, known as computer output, hinges on meeting the four conditions specified under Section 65B(2). These conditions play a crucial role in determining the admissibility of electronic records in legal proceedings without the need for further evidence or production of the original. \n\tUnder Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act, the following conditions are necessary for admitting a digital record as evidence: \n(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been generated by the computer used during a period over which it was regularly employed for storing or processing data for an activity routinely conducted by the person having lawful control over the computer. (ii) The data of the type included in the electronic record or from which it is derived should have been consistently inputted into the computer during the regular course of that activity. (iii) Throughout the relevant period, the computer should have been operating properly, and any disruptions or damage should not have affected the accuracy or integrity of the record. (iv) The data in the electronic record should be a reproduction or derived from the information fed into the computer during the usual course of the activity. \nThe Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the Indian Evidence Act (IEA) doesn't allow the proof of a digital record through oral evidence if the requirements under Section 65B of the IEA are not met. This stance effectively overrules the approach taken in the Parliament attack case. \n14 Sec 65B, The Indian Evidence Act,1872 \n Page: 1881 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nIn a subsequent case, SanjaySinh Ramrao Chavan v. Dattatray Gulabrao Phalke, where evidence of demanding a bribe was sought to be proved using a tape-recorded conversation, the Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible. The Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, State of Maharashtra, reported that the conversation was inaudible and thus was not suitable for spectrographic analysis. The counsel for the respondents argued that the conversation was translated and authenticated by the panch witnesses. However, these panch witnesses had not actually heard the conversation as they were not present in the room. \nThe Supreme Court emphasized that since the voice recording itself wasn't subjected to analysis and the translated version lacked authenticity, relying on the translated version without a credible source for its authenticity was unwarranted. Reiterating the decision in the Anvar case, the Supreme Court stressed the significance of source and authenticity as critical elements for admitting digital evidence. \nIn the case of Ram Kishan Fauji v. State of Haryana15, the Punjab and Haryana High Court dealt with electronic evidence in the form of a CD, considered an electronic record as defined under the Information Technology Act (ITA). The court highlighted the absence of a feasible link between the digital evidence storage media, specifically the CD, and the memory chip presumed to be the source for replicating the data on the CD, as mentioned in the laboratory report. \nThe court emphasized that if the CD could not substantiate its authenticity by being compared with its hash value or any source from which it purportedly derived the data, then the transcript of the audio or video content on the CD could not be considered valuable or admissible as evidence. \nThis ruling underscores the importance of establishing a reliable and authentic link between the storage media and the source of the electronic data, especially when presenting it as evidence in legal proceedings. Without such a link and without verification methods such as comparing hash values, the authenticity and reliability of the digital evidence, such as the content on the CD, may come into question and might not be accepted as credible evidence in court16. \n15 CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4288  OF 2017 \n16 S.

The interconnected nature of the internet presents dilemmas for law enforcement and legal systems, as determining the jurisdiction responsible for investigating and prosecuting cybercrimes becomes convoluted. The absence of geographical boundaries allows cybercriminals to perpetrate attacks from one country, target victims in another, and store data in yet another jurisdiction. This presents a significant challenge in pinpointing where the crime occurred and which legal framework \n21 Prof. R.K.Chaubey, \u201cAn Introduction to Cyber Crime and Cyber law\u201d, Kamal Law House, 2012 22 Amit Kumar Das, Types of Jurisdictions, WRITINGLAW.COM, Aug 8,2023  10 Types or Kinds of Jurisdiction of Indian Courts (writinglaw.com) \n Page: 1889 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research\nshould apply23. \nVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nWhen multiple countries are involved in an incident, jurisdictional challenges escalate. For example, a cyber-attack might originate from Country A, affect victims' data in Country B, and have its infrastructure located in Country C. Determining which country's laws apply and which authorities should lead the investigation becomes a complex issue. Discrepancies in legal standards across jurisdictions further complicate cybercrime investigations. What might be deemed cybercrime in one country could be considered a legitimate activity in another. Additionally, varying levels of technological expertise within law enforcement agencies impact their effectiveness in probing cybercrimes, leading to differences in investigation quality and thoroughness. \nPreserving and admitting digital evidence in court poses another hurdle. Digital evidence is volatile and easily tampered with, especially when stored in different jurisdictions. Obtaining evidence in a timely and lawful manner becomes challenging. Diverse standards for admitting digital evidence in court create doubts about its authenticity and reliability. Maintaining the chain of custody for digital evidence across borders is crucial but problematic. \nInternational cooperation, often facilitated by Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs), aims to assist investigations and evidence collection. However, bureaucratic delays in these processes hinder timely information exchange, allowing cybercriminals to evade justice. Political or diplomatic issues may also deter some countries from cooperating, providing safe havens for cybercriminals24. \nAnonymizing technologies like Tor and VPNs further complicate matters by masking the origin of cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals leverage these technologies to obfuscate their location, making it challenging to trace them accurately. Efforts to standardize cybercrime legislation and cooperation frameworks, like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, aim to address these issues, yet gaps persist due to uneven adoption. \n23 Amit Kumar Das, Types of Jurisdictions, WRITINGLAW.COM, Aug 8,2023  10 Types or Kinds of Jurisdiction of Indian Courts (writinglaw.com) \n24 Jennifer Bussell, Cyberspace, BRITANNICA, Aug 8, 2023, Cyberspace | Digital Communications & Security | Britannica \n Page: 1890 \nIndian Journal of Law and Legal Research \tVolume VI Issue I | ISSN: 2582-8878\nAddressing jurisdictional challenges requires international collaboration among law enforcement, governments, and tech companies. Enhanced communication channels and rapid information sharing mechanisms are crucial for swift responses to cyber threats. Developing standardized procedures for evidence collection and preservation across borders and boosting cybersecurity awareness within law enforcement are essential steps towards effectively combating cybercrime in the digital era.\nCONCLUSION \nThe synergy between E-Evidence and Cyber Forensics has profoundly transformed how the legal system manages digital information. Their interdependent relationship plays a pivotal role in identifying and scrutinizing electronic evidence, now an indispensable component of legal procedures. Adapting to the dynamic digital landscape necessitates collaboration among legal practitioners, law enforcement, and forensic experts. It's crucial to modify methodologies in tandem with technological progress while upholding fundamental principles such as transparency, integrity, and safeguarding individual rights. \nIndia's accomplishment in keeping pace with technological advancements through significant legislative amendments in response to these changes is commendable for law enforcement agencies and lawmakers. However, ensuring adequate training for Implementing Authorities to effectively execute these provisions is a critical and immediate need. It's anticipated that in the forthcoming years, this issue will be addressed, leading to a revamped, modernized, and technologically adept framework of laws and enforcement practices. \n Page: 1891 "}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

To create and preserve the Internet as a \npublic good, concerted global action is needed on the \nbasis of a common norm, which makes states mutu-\nally responsible for their diligence in national regula-\ntory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in \nthe German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as \nthe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides \nfor civil, police and military-defensive approaches to \nprotecting information-technology (IT) systems and \ninfrastructure. \nIn the course of the discussion about a new German \ncybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn \nof this year, a growing number of political voices have \nalso argued that political regulation and digital sover-\neignty should be strengthened and renationalised. Poli-\ntics must face up to the reality of the military becom-\ning increasingly operative in cyberspace. This will be \nreflected in the German Federal Government\u2019s new \nWhite Paper as well as in NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s future \ncyberdefence. In other words, it will be implemented \nin the German and European security policy as well as \nin their defence missions and military procurement. \nLiberal democracies need to be aware that the idea \nof a free and open Internet can only be realized if \nthere is consensus among a \u201ccoalition of liberal states\u201d \nnot only on how the Internet should be governend but \nwhy International and transatlantic cooperation is \nmeaningful. German and European policy should go \nahead and orientate itself on the norm of due dili-\ngence in cyberspace \u2013 and do so in an interministerial \nway \u2013 so as to enforce it internationally. Due diligence \nin cyberspace builds on the international legal stand-\nard of due diligence, which stipulates that a state \nmust do everything necessary to prevent actions ema-\nnating from within its own territory that might in-\nfringe the rights of third parties. In the Organisation \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), \nfor instance, there is far-reaching consensus on due \ndiligence, which would be an obvious choice for the \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n5\nIssues and Recommendations \nnormative basis for a global cyber order. The political rules adopted for an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy will always lag behind techno-logical developments. It is the more important, there-\nthe decision taken in December 2015 to continue the Internet Governance Forum \u2013 in other words, to keep pursuing the multi-stakeholder approach \u2013 still offers the best chance of preventing the idea of a global free \n\uf034European cooperation: integrating national policies into the European framework; \n\uf034Inclusiveness: giving different interest groups broad and publicly accessible representation in formulat-\nstakeholder approach (interpreted inclusively) and to reject the principle of intergovernmental decision-making. The experience of the WSIS process of the past ten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of inter-\ning policies; \tgovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would \n\uf034Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-ponent over the military component, particularly \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-ing on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \nin times of peace. operators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states behave responsibly not only towards one another, but also in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. The EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided for this. As part of implementing the EU directive on network and information security (NIS), all EU states must introduce minimum standards and reporting requirements for IT security, and operators of critical infrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national regulations in civil law (data protection), commercial law (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-mestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-fil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, it will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned Global Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members largely agree that states are responsible for their own behaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation among Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as well as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE negotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-crime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The minimum conditions for global cybersecurity are ratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as well as continuous confidence- and security-building measures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, which was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) follow-up process, showed that a worldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-erly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-gy to protect the economy and industry against espio-nage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-bilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense indicates that it wants to build additional defensive capabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not be advisable for the government to evolve towards an offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in open contradiction with the idea of due diligence in cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the risk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber attacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-cult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause serious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on the German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is to persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring a given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse to NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against Islamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last resorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to prop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-rity technology, for developing digital forensics, and for extensive further-training measures to heighten awareness among civil servants, scientists, academics and researchers. Confidence-building measures within the OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under the leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-sified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving bilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-ing and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and remove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of this is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term.

Albania, The Corfu Channel Case (Merits), Judgment of April 9th, 1949, 4\u201338. \n8  For the application of this concept to cybersecurity, see Scott Shackelford, Scott Russell and Andreas Kuehn, Unpacking the International Law on Cybersecurity Due Diligence: Lessons From the Public and Private Sectors, Kelley School of Business Research Paper no. 15\u201364 (Bloomington: Indiana University, 27 August 2015). 9  Michael N.

According to the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-tories, and especially the computersystems and infra-structure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 control, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-ture of other states.13 \n\tDue diligence is usually translated in international law treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-pflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions on one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful to use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The principle of due diligence derives its particular norma-tive force from the idea that states are not only respon-sible for keeping law and order on their own territories, but also bear responsibility for the external consequences of \n10  International Court of Justice, \u201cCase Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Decisions taken by individual states increasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-ritory. That is why states must exercise care with such decisions and be accountable to one another for them. As far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply limit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. This study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-net needs to the political will by all stakeholders for international cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in cooperation with other states are obliged to do every-thing that may be reasonably expected of them to help deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \n\t\tThis expectation encompasses decision-making processes that meet high standards. This means that available competences should be integrated as far as possible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics should be avoided.16 In other words, an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due diligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode of regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated at the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated into inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17\uf034Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \t\twith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\t\tness as well as transparency. As Christopher Daase \t\tpointed out: \u201cIn democracies, in the long term, no \t\tpolicy can be pushed through against the will of \t\tthe majority and not even against the resistance of \n15  The collaboration of IT emergency teams (Computer Emer-gency Response Team, CERT) in the CyberGreen project (www. \ncybergreen.net) could serve as a model. Here, CERTs from the Pacific Region states as well as Japan and China work together to ensure a \u201cgreen cyberspace\u201d.They perceive themselves as strictly technical, but the project is nevertheless based on the idea of jointly identifying and rectifying weak areas, such as malware or vulnerable networks. \n16  An example is the debate about communications encryption and the divergent positions of the security agencies on the one hand and industry representatives on the other hand. On this point, see also Berklett Cybersecurity Project, ed., Don\u2019t Panic: Making Progress on the \u201cGoing Dark\u201d Debate (Cambridge, MA: Berk-man Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, February 2016). 17  These vital requirements derive from the results of the 2015 SWP CyberLabs (see note 3). \n18  On the concept of responsibility in international relations, see the results of the conference on \u201cPolitik und Verantwortung\u201d (Frankfurt/Main, 10\u201312 February 2016), to be published in 2017 in a special issue of the Politische Vierteljahresschrift (PVS).

The openness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-mental prerequisite for states trusting one another so that they can deliver their individual contribu-tions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure cyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy to meet. In a technically challenging area such as international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, consultations often need to be confidential. Fur-thermore, the expertise of large companies almost inevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-dinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or members of parliament to be accepted as compe-tent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore required to prevent one-sided representations of interests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \n\uf034Through its international cyber policy, Germany intends to achieve effective collaboration on cyber-security in Europe and across the world. German measures to promote a free and secure Internet should therefore always be integrated at the Euro-pean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously claim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-tiating power on the global stage if it coordinates intensively with the leading European cybernations (France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such as the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber Issues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-ordinated at the European level can prevent global-isation and digitalisation from aggravating the symptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany that the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-space24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-fies that states should not merely orientate themselves along national interests, but also think in the catego-ries of global public good. Germany\u2019s tradition of \nindustry.21 civilian power25 is perpetuated in its international \nA maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign policy states that regulatory practices should be co-ordinated as closely as possible with its most impor-tant European partners.22 The internal market is so tightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 as indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that individual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are \n19  Christopher Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolg-reicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d, lecture given at the CyberLab of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy as well. \n\uf034The German Federal Republic has always held to the principle of generally pursuing its interests through economic and political rather than mili-tary means. In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-security policy is one that tries to civilise inter-national policy in cyberspace. That would mean internationalising socially accepted norms as much as possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of exceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-nated in entire passages of text from trade-association position papers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative act.

Military violence \u2013 including an active cyber-defence26 based on deterrence \u2013 could only be jus-tified at the national level in cases of self-defence and where it was coordinated with the EU and Nato member states on the one hand and was decided by the German Parliament. Responding to cyber attacks with automatic counterattacks and digital acts of reprisal would be extremely problematic. For one thing, any attempt to attribute cyber attacks un-equivocally raises all sorts of technical, legal and political questions; for another, counterattacks can have serious side-effects. Active cyberdefence might provoke a digital arms race \u2013 for instance through Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs27) \u2013 with incalcu-lable risks for fragile critical infrastructure. From a due diligence perspective, a strategy of \u201cdeterrence-by-resilience\u201d28 is therefore preferable. With their new IT-security law and the NIS (Network and Infor-mation Security) directive, Germany and the EU are leading by example in creating resilient infor-mation and communications structures in critical infrastructure and in setting minimum standards in IT security. Research into resilience, prevention, peace and conflict has a key role to play in cyber-security when it comes to civilising politics. \n\tIn due diligence, material and procedural contents merge into an overarching norm. For the purposes of \n26  Offensive strategies aim at \u201cattacking the systems of other states, sabotaging them, gaining control over them, rendering them inoperative or causing malfunctioning\u201d. But it is a matter of \u201csecuring and sustaining one\u2019s own IT structures and com-munications and weapons systems, and protecting them against being influenced or attacked, by using so-called defensive \napproaches.\u201d German Parliament, Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Dr. Alexander Neu u.a.: Krieg im \u201cCyber-Raum\u201d \u2013 offensive und defensive Cyberstrategie des Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung, Drucksache 18/6496 (Berlin, 16 October 2015).

This is about \u201cresist[ing] the securitisation of the Internet and of Internet \npolicy. The goal should not so much be security in abstracto as resilience, meaning the ability to with-stand shocks. And that can only be achieved through complex structures involving the whole of society\u201d.29 An international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy is based on a broad understanding of security and involves all stakeholders such as the state, academia, industry and society.30\n29  Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolgreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d (see note 19). \n30  The multi-stakeholder model was laid down as the foundation for Internet Governance at the World Summit on the Informa-tion Society (WSIS II) in Tunis in 2005. During the UN Summit held in December 2015 as part of the WSIS follow-up process, there was disagreement on how this model, which has been suc-cessfully used in the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), might be developed further. \nDue Diligence in Institutional Practice \nGerman policies are already beginning to take due diligence into account to some extent, but the norm is not yet sufficiently embedded in German institutions. \nFrom this perspective, the coherence and the consist-ency of content of Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy must be closely scrutinised. Its current institutional structure reflects the fact that the implementation of due diligence has already come a long way. The responsible authorities are now closely interconnected. However, it is also clear that much still needs to be improved with a view to European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response. \nInstitutional Structures \nThe German Federal Government has committed to creating a complete instrumentarium in coordination with the responsible state authorities to defend against cyber attacks.31 This is intended to contribute to guar-anteeing security provisions for the state as a whole. \nThe development of fully differentiated responsibili-ties is politically willed.32 Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy contains a whole series of cooperations, which essentially rest on five \ninfrastructure. It has an IT emergency team (CERT-Bund) at its disposal for this. The Federal Office fulfils its mission as \u201cthe central reporting office for security in Federal-Government IT\u201d, in charge of \u201crepelling harmful programmes and threats to the Federal Gov-ernment\u2019s communications technology\u201d, \u201cstipulating guidelines on security standards\u201d and providing cer-tifications.34 Because of the high quality of the BSI standard (ISO 27001) for promoting certified basic func-tions, and because of other recommendations, the BSI enjoys a high level of European and international recognition. For years, it has been involved in an in-tensive international exchange of experience and in-formation at the management and professional levels. \nAt the operations level, cooperation with other IT emergency teams is especially important. CERT-Bund belongs to the interdisciplinary International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN).35 At the domestic level, the BSI initiated the founding of the Allianz f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit (alliance for cybersecurity), which now pools German know-how on cybersecurity and has become the main point of contact for companies and citizens.36 The Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and the IT emergency team of the \npillars. German armed forces (CERTBw) work closely with \nthe BSI, in particular with its IT situation and analysis \nFirst Pillar: The Federal Office for Information Security In Germany, overall ministerial control over cyber-security issues rests with the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI).33 The Federal Office for Informa-tion Security (BSI) is the Federal Government\u2019s most important service provider in IT security. It reports to the BMI. The BSI is also responsible for operations to repel attacks against the Federal Government\u2019s IT \n31  German Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheits-\ncentre and the CERT-Bund team. \nSecond Pillar: The National Cyberdefence Centre \nA vital step towards implementing due diligence was taken in 2011 with the creation of the National Cyber-\ndefence Centre.37 This information platform is intended \n34  German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, \ned., Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik \n(BSI-Gesetz \u2013 BSIG), last modified on 17 July 2015, http://www. \ngesetze-im-internet.de/bsig_2009/BJNR282110009.html (accessed \nstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). 30 November 2015). \n32  In Norway, for instance, the national cybersecurity strategy is part of the portfolio of the ministry of justice.

The Centre is also part of the state\u2019s project-based collaboration with companies and service providers, and with foreign security ser-vices. The separation rule is a fundamental tenet of German federal legislation and stipulates that the tasks of the police and the intelligence services must be carried out by different, organisationally distinct authorities. Counter-intelligence is the purview of the BfV while the BKA is responsible for policing criminally motivated IT attacks. The technical information depart-ment (TA) of the Federal Intelligence Services (BND) retrieves information by technical means (Signals In-telligence or SIGINT); it obtains, in accordance with its official mandate, information that is significant for Germany\u2019s foreign and security policy; and it evalu-ates it.38 Using this information, the BND also sup-ports the German armed forces in their cyberdefence. \nThird Pillar: The National Cybersecurity Council \nWhen dealing with the challenges of cybersecurity, strong coordination with the state as a whole must be ensured.39 To this end, the interministerial National Cybersecurity Council, chaired by the Federal Com-missioner for Information Technology, brings together the secretaries of state.40 Furthermore, in Germany, IT security is a federal issue. The Cybersecurity Council consists of two federal-state representatives, repre-\n(BBK), domestic intelligence service (BfV), German Intelligence Services (BND), Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Customs Investigation Bureau (ZKA), Federal Police (BPol) and Armed Forces.

Since 2013, the Cybersecurity Council has been meet-ing three times a year. Fundamental issues of federal IT management and security are also dealt with in the interministerial council of IT commissioners (also called the IT Council). \nFourth Pillar: An International Cyber Policy \nGermany\u2019s 2011 cybersecurity strategy stipulates \nthe development of a targeted and coordinated inter-national cyber policy that makes it possible to take preventative measures for IT security in Germany, particularly to protect critical infrastructure and for international cooperation.41 This international cyber policy includes a representation of German interests with the EU and other international organisations and bodies, and in bilateral dialogues. In 2011, the Minis-try of Foreign Affairs created its coordination staff for international cyber policy.42 This staff serves as the interface between national ministerial policies on the one hand and the effort to coordinate the internation-al exertion of influence on the other hand, with the aim of creating a climate of security and trust, such as is indispensable for a defensive cybersecurity strategy. \nFifth Pillar: The German Armed Forces \nMeasures taken by the German military should be lim-ited to protecting their own capacity to act in accord-ance with their mandate, \u201cso as to embed cybersecurity as a part of the security provisions for the state as a whole\u201d.43 This is the responsibility of the German mili-\n41  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \n42  Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cyber-Au\u00dfenpolitik, http:// www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/GlobaleFragen/ Cyber-Aussenpolitik/KS_Cyber-Aussenpolitik_node.html (ac-cessed 5 February 2016). \n43  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie \n22 February 2016). f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n12\nInstitutional Structures \ntary\u2019s CNO forces,44 which are to be expanded further and to be used for active cyberdefence in future.45 This seems to indicate a potential paradigm change from defensive to offensive cyberprotection. In September 2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for cyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-try\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned for specific military cyber operations. There are also plans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) an expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-ment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose a risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for duty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-nent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence service\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider on security issues, and it advises and supports the German armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and on foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main bodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity strategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-ligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-mittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-tee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-mittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics of the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace makes no distinction between domestic and foreign policy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy and the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means of attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-puter programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, disrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications systems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-mation from data sources that are not publicly available. CNOs are therefore subdivided into Computer Network Attacks (CNA), Computer Network Defence (CND) and Computer Network \nExploitation (CNE). \n45  Federal Ministry of Defence, \u201cTagesbefehl der Ministerin: Bundeswehr wird im Cyber-Raum zukunftsf\u00e4hig\u201d (Berlin, 17 Sep-tember 2015). \nboth conceptually and institutionally. Domestic policy should be adjusted in accordance with due diligence. This is the only way of restoring the citizens\u2019, allies\u2019 and EU partners\u2019 trust lost during the Edward Snow-den leaks. Trust is an indispensable prerequisite for European cooperation and politics. However, the im-plementation of the three major challenges to an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 namely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-ian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to establish an overview of the cyber threat situation are unsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more successful, proposals have been put forward to trans-form the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-brella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently bring together all federal and state authorities. There are also calls for more cooperation between national and EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, such as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany not only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d frequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part of the European coordination. Moreover, vital coordi-nation at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because the attribution of specific responsibilities is so com-plicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, coalition partners have been discussing whether Ger-many needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital agency.50 However, they have only been able to agree on an office without power or resources: the office of Digital Champion of the Federal Government, cur-rently held by Gesche Joost. \n46  Ibid. 49  Since 2011, the European External Action Service has been \n47  Andre Meister, \u201cGeheime Cyber-Leitlinie: Verteidigungsminis-terium erlaubt Bundeswehr \u2018Cyberwar\u2019 und offensive digitale Angriffe\u201d, netzpolitik.org, 30 July 2015, https://netzpolitik.org/ 2015/geheime-cyber-leitlinie-verteidigungsministerium-erlaubt-bundeswehr-cyberwar-und-offensive-digitale-angriffe/ (accessed \nresponsible for the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), which produces civilian situation analyses for EU decision-makers based on material delivered by national intelligence services.

In part, these reforms have only become public knowledge through leaked docu-ments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-tional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February 2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-bohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views his links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times the resources available for the offensive approach than there are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks or compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a member of the executive board of the Federal Associa-tion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-tions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only one in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-cies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-nies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to contact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather than the police, since the latter would have to launch a preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act was suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-ing the intelligence services as well as improving par-liamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55\n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range launched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal netzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason. However, the case was dropped after political intervention.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-j\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated for regulating the exchange of information by intel-ligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to be created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-person for the armed forces.56\nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised that it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT security, but that the BMI had overall control on issues of cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being questioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. Even the National Cybersecurity Council has not been able to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient distribution of resposibilities. In July 2013, while eluci-dating the NSA affair, the German Federal Govern-ment did publish an eight-point programme on im-proving protection of the private sphere.57 However, the Cybersecurity Council did not publicly take a \nposition on the questionable practices of the security services \u2013 for instance, committing industrial espio-nage58 or keeping selector lists with spying targets.59\n56  Rudi Wais, \u201cSo k\u00f6nnte eine bessere Kontrolle der Nachrich-tendienste aussehen\u201d, Augsburger Allgemeine, 3 May 2015, http:// \n2015). www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/So-koennte-eine-bessere-\n52  Despite media claims to the contrary \u2013 see e.g. \u201cBundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) soll neue Bundes-beh\u00f6rde werden\u201d, Der Spiegel, 10 August 2014 \u2013 the BSI continues to report to the BMI.

The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal fund-ing to the tune of around 200 million euros from the BMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to make them competitive. It must be remembered that, \nof Private Actors to meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional structures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated capabilities in information and communications tech-nology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 Over the past few decades, automisation has allowed the German economy to respond well to the global \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated into European harmonisation and needs to focus on a defensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \npressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal \nMinistry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost small and medium enterprises using its Digital Strat-egy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily im-portant role in the Federal Government\u2019s international cybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in stra-tegic importance. The companies located there not only create jobs and added value, but also set com-petitivity standards for whole economies.61 The Ger-man Federal Government believes that there is still plenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: \naccording to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Net-works could generate overall benefits to German society worth 56 million euros a year.62 \nHowever, other countries have digitalised more successfully. The pioneering companies are mostly American, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the German Federal Government launched the pro-\ngrammes Digital Agenda and Digital Management.

Their special focus is first and foremost the German industrial policy. However, Industrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only be designed at the European or even global level.68 \tIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a strategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this market, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros to EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the Commission currently has only limited means avail-able for developing key digital technologies. The Con-necting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nthe legal status of its successor agreement between the EU and the US, the Privacy Shield, continues to be disputed.72 Furthermore, in late December 2015, the European Parliament, Council and Commission agreed a General Data Protection Regulation and a directive on network and information security.73 Industry repre-sentatives, however, view European harmonisation more critically. They consider the ECJ decisions and the Commission\u2019s legal initiatives to be \u201cusing politics for a digital industrial policy\u201d74 and to be protectionist. \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding Inclusiveness \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for research for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the Juncker Commission took up its posts in November 2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the help of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-mission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the market, as well as distributive policies should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the necessary speed is a problem, however, because the Commission first has to harmonise the legal policies of all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions published by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a European or transatlantic agreement on data-security and data protection policy.Important decisions in this context are those on the illegality of telecommunica-tions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and on the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, Industrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und forschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente Vernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache 18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nThe importance of private actors can also be seen in the fact that they run much critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, banks, energy concerns and water-works. Additionally, private actors often have the rele-vant knowledge for gauging threat levels and devel-oping tools to defend against threats. Only banks know how often they are attacked, and without infor-mation from industrial companies about espionage, no intelligence service can take meaningful counter-measures. Every act of regulation, development of standards and formulation of policy should therefore be carried out in solidarity with the private sector, if possible through public-private partnerships (PPP).

The direc-tive is intended to make IT more secure for operators of critical infrastructure and large online service pro-viders, and will oblige affected companies to report any security and data protection events or IT attacks. \ntives regularly get the opportunity for critical ques-tioning and for being involved in consulting process-es.78 It is part of due diligence that not only the \nnational and EU decisions but also the preparatory processes for decision-taking remain inclusive and open to the concerns of civil society, small and medium enterprises, and independent scholarship. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and Civilian Response \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-net. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-tration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, but not social networks. Small digital companies are also excluded. According to the directive, member states will have to build national reporting systems and exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-tent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-volved. The German Federal Government used the long negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a solution nationally with its industry, before the EU agreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed its IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced reporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and minimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-ture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-ties and private companies working in the area of critical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It is especially questionable whether the private sector can self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to become dependent on the interests of individual pri-vate actors to the point where they are barely able to act meaningfully without them.77 This dependency becomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these companies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO have so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy in these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-vidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on deterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-veillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-sions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-pretations could potentially result from this, since technical, political and legal reasons make it almost impossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, cyberinsecurity is growing within the international community. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-tect their citizens and data; and at the same time they have to regulate the digital sector, which is largely dominated by private companies. Creating universally secure components is considered extremely difficult, but where software is used by the state, transparency, testing and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce from this state of affairs which are the most important areas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-rights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, fighting cybercrime; and developing international norms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and in terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise from this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-sibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in the policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-es in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence means taking to heart the three demands of European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85\nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-ral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and security policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness. The examples listed only serve to illustrate the requirements named, which each policy would have to meet according to due diligence principles. 86  Ben Wagner, \u201cFreedom of Expression on the Internet: Implica-\nvery latest since the revelations made by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even western secret services carry out passive surveillance on a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly infiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organi-sations such as Freedom House with its annual study Freedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or activists for free software remind us again and again that governments and globally active IT corporations do not provide continual barrier-free Internet access across the world. These organisations claim, for \ninstance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only gives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand that Internet access should be a basic human right; at the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far from reaching a conclusion.87 \n\tIn a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights Council emphasised that human rights are valid in the same way online as they are offline.88 In November 2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in the digital age, in which, among other things, it pro-scribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic.89 In May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption of private communications to be made a standard. In early July of the same year, the UN Human Rights Council created the post of UN special rapporteur on privacy and appointed Joseph Cannataci of Malta.90\n87  Ben Wagner, \u201cK\u00f6nnt ihr mich h\u00f6ren?\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 15 September 2015. \n88  United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet, A/HRC/20/L.13 (New York, 29 June 2012), http://www. \nohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/ Session20/A.HRC.20.L.13_en.doc (accessed 9 December 2015). \n89  United Nations General Assembly, Third Committee Approves Text Titled \u201cRight to Privacy in the Digital Age\u201d, as It Takes Action on 18 Draft Resolutions, GA/SHC/4094 (New York, 26 November 2013), http://www.un.org/press/en/2013/gashc4094.doc.htm (accessed 9 December 2015). \n90  As early as 2014, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a comprehensive report on privacy in the digi-tal era.

One com-mentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the law\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between civil liberties and security measures during states of emergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-porteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to privacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the long term, integrated economic areas also need inte-grated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty gives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-dom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-ened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was legally binding on the EU and came into force at the same time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-gation on the EU to ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. What holds true for the single market also holds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where the transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU and USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy Shield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, which might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-vant data and information. Intensive cooperation among law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed to fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-ism, such as digital financial services providers, can only be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely on information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-ment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes and modernised mutual legal assistance agreements (MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive cooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the Purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, 27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-tive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n20\nprehensive cooperation between the security services (as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, however, be subject to more stringent parliamentary controls. It is not in the interests of due diligence to have secret services exchange their insights informally and, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for instance those stipulated in agreements providing for mutual legal assistance.94\nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human rights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to have laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, at least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-many and Europe, data protection is directly linked to the right to informational self-determination whereby citizens have a say in how their personal data may be used. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, because the state has a duty of protection towards its citizens that it must fulfil. Technically speaking, data protection and the state\u2019s protective duties associated with it differ by area: international economic inter-\nName Record Data for the Prevention, Detection, Investigation and Pros-ecution of Terrorist Offences and Serious Crime, 14670/15 (Brussels, 2 December 2015). \n93  This is the most significant secret-services cooperation in the world, between the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The new Regulation will have to be transposed directly into national law as of 2018. The GDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-lates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data processing by the police and judicial authorities of the EU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-on of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other uses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-known examples of this practice are the large digital-service providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-book, which store the data of European clients in the US using data protection provisions that violate Euro-pean law. Where there are grave violations of the data \n95  Alongside the relevant paragraphs in Germany\u2019s Basic Law, the legal bases can be found in the primary legislation on the security services, police and other authorities: Bundesdaten-schutzgesetz (BDSG), Telekommunikationsgesetz (TKG), Gesetz zur Beschr\u00e4nkung des Brief-, Post- und Fernmeldegeheimnisses (Artikel 10-Gesetz \u2013 G10), Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundeskriminalamt (BKAG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung des Bundesamtes f\u00fcr Sicher-heit in der Informationstechnik (BSIG), Gesetz \u00fcber das Zoll-kriminalamt und die Zollfahndungs\u00e4mter (Zollfahndungs-\ndienstgesetz \u2013 ZFdG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND-Gesetz \u2013 BNDG), Gesetz \u00fcber die Zusammenarbeit des Bun-des und der L\u00e4nder in Angelegenheiten des Verfassungsschutzes und \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (Bundesverfas-sungsschutzgesetz \u2013 BVerfSchG), Gesetz \u00fcber den Milit\u00e4rischen Abschirmdienst (MAD-Gesetz \u2013 MADG), Verordnung \u00fcber die \u00dcbermittlung von Ausk\u00fcnften an die Nachrichtendienste des Bundes (Nachrichtendienste-\u00dcbermittlungsverordnung \u2013 ND\u00dcV). 96  Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation), document 5455/16 \nThe data required to launch a criminal prosecution are not only generated through IT methods in the respective country. Any EU member state launching a prosecution will also always access data sources that were generated in allied states under different legal circumstances and do not meet the strict German or European requirements for data protection. While increased retention of data is viewed as an important instrument in fighting cybercrime, it has been inad-missible to inform on or survey transmission data generated in the past since the German Federal Court\u2019s decision of 2 March 2010. On 8 April 2014, the ECJ also quashed the EU directive on data retention, arguing that it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fun-damental Rights. A draft law presented by Federal Justice Minister Heiko Maas in 2015 intends to store the telecommunications data of all German citizens for 10 weeks.99 Technically, the instrument is already almost outdated. \n97  The federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information is expected to control the data protection efforts of telecommunications and postal services providers, federal agencies and other public federal offices.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-nal offences using intergovernmental agreements of individual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed is a process that involves all EU states and orientates itself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-ity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and political system still rests on criminal law applying and operating within national borders.

The EU should nevertheless con-centrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while applying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are a number of further meaningful initiatives, such as the European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-pean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual legal assistance agreements, including all relevant transatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies from relocating their business abroad and thus cir-cumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-security standards (the NIS directive) should be brought into line with those set in the US by the National Insti-tute of Standards.

Reconstruction and analysis \u2013 IT forensics \u2013 are thus the pivot of criminal prosecution.125 The German authorities, including the BKA and the state bureaux of investigation, therefore back the action plan of the European Police Office (Europol).126 Today, prosecut-ing authorities also systematically look for dangers in the IT system (threat hunting), instead of merely \nreacting to attacks. Where such a hunt is successful, attackers may be prevented from accessing the most sensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is stored in such a way that it can be used in court. \nGathering evidence from large and complex data \nbanks takes time and requires extremely powerful computers. Digital forensics face enormous challeng-es. That is why authorities bank on support from \nprivate IT forensic scientists to solve crimes. But \npublic-private cooperation on cybersecurity has its weak points, among other reasons because industry has so far not markedly got involved in fighting crime, except for the BSI initiative Allianz f\u00fcr Cyber-\nSicherheit and for CERT exchanges. The Global Player Initiative is a network founded back in 2006, in which the BKA and (currently) 62 large enterprises partici-pate. Overall, the BKA cooperates with about 630 \ncompanies. Frequently, this exchange of information is still more of a one-way street, because small and \nInclusiveness medium enterprises in particular do not have the \ncapacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \nSecurity agencies on the EU and national levels will have to get used to the fact that the fight against cybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-tion of private actors. A clear separation between private and public sector can hardly be upheld in this area, because the companies that have been attacked are frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nIn Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are obliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \nminimum security standards for their IT.

According to the strategy the relevant agencies need to be given more supranational com-petences and more funds. These include Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)128; the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA); and the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust). The cyberexercises that are regularly co-ordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they are important for building resilient IT structures in accordance with due diligence. 29 EU-EFTA member states and 200 governmental organisations participated in the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise.129 The exercise was designed to test how to improve cooperation between states in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the whole of Europe; how the many parallel communica-tions relations impact on generating an overview of the national and European situation; and what con-sequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might have for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. At the operative level, the continuous cooperation of the IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispen-sable. The BSI, for instance, is a member of the Euro-pean Government CERTs Group (EGC), an informal group at the European level, and of the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), an in-ternational coalition of about 200 state and private \nfor codifying the right to war (ius ad bellum) and the law of war (ius in bello) for cyberspace.131 Its authors also attempted to elaborate how due diligence might be best served in cyberspace. For example, the Tallinn Manual states that \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.\u201d \tIn line with its constitutional obligation to defend the Alliance, the German military also primarily has defensive cybercapabilities, meaning that it is geared for cyberdefence.132 Cyberdefence includes measures for repelling threats not just against individual per-sons or enterprises but also against the state and its social foundations. The German armed forces view themselves as the central instance for repelling exter-nal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-many\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use and the German share of cyberspace are also part of cyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not only that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out in cyberspace, but also that military deployments are occurring below the threshold of armed conflict and that non-state actors are involved. The German Federal Government therefore explicitly points out that mili-tary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nCERTS.130 Germany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the Alliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of German academics, the Centre presented proposals \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. europa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA CE2014.

Every year, NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which has also been entrusted with operative IT security and network surveillance, organises its three-day Cyber Coalition.137 The NCIRC Coordination Centre is responsible for coordinating with member states and partner organisations for this event, such as the EU, OSCE or International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

If these preconditions are met, it is legally possible to take damaging (counter-)measures against an attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gather-ing and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German armed forces can use their own capacities to protect the whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this is Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the armed forces to repel and cope with a particularly grave incident. However, each armed deployment of German military forces requires the assent of the Ger-man Parliament under a law known as the Parlaments-beteiligungsgesetz.140 In developing a German cyber-defence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early on about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal precondition of parliamentary approval that exists in Germany is a major asset that must not carelessly be sacrificed to technological progress. In this context, there needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval after the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal Constitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah deci-sion141 in the summer of 2015.

The EU states involved should focus their energies on giving EU con-cerns more emphasis in the GGE in future, as stipulated in the Council\u2019s conclusions on cyberdiplomacy.152 In this, the EU needs to speak \u201cwith one voice\u201d, because \nence in arms control and confidence-building that span opposing blocs, the German OSCE chairmanship is developing CSBMs in all three areas for cyberspace. \nThe OSCE is a regional approach that complements and supplements the work of the GGE.

The first steps have been taken towards intro-ducing international export-control mechanisms and incorporate surveillance technologies in sanctions packages. These approaches could be continued, at least on the regional level, using the EU\u2019s dual-use regulation.158 In particular, the export of such prod-ucts to countries with authoritarian regimes needs to be more strictly prohibited than before. To this end, a standardised definition of cyberweapons must be elaborated and monitoring regimes be conceived at the EU and UN levels.159 For the time being, it is un-likely that governments will conclude multilateral international-law treaties, which provide a binding \nespionage and other military purposes, such as hybrid warfare. Dual-use technology is an awkward subject in the cooperation between civilian and military actors as well as between public and private actors, especially in the transatlantic alliance. Euro-Atlantic cooperation would be a good prelude to committing states within the EU and NATO to reporting weak points in IT prod-ucts to the manufacturers, rather than deliberately building in backdoors.

As a European middle-size power, Germany will only be able to find this new focus in a perspective that is in keeping with its integration in European Union, democratic values and firm commit-ment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence norm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary institutional structures in the medium term to guar-antee that the norm is being applied effectively.

Modern (cyber) foreign and security policies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-gence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental idea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility for threats that emanate from their territory and must do everything in their power in cooperation with other EU states and allies to prevent damage to third parties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-tures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and bring together a great number of interested parties. In digital industrial policy cooperation between state and private actors with the aim of pooling profession-al expertise is needed to give due diligence greater weight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence of civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for improving Germany\u2019s International and European cyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly enforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal standard and is not included as a binding regulation in bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final report of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, the represented states commit to stopping attacks that emanate from their territories and also commit to not deliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-structure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-crime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a promising step that can serve as a model for bilateral agreements between other countries. Here, it will be important to work politically towards a general recog-\nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-security policy should be formulated even more strong-ly inside EU structures. Only because of the European single market is Germany able to act with the neces-sary vigour on the international stage. A promising starting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group (FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support the implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-zontally at the EU level. While the working group has so far only been set up for three years at a time, it has already become the most important hub for coordi-nating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU and USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-national norms. Where they agree, they have enough political influence to tilt the scales towards a more effective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently needed now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-tion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally attributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently use this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by shifting the blame onto third parties. In line with the TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer and a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance need to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-tion Regulation should quickly be complemented by Privacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets the legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-tion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account the legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision of October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-panies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data being stored and evaluated according to US law. How-\nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n31\n(Improving) The Implementation of Due Diligence \never, it has also set a questionable precedent of extra-territorial applicability of its legislation \u2013 despite having previously criticised the US for such practices. \nIn practice, global companies now store any data of European citizens in Europe to prevent clashing with EU law. With this decision, the EU will applys its own law on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial effects of national law contradict the principle of due diligence obligations. States such as the US and China are likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-ing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This could result in a collision course for different national legal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-tion of the global economic space and the Internet. The Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-tic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are therefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed on those states which have been attacked, on whose territory the servers are located, or over whose data cables attacks are carried out. The density of these obligations should depend on the ability of the states in questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-ities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-tive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, IT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further development and use of cyberdefence systems. How-ever, this should be coordinated at the European level, approved by politically independent or parliamentary decisions, and remain committed to an exclusively defensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct would run counter to due diligence and would also break with the tradition of military restraint in for-eign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in all issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-rity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-ment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as part of their cyberdefence, the political change of course that might be required for this would need to be debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-supposes social resilience, which can only be created through public debate. This also includes carrying out a reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-ment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. It will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-tures for parliamentary oversight. \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point. This would also reduce legal un-\ncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must \nbe possible to force companies to make their software \nproducts more secure. At the very least, the criteria for \ntransparency, testing and certification must be made \nmore stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA. \nFourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected \nweapons systems and the high quality that detected \ncyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity \nknow-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to \ntake data security into account at the design stage of \nany system architecture. It therefore stands to reason \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n32\nList of Abbreviations \n\tMultistakeholder Approach to Promote Democracy \n\tand Human Rights, Sound Technological Archi-\n\ttecture, Confidence and Transparent Governance \nCSBM \tConfidence- and security-building measures \nCSDP \tCommon Security and Defence Policy \nCSIRT \n\tComputer Security Incident Response Team ECJ \tEuropean Court of Justice \nEEAS \tEuropean External Action Service \nEFTA \tEuropean Free Trade Association \nEGC \n\tEuropean Government CERTs Group ENISA \tEuropean Network and Information Security \n\tAgency \nEU \tEuropean Union \nEurojust \tEuropean Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit \nEuropol \tEuropean Police Office \nFIRST \tForum for Incident Response and Security Teams \nFoP \tFriends of the Presidency Group on Cyber Issues \nGDPR \tGeneral Data Protection Regulation (EU) \nGGE \tGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments \n\tin the Field of Information and Telecommunica-\n\ttions in the Context of International Security (UN) \nIANA \tInternet Assigned Numbers Authority \nICANN \tInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and \n\tNumbers \nICT \tInformation and communication technology \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n33"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

To create and preserve the Internet as a \npublic good, concerted global action is needed on the \nbasis of a common norm, which makes states mutu-\nally responsible for their diligence in national regula-\ntory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in \nthe German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as \nthe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides \nfor civil, police and military-defensive approaches to \nprotecting information-technology (IT) systems and \ninfrastructure. \nIn the course of the discussion about a new German \ncybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn \nof this year, a growing number of political voices have \nalso argued that political regulation and digital sover-\neignty should be strengthened and renationalised. Poli-\ntics must face up to the reality of the military becom-\ning increasingly operative in cyberspace. This will be \nreflected in the German Federal Government\u2019s new \nWhite Paper as well as in NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s future \ncyberdefence. In other words, it will be implemented \nin the German and European security policy as well as \nin their defence missions and military procurement. \nLiberal democracies need to be aware that the idea \nof a free and open Internet can only be realized if \nthere is consensus among a \u201ccoalition of liberal states\u201d \nnot only on how the Internet should be governend but \nwhy International and transatlantic cooperation is \nmeaningful. German and European policy should go \nahead and orientate itself on the norm of due dili-\ngence in cyberspace \u2013 and do so in an interministerial \nway \u2013 so as to enforce it internationally. Due diligence \nin cyberspace builds on the international legal stand-\nard of due diligence, which stipulates that a state \nmust do everything necessary to prevent actions ema-\nnating from within its own territory that might in-\nfringe the rights of third parties. In the Organisation \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), \nfor instance, there is far-reaching consensus on due \ndiligence, which would be an obvious choice for the \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n5\nIssues and Recommendations \nnormative basis for a global cyber order.

In addition, it would \n\uf034Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-ponent over the military component, particularly \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-ing on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \nin times of peace. operators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states behave responsibly not only towards one another, but also in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. The EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided for this. As part of implementing the EU directive on network and information security (NIS), all EU states must introduce minimum standards and reporting requirements for IT security, and operators of critical infrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national regulations in civil law (data protection), commercial law (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-mestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-fil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, it will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned Global Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members largely agree that states are responsible for their own behaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation among Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as well as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE negotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-crime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The minimum conditions for global cybersecurity are ratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as well as continuous confidence- and security-building measures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, which was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) follow-up process, showed that a worldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-erly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-gy to protect the economy and industry against espio-nage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-bilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense indicates that it wants to build additional defensive capabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not be advisable for the government to evolve towards an offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in open contradiction with the idea of due diligence in cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the risk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber attacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-cult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause serious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on the German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is to persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring a given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse to NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against Islamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last resorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to prop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-rity technology, for developing digital forensics, and for extensive further-training measures to heighten awareness among civil servants, scientists, academics and researchers. Confidence-building measures within the OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under the leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-sified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving bilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-ing and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and remove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of this is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term.

According to the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-tories, and especially the computersystems and infra-structure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 control, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-ture of other states.13 \n\tDue diligence is usually translated in international law treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-pflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions on one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful to use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The principle of due diligence derives its particular norma-tive force from the idea that states are not only respon-sible for keeping law and order on their own territories, but also bear responsibility for the external consequences of \n10  International Court of Justice, \u201cCase Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Decisions taken by individual states increasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-ritory. That is why states must exercise care with such decisions and be accountable to one another for them. As far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply limit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. This study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-net needs to the political will by all stakeholders for international cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in cooperation with other states are obliged to do every-thing that may be reasonably expected of them to help deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \n\t\tThis expectation encompasses decision-making processes that meet high standards. This means that available competences should be integrated as far as possible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics should be avoided.16 In other words, an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due diligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode of regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated at the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated into inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17\uf034Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \t\twith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\t\tness as well as transparency. As Christopher Daase \t\tpointed out: \u201cIn democracies, in the long term, no \t\tpolicy can be pushed through against the will of \t\tthe majority and not even against the resistance of \n15  The collaboration of IT emergency teams (Computer Emer-gency Response Team, CERT) in the CyberGreen project (www. \ncybergreen.net) could serve as a model. Here, CERTs from the Pacific Region states as well as Japan and China work together to ensure a \u201cgreen cyberspace\u201d.They perceive themselves as strictly technical, but the project is nevertheless based on the idea of jointly identifying and rectifying weak areas, such as malware or vulnerable networks. \n16  An example is the debate about communications encryption and the divergent positions of the security agencies on the one hand and industry representatives on the other hand. On this point, see also Berklett Cybersecurity Project, ed., Don\u2019t Panic: Making Progress on the \u201cGoing Dark\u201d Debate (Cambridge, MA: Berk-man Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, February 2016). 17  These vital requirements derive from the results of the 2015 SWP CyberLabs (see note 3). \n18  On the concept of responsibility in international relations, see the results of the conference on \u201cPolitik und Verantwortung\u201d (Frankfurt/Main, 10\u201312 February 2016), to be published in 2017 in a special issue of the Politische Vierteljahresschrift (PVS).

The openness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-mental prerequisite for states trusting one another so that they can deliver their individual contribu-tions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure cyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy to meet. In a technically challenging area such as international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, consultations often need to be confidential. Fur-thermore, the expertise of large companies almost inevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-dinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or members of parliament to be accepted as compe-tent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore required to prevent one-sided representations of interests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \n\uf034Through its international cyber policy, Germany intends to achieve effective collaboration on cyber-security in Europe and across the world. German measures to promote a free and secure Internet should therefore always be integrated at the Euro-pean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously claim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-tiating power on the global stage if it coordinates intensively with the leading European cybernations (France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such as the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber Issues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-ordinated at the European level can prevent global-isation and digitalisation from aggravating the symptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany that the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-space24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-fies that states should not merely orientate themselves along national interests, but also think in the catego-ries of global public good.

In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-security policy is one that tries to civilise inter-national policy in cyberspace. That would mean internationalising socially accepted norms as much as possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of exceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-nated in entire passages of text from trade-association position papers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative act.

Military violence \u2013 including an active cyber-defence26 based on deterrence \u2013 could only be jus-tified at the national level in cases of self-defence and where it was coordinated with the EU and Nato member states on the one hand and was decided by the German Parliament. Responding to cyber attacks with automatic counterattacks and digital acts of reprisal would be extremely problematic. For one thing, any attempt to attribute cyber attacks un-equivocally raises all sorts of technical, legal and political questions; for another, counterattacks can have serious side-effects. Active cyberdefence might provoke a digital arms race \u2013 for instance through Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs27) \u2013 with incalcu-lable risks for fragile critical infrastructure. From a due diligence perspective, a strategy of \u201cdeterrence-by-resilience\u201d28 is therefore preferable. With their new IT-security law and the NIS (Network and Infor-mation Security) directive, Germany and the EU are leading by example in creating resilient infor-mation and communications structures in critical infrastructure and in setting minimum standards in IT security. Research into resilience, prevention, peace and conflict has a key role to play in cyber-security when it comes to civilising politics. \n\tIn due diligence, material and procedural contents merge into an overarching norm. For the purposes of \n26  Offensive strategies aim at \u201cattacking the systems of other states, sabotaging them, gaining control over them, rendering them inoperative or causing malfunctioning\u201d. But it is a matter of \u201csecuring and sustaining one\u2019s own IT structures and com-munications and weapons systems, and protecting them against being influenced or attacked, by using so-called defensive \napproaches.\u201d German Parliament, Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Dr. Alexander Neu u.a.: Krieg im \u201cCyber-Raum\u201d \u2013 offensive und defensive Cyberstrategie des Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung, Drucksache 18/6496 (Berlin, 16 October 2015).

This is about \u201cresist[ing] the securitisation of the Internet and of Internet \npolicy. The goal should not so much be security in abstracto as resilience, meaning the ability to with-stand shocks. And that can only be achieved through complex structures involving the whole of society\u201d.29 An international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy is based on a broad understanding of security and involves all stakeholders such as the state, academia, industry and society.30\n29  Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolgreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d (see note 19). \n30  The multi-stakeholder model was laid down as the foundation for Internet Governance at the World Summit on the Informa-tion Society (WSIS II) in Tunis in 2005. During the UN Summit held in December 2015 as part of the WSIS follow-up process, there was disagreement on how this model, which has been suc-cessfully used in the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), might be developed further. \nDue Diligence in Institutional Practice \nGerman policies are already beginning to take due diligence into account to some extent, but the norm is not yet sufficiently embedded in German institutions. \nFrom this perspective, the coherence and the consist-ency of content of Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy must be closely scrutinised. Its current institutional structure reflects the fact that the implementation of due diligence has already come a long way. The responsible authorities are now closely interconnected. However, it is also clear that much still needs to be improved with a view to European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response. \nInstitutional Structures \nThe German Federal Government has committed to creating a complete instrumentarium in coordination with the responsible state authorities to defend against cyber attacks.31 This is intended to contribute to guar-anteeing security provisions for the state as a whole. \nThe development of fully differentiated responsibili-ties is politically willed.32 Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy contains a whole series of cooperations, which essentially rest on five \ninfrastructure. It has an IT emergency team (CERT-Bund) at its disposal for this. The Federal Office fulfils its mission as \u201cthe central reporting office for security in Federal-Government IT\u201d, in charge of \u201crepelling harmful programmes and threats to the Federal Gov-ernment\u2019s communications technology\u201d, \u201cstipulating guidelines on security standards\u201d and providing cer-tifications.34 Because of the high quality of the BSI standard (ISO 27001) for promoting certified basic func-tions, and because of other recommendations, the BSI enjoys a high level of European and international recognition. For years, it has been involved in an in-tensive international exchange of experience and in-formation at the management and professional levels. \nAt the operations level, cooperation with other IT emergency teams is especially important. CERT-Bund belongs to the interdisciplinary International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN).35 At the domestic level, the BSI initiated the founding of the Allianz f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit (alliance for cybersecurity), which now pools German know-how on cybersecurity and has become the main point of contact for companies and citizens.36 The Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and the IT emergency team of the \npillars. German armed forces (CERTBw) work closely with \nthe BSI, in particular with its IT situation and analysis \nFirst Pillar: The Federal Office for Information Security In Germany, overall ministerial control over cyber-security issues rests with the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI).33 The Federal Office for Informa-tion Security (BSI) is the Federal Government\u2019s most important service provider in IT security. It reports to the BMI. The BSI is also responsible for operations to repel attacks against the Federal Government\u2019s IT \n31  German Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheits-\ncentre and the CERT-Bund team. \nSecond Pillar: The National Cyberdefence Centre \nA vital step towards implementing due diligence was taken in 2011 with the creation of the National Cyber-\ndefence Centre.37 This information platform is intended \n34  German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, \ned., Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik \n(BSI-Gesetz \u2013 BSIG), last modified on 17 July 2015, http://www. \ngesetze-im-internet.de/bsig_2009/BJNR282110009.html (accessed \nstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). 30 November 2015). \n32  In Norway, for instance, the national cybersecurity strategy is part of the portfolio of the ministry of justice.

The Centre is also part of the state\u2019s project-based collaboration with companies and service providers, and with foreign security ser-vices. The separation rule is a fundamental tenet of German federal legislation and stipulates that the tasks of the police and the intelligence services must be carried out by different, organisationally distinct authorities. Counter-intelligence is the purview of the BfV while the BKA is responsible for policing criminally motivated IT attacks. The technical information depart-ment (TA) of the Federal Intelligence Services (BND) retrieves information by technical means (Signals In-telligence or SIGINT); it obtains, in accordance with its official mandate, information that is significant for Germany\u2019s foreign and security policy; and it evalu-ates it.38 Using this information, the BND also sup-ports the German armed forces in their cyberdefence. \nThird Pillar: The National Cybersecurity Council \nWhen dealing with the challenges of cybersecurity, strong coordination with the state as a whole must be ensured.39 To this end, the interministerial National Cybersecurity Council, chaired by the Federal Com-missioner for Information Technology, brings together the secretaries of state.40 Furthermore, in Germany, IT security is a federal issue. The Cybersecurity Council consists of two federal-state representatives, repre-\n(BBK), domestic intelligence service (BfV), German Intelligence Services (BND), Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Customs Investigation Bureau (ZKA), Federal Police (BPol) and Armed Forces.

Since 2013, the Cybersecurity Council has been meet-ing three times a year. Fundamental issues of federal IT management and security are also dealt with in the interministerial council of IT commissioners (also called the IT Council). \nFourth Pillar: An International Cyber Policy \nGermany\u2019s 2011 cybersecurity strategy stipulates \nthe development of a targeted and coordinated inter-national cyber policy that makes it possible to take preventative measures for IT security in Germany, particularly to protect critical infrastructure and for international cooperation.41 This international cyber policy includes a representation of German interests with the EU and other international organisations and bodies, and in bilateral dialogues. In 2011, the Minis-try of Foreign Affairs created its coordination staff for international cyber policy.42 This staff serves as the interface between national ministerial policies on the one hand and the effort to coordinate the internation-al exertion of influence on the other hand, with the aim of creating a climate of security and trust, such as is indispensable for a defensive cybersecurity strategy. \nFifth Pillar: The German Armed Forces \nMeasures taken by the German military should be lim-ited to protecting their own capacity to act in accord-ance with their mandate, \u201cso as to embed cybersecurity as a part of the security provisions for the state as a whole\u201d.43 This is the responsibility of the German mili-\n41  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \n42  Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cyber-Au\u00dfenpolitik, http:// www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/GlobaleFragen/ Cyber-Aussenpolitik/KS_Cyber-Aussenpolitik_node.html (ac-cessed 5 February 2016). \n43  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie \n22 February 2016). f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n12\nInstitutional Structures \ntary\u2019s CNO forces,44 which are to be expanded further and to be used for active cyberdefence in future.45 This seems to indicate a potential paradigm change from defensive to offensive cyberprotection. In September 2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for cyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-try\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned for specific military cyber operations. There are also plans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) an expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-ment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose a risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for duty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-nent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence service\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider on security issues, and it advises and supports the German armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and on foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main bodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity strategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-ligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-mittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-tee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-mittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics of the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace makes no distinction between domestic and foreign policy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy and the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means of attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-puter programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, disrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications systems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-mation from data sources that are not publicly available. CNOs are therefore subdivided into Computer Network Attacks (CNA), Computer Network Defence (CND) and Computer Network \nExploitation (CNE). \n45  Federal Ministry of Defence, \u201cTagesbefehl der Ministerin: Bundeswehr wird im Cyber-Raum zukunftsf\u00e4hig\u201d (Berlin, 17 Sep-tember 2015). \nboth conceptually and institutionally. Domestic policy should be adjusted in accordance with due diligence. This is the only way of restoring the citizens\u2019, allies\u2019 and EU partners\u2019 trust lost during the Edward Snow-den leaks. Trust is an indispensable prerequisite for European cooperation and politics. However, the im-plementation of the three major challenges to an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 namely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-ian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to establish an overview of the cyber threat situation are unsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more successful, proposals have been put forward to trans-form the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-brella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently bring together all federal and state authorities. There are also calls for more cooperation between national and EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, such as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany not only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d frequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part of the European coordination. Moreover, vital coordi-nation at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because the attribution of specific responsibilities is so com-plicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, coalition partners have been discussing whether Ger-many needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital agency.50 However, they have only been able to agree on an office without power or resources: the office of Digital Champion of the Federal Government, cur-rently held by Gesche Joost. \n46  Ibid. 49  Since 2011, the European External Action Service has been \n47  Andre Meister, \u201cGeheime Cyber-Leitlinie: Verteidigungsminis-terium erlaubt Bundeswehr \u2018Cyberwar\u2019 und offensive digitale Angriffe\u201d, netzpolitik.org, 30 July 2015, https://netzpolitik.org/ 2015/geheime-cyber-leitlinie-verteidigungsministerium-erlaubt-bundeswehr-cyberwar-und-offensive-digitale-angriffe/ (accessed \nresponsible for the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), which produces civilian situation analyses for EU decision-makers based on material delivered by national intelligence services.

In part, these reforms have only become public knowledge through leaked docu-ments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-tional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February 2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-bohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views his links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times the resources available for the offensive approach than there are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks or compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a member of the executive board of the Federal Associa-tion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-tions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only one in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-cies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-nies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to contact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather than the police, since the latter would have to launch a preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act was suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-ing the intelligence services as well as improving par-liamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55\n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range launched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal netzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-j\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated for regulating the exchange of information by intel-ligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to be created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-person for the armed forces.56\nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised that it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT security, but that the BMI had overall control on issues of cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being questioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. Even the National Cybersecurity Council has not been able to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient distribution of resposibilities.

Many observers had expected a more proportionate reaction to the attack on Germany\u2019s highest constitutional body. \nDigital Industrial Policy and the Importance \ncompared with the US government\u2019s programmes for funding research projects, for instance on developing quantum computers or the capability of analysing big-data. The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal fund-ing to the tune of around 200 million euros from the BMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to make them competitive. It must be remembered that, \nof Private Actors to meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional structures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated capabilities in information and communications tech-nology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 Over the past few decades, automisation has allowed the German economy to respond well to the global \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated into European harmonisation and needs to focus on a defensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \npressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal \nMinistry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost small and medium enterprises using its Digital Strat-egy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily im-portant role in the Federal Government\u2019s international cybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in stra-tegic importance. The companies located there not only create jobs and added value, but also set com-petitivity standards for whole economies.61 The Ger-man Federal Government believes that there is still plenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: \naccording to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Net-works could generate overall benefits to German society worth 56 million euros a year.62 \nHowever, other countries have digitalised more successfully. The pioneering companies are mostly American, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the German Federal Government launched the pro-\ngrammes Digital Agenda and Digital Management. However, these programmes are meagrely equipped \nJelpke, weiterer Abgeordneter und der Fraktion Die Linke.

Their special focus is first and foremost the German industrial policy. However, Industrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only be designed at the European or even global level.68 \tIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a strategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this market, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros to EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the Commission currently has only limited means avail-able for developing key digital technologies. The Con-necting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nthe legal status of its successor agreement between the EU and the US, the Privacy Shield, continues to be disputed.72 Furthermore, in late December 2015, the European Parliament, Council and Commission agreed a General Data Protection Regulation and a directive on network and information security.73 Industry repre-sentatives, however, view European harmonisation more critically. They consider the ECJ decisions and the Commission\u2019s legal initiatives to be \u201cusing politics for a digital industrial policy\u201d74 and to be protectionist. \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding Inclusiveness \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for research for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the Juncker Commission took up its posts in November 2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the help of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-mission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the market, as well as distributive policies should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the necessary speed is a problem, however, because the Commission first has to harmonise the legal policies of all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions published by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a European or transatlantic agreement on data-security and data protection policy.Important decisions in this context are those on the illegality of telecommunica-tions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and on the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, Industrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und forschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente Vernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache 18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nThe importance of private actors can also be seen in the fact that they run much critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, banks, energy concerns and water-works. Additionally, private actors often have the rele-vant knowledge for gauging threat levels and devel-oping tools to defend against threats. Only banks know how often they are attacked, and without infor-mation from industrial companies about espionage, no intelligence service can take meaningful counter-measures. Every act of regulation, development of standards and formulation of policy should therefore be carried out in solidarity with the private sector, if possible through public-private partnerships (PPP).

The direc-tive is intended to make IT more secure for operators of critical infrastructure and large online service pro-viders, and will oblige affected companies to report any security and data protection events or IT attacks. \ntives regularly get the opportunity for critical ques-tioning and for being involved in consulting process-es.78 It is part of due diligence that not only the \nnational and EU decisions but also the preparatory processes for decision-taking remain inclusive and open to the concerns of civil society, small and medium enterprises, and independent scholarship. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and Civilian Response \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-net. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-tration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, but not social networks. Small digital companies are also excluded. According to the directive, member states will have to build national reporting systems and exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-tent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-volved. The German Federal Government used the long negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a solution nationally with its industry, before the EU agreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed its IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced reporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and minimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-ture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-ties and private companies working in the area of critical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It is especially questionable whether the private sector can self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to become dependent on the interests of individual pri-vate actors to the point where they are barely able to act meaningfully without them.77 This dependency becomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these companies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO have so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy in these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-vidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on deterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-veillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-sions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-pretations could potentially result from this, since technical, political and legal reasons make it almost impossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, cyberinsecurity is growing within the international community. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-tect their citizens and data; and at the same time they have to regulate the digital sector, which is largely dominated by private companies. Creating universally secure components is considered extremely difficult, but where software is used by the state, transparency, testing and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce from this state of affairs which are the most important areas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-rights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, fighting cybercrime; and developing international norms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and in terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise from this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-sibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in the policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-es in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence means taking to heart the three demands of European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85\nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-ral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and security policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness. The examples listed only serve to illustrate the requirements named, which each policy would have to meet according to due diligence principles. 86  Ben Wagner, \u201cFreedom of Expression on the Internet: Implica-\nvery latest since the revelations made by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even western secret services carry out passive surveillance on a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly infiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organi-sations such as Freedom House with its annual study Freedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or activists for free software remind us again and again that governments and globally active IT corporations do not provide continual barrier-free Internet access across the world. These organisations claim, for \ninstance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only gives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand that Internet access should be a basic human right; at the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far from reaching a conclusion.87 \n\tIn a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights Council emphasised that human rights are valid in the same way online as they are offline.88 In November 2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in the digital age, in which, among other things, it pro-scribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic.89 In May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption of private communications to be made a standard. In early July of the same year, the UN Human Rights Council created the post of UN special rapporteur on privacy and appointed Joseph Cannataci of Malta.90\n87  Ben Wagner, \u201cK\u00f6nnt ihr mich h\u00f6ren?\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 15 September 2015. \n88  United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet, A/HRC/20/L.13 (New York, 29 June 2012), http://www. \nohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/ Session20/A.HRC.20.L.13_en.doc (accessed 9 December 2015). \n89  United Nations General Assembly, Third Committee Approves Text Titled \u201cRight to Privacy in the Digital Age\u201d, as It Takes Action on 18 Draft Resolutions, GA/SHC/4094 (New York, 26 November 2013), http://www.un.org/press/en/2013/gashc4094.doc.htm (accessed 9 December 2015). \n90  As early as 2014, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a comprehensive report on privacy in the digi-tal era.

One com-mentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the law\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between civil liberties and security measures during states of emergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-porteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to privacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the long term, integrated economic areas also need inte-grated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty gives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-dom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-ened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was legally binding on the EU and came into force at the same time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-gation on the EU to ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. What holds true for the single market also holds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where the transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU and USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy Shield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, which might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-vant data and information. Intensive cooperation among law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed to fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-ism, such as digital financial services providers, can only be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely on information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-ment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes and modernised mutual legal assistance agreements (MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive cooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the Purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, 27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-tive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n20\nprehensive cooperation between the security services (as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, however, be subject to more stringent parliamentary controls. It is not in the interests of due diligence to have secret services exchange their insights informally and, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for instance those stipulated in agreements providing for mutual legal assistance.94\nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human rights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to have laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, at least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-many and Europe, data protection is directly linked to the right to informational self-determination whereby citizens have a say in how their personal data may be used. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, because the state has a duty of protection towards its citizens that it must fulfil.

The new Regulation will have to be transposed directly into national law as of 2018. The GDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-lates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data processing by the police and judicial authorities of the EU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-on of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other uses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-known examples of this practice are the large digital-service providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-book, which store the data of European clients in the US using data protection provisions that violate Euro-pean law.

Much work is being carried out on encryption technologies to make this task more difficult.118 Users themselves play a decisive role in civilising communications. They can exert pressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated and fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes sense for the Internet Governance committees to dis-cuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It would be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet Governance or to allow states to exert increasing \ninfluence over it, with the exception of state bodies wanting to comply with due diligence.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-nal offences using intergovernmental agreements of individual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed is a process that involves all EU states and orientates itself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-ity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and political system still rests on criminal law applying and operating within national borders. At the same time, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access rights because cloud services, for example, operate beyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-centrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while applying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are a number of further meaningful initiatives, such as the European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-pean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual legal assistance agreements, including all relevant transatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies from relocating their business abroad and thus cir-cumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-security standards (the NIS directive) should be brought into line with those set in the US by the National Insti-tute of Standards. Transatlantic cooperation has an important role to play not only in public-private part-nerships, but also at the official level, for instance in the EU-US working group on fighting cybercrime.123\nnets.124 While it remains difficult to attribute cyber attacks unequivocally \u2013 for instance, because of falsi-fied invoices, sabotaged computer systems and pass-word theft \u2013 perpetrators nonetheless leave digital traces. Reconstruction and analysis \u2013 IT forensics \u2013 are thus the pivot of criminal prosecution.125 The German authorities, including the BKA and the state bureaux of investigation, therefore back the action plan of the European Police Office (Europol).126 Today, prosecut-ing authorities also systematically look for dangers in the IT system (threat hunting), instead of merely \nreacting to attacks. Where such a hunt is successful, attackers may be prevented from accessing the most sensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is stored in such a way that it can be used in court. \nGathering evidence from large and complex data \nbanks takes time and requires extremely powerful computers. Digital forensics face enormous challeng-es. That is why authorities bank on support from \nprivate IT forensic scientists to solve crimes. But \npublic-private cooperation on cybersecurity has its weak points, among other reasons because industry has so far not markedly got involved in fighting crime, except for the BSI initiative Allianz f\u00fcr Cyber-\nSicherheit and for CERT exchanges. The Global Player Initiative is a network founded back in 2006, in which the BKA and (currently) 62 large enterprises partici-pate. Overall, the BKA cooperates with about 630 \ncompanies. Frequently, this exchange of information is still more of a one-way street, because small and \nInclusiveness medium enterprises in particular do not have the \ncapacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \nSecurity agencies on the EU and national levels will have to get used to the fact that the fight against cybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-tion of private actors. A clear separation between private and public sector can hardly be upheld in this area, because the companies that have been attacked are frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nIn Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are obliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \nminimum security standards for their IT.

For example, the Tallinn Manual states that \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.\u201d \tIn line with its constitutional obligation to defend the Alliance, the German military also primarily has defensive cybercapabilities, meaning that it is geared for cyberdefence.132 Cyberdefence includes measures for repelling threats not just against individual per-sons or enterprises but also against the state and its social foundations. The German armed forces view themselves as the central instance for repelling exter-nal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-many\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use and the German share of cyberspace are also part of cyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not only that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out in cyberspace, but also that military deployments are occurring below the threshold of armed conflict and that non-state actors are involved. The German Federal Government therefore explicitly points out that mili-tary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nCERTS.130 Germany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the Alliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of German academics, the Centre presented proposals \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. europa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA CE2014.

Every year, NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which has also been entrusted with operative IT security and network surveillance, organises its three-day Cyber Coalition.137 The NCIRC Coordination Centre is responsible for coordinating with member states and partner organisations for this event, such as the EU, OSCE or International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

If these preconditions are met, it is legally possible to take damaging (counter-)measures against an attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gather-ing and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German armed forces can use their own capacities to protect the whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this is Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the armed forces to repel and cope with a particularly grave incident. However, each armed deployment of German military forces requires the assent of the Ger-man Parliament under a law known as the Parlaments-beteiligungsgesetz.140 In developing a German cyber-defence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early on about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal precondition of parliamentary approval that exists in Germany is a major asset that must not carelessly be sacrificed to technological progress. In this context, there needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval after the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal Constitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah deci-sion141 in the summer of 2015.

The EU states involved should focus their energies on giving EU con-cerns more emphasis in the GGE in future, as stipulated in the Council\u2019s conclusions on cyberdiplomacy.152 In this, the EU needs to speak \u201cwith one voice\u201d, because \nence in arms control and confidence-building that span opposing blocs, the German OSCE chairmanship is developing CSBMs in all three areas for cyberspace. \nThe OSCE is a regional approach that complements and supplements the work of the GGE.

The first steps have been taken towards intro-ducing international export-control mechanisms and incorporate surveillance technologies in sanctions packages. These approaches could be continued, at least on the regional level, using the EU\u2019s dual-use regulation.158 In particular, the export of such prod-ucts to countries with authoritarian regimes needs to be more strictly prohibited than before. To this end, a standardised definition of cyberweapons must be elaborated and monitoring regimes be conceived at the EU and UN levels.159 For the time being, it is un-likely that governments will conclude multilateral international-law treaties, which provide a binding \nespionage and other military purposes, such as hybrid warfare. Dual-use technology is an awkward subject in the cooperation between civilian and military actors as well as between public and private actors, especially in the transatlantic alliance. Euro-Atlantic cooperation would be a good prelude to committing states within the EU and NATO to reporting weak points in IT prod-ucts to the manufacturers, rather than deliberately building in backdoors.

As a European middle-size power, Germany will only be able to find this new focus in a perspective that is in keeping with its integration in European Union, democratic values and firm commit-ment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence norm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary institutional structures in the medium term to guar-antee that the norm is being applied effectively. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role in coordinating an international cyber policy and cyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only depart-ment that rises above the sectional perspectives of individual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial re-\nand global character of a good international cyber and sponsibility. \ncybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic foundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security policies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-gence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental idea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility for threats that emanate from their territory and must do everything in their power in cooperation with other EU states and allies to prevent damage to third parties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-tures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and bring together a great number of interested parties. In digital industrial policy cooperation between state and private actors with the aim of pooling profession-al expertise is needed to give due diligence greater weight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence of civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for improving Germany\u2019s International and European cyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly enforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal standard and is not included as a binding regulation in bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final report of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, the represented states commit to stopping attacks that emanate from their territories and also commit to not deliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-structure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-crime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a promising step that can serve as a model for bilateral agreements between other countries. Here, it will be important to work politically towards a general recog-\nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-security policy should be formulated even more strong-ly inside EU structures. Only because of the European single market is Germany able to act with the neces-sary vigour on the international stage. A promising starting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group (FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support the implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-zontally at the EU level. While the working group has so far only been set up for three years at a time, it has already become the most important hub for coordi-nating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU and USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-national norms. Where they agree, they have enough political influence to tilt the scales towards a more effective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently needed now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-tion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally attributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently use this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by shifting the blame onto third parties. In line with the TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer and a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance need to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-tion Regulation should quickly be complemented by Privacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets the legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-tion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account the legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision of October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-panies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data being stored and evaluated according to US law. How-\nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n31\n(Improving) The Implementation of Due Diligence \never, it has also set a questionable precedent of extra-territorial applicability of its legislation \u2013 despite having previously criticised the US for such practices. \nIn practice, global companies now store any data of European citizens in Europe to prevent clashing with EU law. With this decision, the EU will applys its own law on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial effects of national law contradict the principle of due diligence obligations. States such as the US and China are likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-ing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This could result in a collision course for different national legal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-tion of the global economic space and the Internet. The Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-tic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are therefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed on those states which have been attacked, on whose territory the servers are located, or over whose data cables attacks are carried out. The density of these obligations should depend on the ability of the states in questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-ities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-tive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, IT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further development and use of cyberdefence systems. How-ever, this should be coordinated at the European level, approved by politically independent or parliamentary decisions, and remain committed to an exclusively defensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct would run counter to due diligence and would also break with the tradition of military restraint in for-eign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in all issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-rity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-ment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as part of their cyberdefence, the political change of course that might be required for this would need to be debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-supposes social resilience, which can only be created through public debate. This also includes carrying out a reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-ment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. It will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-tures for parliamentary oversight. \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point.

To create and preserve the Internet as a \npublic good, concerted global action is needed on the \nbasis of a common norm, which makes states mutu-\nally responsible for their diligence in national regula-\ntory processes. This norm is implicitly incorporated in \nthe German cybersecurity strategy of 2011 as well as \nthe EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy, which provides \nfor civil, police and military-defensive approaches to \nprotecting information-technology (IT) systems and \ninfrastructure. \nIn the course of the discussion about a new German \ncybersecurity strategy to be adopted in late autumn \nof this year, a growing number of political voices have \nalso argued that political regulation and digital sover-\neignty should be strengthened and renationalised. Poli-\ntics must face up to the reality of the military becom-\ning increasingly operative in cyberspace. This will be \nreflected in the German Federal Government\u2019s new \nWhite Paper as well as in NATO\u2019s and the EU\u2019s future \ncyberdefence. In other words, it will be implemented \nin the German and European security policy as well as \nin their defence missions and military procurement. \nLiberal democracies need to be aware that the idea \nof a free and open Internet can only be realized if \nthere is consensus among a \u201ccoalition of liberal states\u201d \nnot only on how the Internet should be governend but \nwhy International and transatlantic cooperation is \nmeaningful. German and European policy should go \nahead and orientate itself on the norm of due dili-\ngence in cyberspace \u2013 and do so in an interministerial \nway \u2013 so as to enforce it internationally. Due diligence \nin cyberspace builds on the international legal stand-\nard of due diligence, which stipulates that a state \nmust do everything necessary to prevent actions ema-\nnating from within its own territory that might in-\nfringe the rights of third parties. In the Organisation \nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), \nfor instance, there is far-reaching consensus on due \ndiligence, which would be an obvious choice for the \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n5\nIssues and Recommendations \nnormative basis for a global cyber order.

The experience of the WSIS process of the past ten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of inter-\ning policies; \tgovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would \n\uf034Civilian response: prioritising the civilian com-ponent over the military component, particularly \nbe important to make the norm of due diligence bind-ing on all stakeholders: private users, access-network \nin times of peace. operators and operators of transmission networks \nand Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration \nEuropean cooperation. Due diligence demands that states behave responsibly not only towards one another, but also in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. The EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided for this. As part of implementing the EU directive on network and information security (NIS), all EU states must introduce minimum standards and reporting requirements for IT security, and operators of critical infrastructure must be involved in fighting cyber-\ncrime. To establish the digital single market, national regulations in civil law (data protection), commercial law (Internet Governance) and competition law (do-mestic market) must be worded in such a way as to ful-fil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, it will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned Global Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members largely agree that states are responsible for their own behaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation among Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as well as with the group of likeminded western states. \nEuropean and western states represented in the \nUnited Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE negotiatons to campaign for the fight against cyber-crime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The minimum conditions for global cybersecurity are ratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as well as continuous confidence- and security-building measures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \nInclusiveness. The UN summit in December 2015, which was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) follow-up process, showed that a worldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of \nauthorities ought to ensure that due diligence is prop-erly implemented. \nCivilian response. Initiatives such as a national strate-gy to protect the economy and industry against espio-nage back strengthened defensive intelligence capa-bilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense indicates that it wants to build additional defensive capabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not be advisable for the government to evolve towards an offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in open contradiction with the idea of due diligence in cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the risk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber attacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are diffi-cult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause serious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on the German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is to persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring a given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse to NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against Islamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last resorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to prop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-secu-rity technology, for developing digital forensics, and for extensive further-training measures to heighten awareness among civil servants, scientists, academics and researchers. Confidence-building measures within the OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under the leadership of the EU and the GGE must be inten-sified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving bilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solv-ing and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and remove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of this is the accord between the US and China on fight-\ndue diligence is unlikely in the short term.

Schmitt, ed., Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013); German Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicher-heitsstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4), 12. \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n7\n0BDue Diligence as a Guiding Principle \nmore, the International Court has elaborated in a decision \u201cthat the obligation of prevention is a due diligence obligation\u201d.10 Due diligence enables the in-ternational community to use international law \u201cto hold states to account for omissions in making their infrastructure safe; for breaching their obligations by neglecting to take action; or for a lack of cooperation in protecting against and solving cyber attacks\u201d.11 \tIn 2000, the UN General Assembly called on states \u201e[to] ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u201c.12 The UN Group of Governmental Ex-perts (GGE), in which Germany is represented, picked up this idea in its final report of June 2015. According to the report, all states shall ensure that their terri-tories, and especially the computersystems and infra-structure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 control, is not misused for attacks on the infrastruc-ture of other states.13 \n\tDue diligence is usually translated in international law treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-pflicht\u201d.14 However, this term only refers to restrictions on one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful to use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The principle of due diligence derives its particular norma-tive force from the idea that states are not only respon-sible for keeping law and order on their own territories, but also bear responsibility for the external consequences of \n10  International Court of Justice, \u201cCase Concerning Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Decisions taken by individual states increasingly have an impact beyond their national ter-ritory. That is why states must exercise care with such decisions and be accountable to one another for them. As far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply limit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. This study further assumes that safeguarding the Inter-net needs to the political will by all stakeholders for international cooperation.15 Accordingly, states in cooperation with other states are obliged to do every-thing that may be reasonably expected of them to help deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. \n\t\tThis expectation encompasses decision-making processes that meet high standards. This means that available competences should be integrated as far as possible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics should be avoided.16 In other words, an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due diligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode of regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated at the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated into inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.17\uf034Due diligence18 comprises regulatory processes \t\twith a high level of representativity and inclusive-\t\tness as well as transparency. As Christopher Daase \t\tpointed out: \u201cIn democracies, in the long term, no \t\tpolicy can be pushed through against the will of \t\tthe majority and not even against the resistance of \n15  The collaboration of IT emergency teams (Computer Emer-gency Response Team, CERT) in the CyberGreen project (www. \ncybergreen.net) could serve as a model. Here, CERTs from the Pacific Region states as well as Japan and China work together to ensure a \u201cgreen cyberspace\u201d.They perceive themselves as strictly technical, but the project is nevertheless based on the idea of jointly identifying and rectifying weak areas, such as malware or vulnerable networks. \n16  An example is the debate about communications encryption and the divergent positions of the security agencies on the one hand and industry representatives on the other hand. On this point, see also Berklett Cybersecurity Project, ed., Don\u2019t Panic: Making Progress on the \u201cGoing Dark\u201d Debate (Cambridge, MA: Berk-man Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, February 2016). 17  These vital requirements derive from the results of the 2015 SWP CyberLabs (see note 3). \n18  On the concept of responsibility in international relations, see the results of the conference on \u201cPolitik und Verantwortung\u201d (Frankfurt/Main, 10\u201312 February 2016), to be published in 2017 in a special issue of the Politische Vierteljahresschrift (PVS).

The openness of a political system is, in turn, a funda-mental prerequisite for states trusting one another so that they can deliver their individual contribu-tions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure cyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy to meet. In a technically challenging area such as international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, consultations often need to be confidential. Fur-thermore, the expertise of large companies almost inevitably dominates this field, making it extraor-dinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or members of parliament to be accepted as compe-tent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore required to prevent one-sided representations of interests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the \n\uf034Through its international cyber policy, Germany intends to achieve effective collaboration on cyber-security in Europe and across the world. German measures to promote a free and secure Internet should therefore always be integrated at the Euro-pean or transatlantic level. No state can seriously claim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. \nGermany will only be able to gain sufficient nego-tiating power on the global stage if it coordinates intensively with the leading European cybernations (France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such as the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber Issues (FoP Cyber).23 Only regulatory processes co-ordinated at the European level can prevent global-isation and digitalisation from aggravating the symptoms of the crisis in European integration. \nFor historical reasons, it is self-evident for Germany that the militarisation and securitisation of cyber-space24 must be counteracted. Due diligence also signi-fies that states should not merely orientate themselves along national interests, but also think in the catego-ries of global public good. Germany\u2019s tradition of \nindustry.21 civilian power25 is perpetuated in its international \nA maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign policy states that regulatory practices should be co-ordinated as closely as possible with its most impor-tant European partners.22 The internal market is so tightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 as indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that individual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are \n19  Christopher Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolg-reicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d, lecture given at the CyberLab of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP) \ncyber policy and cybersecurity policy as well. \n\uf034The German Federal Republic has always held to the principle of generally pursuing its interests through economic and political rather than mili-tary means. In view of this tradition, the only \nresponsible international cyber policy and cyber-security policy is one that tries to civilise inter-national policy in cyberspace. That would mean internationalising socially accepted norms as much as possible \u2013 for example in the GGE, OSCE and \n(Berlin, 8 September 2015). A \u201crallying-effect\u201d is a short-term but \nfar-reaching and broad public agreement with or toleration of exceptional measures, especially in times of crisis. \n20  For example, lobbying by the industry during the drafting of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) culmi-nated in entire passages of text from trade-association position papers being reproduced in the amendments to the legislative act.

Responding to cyber attacks with automatic counterattacks and digital acts of reprisal would be extremely problematic. For one thing, any attempt to attribute cyber attacks un-equivocally raises all sorts of technical, legal and political questions; for another, counterattacks can have serious side-effects. Active cyberdefence might provoke a digital arms race \u2013 for instance through Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs27) \u2013 with incalcu-lable risks for fragile critical infrastructure. From a due diligence perspective, a strategy of \u201cdeterrence-by-resilience\u201d28 is therefore preferable. With their new IT-security law and the NIS (Network and Infor-mation Security) directive, Germany and the EU are leading by example in creating resilient infor-mation and communications structures in critical infrastructure and in setting minimum standards in IT security. Research into resilience, prevention, peace and conflict has a key role to play in cyber-security when it comes to civilising politics. \n\tIn due diligence, material and procedural contents merge into an overarching norm. For the purposes of \n26  Offensive strategies aim at \u201cattacking the systems of other states, sabotaging them, gaining control over them, rendering them inoperative or causing malfunctioning\u201d. But it is a matter of \u201csecuring and sustaining one\u2019s own IT structures and com-munications and weapons systems, and protecting them against being influenced or attacked, by using so-called defensive \napproaches.\u201d German Parliament, Kleine Anfrage der Abgeordneten Dr. Alexander Neu u.a.: Krieg im \u201cCyber-Raum\u201d \u2013 offensive und defensive Cyberstrategie des Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung, Drucksache 18/6496 (Berlin, 16 October 2015).

This is about \u201cresist[ing] the securitisation of the Internet and of Internet \npolicy. The goal should not so much be security in abstracto as resilience, meaning the ability to with-stand shocks. And that can only be achieved through complex structures involving the whole of society\u201d.29 An international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy is based on a broad understanding of security and involves all stakeholders such as the state, academia, industry and society.30\n29  Daase, \u201cInnenpolitische Voraussetzungen erfolgreicher Cyber-Au\u00dfen- und Sicherheitspolitik\u201d (see note 19). \n30  The multi-stakeholder model was laid down as the foundation for Internet Governance at the World Summit on the Informa-tion Society (WSIS II) in Tunis in 2005. During the UN Summit held in December 2015 as part of the WSIS follow-up process, there was disagreement on how this model, which has been suc-cessfully used in the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), might be developed further. \nDue Diligence in Institutional Practice \nGerman policies are already beginning to take due diligence into account to some extent, but the norm is not yet sufficiently embedded in German institutions. \nFrom this perspective, the coherence and the consist-ency of content of Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy must be closely scrutinised. Its current institutional structure reflects the fact that the implementation of due diligence has already come a long way. The responsible authorities are now closely interconnected. However, it is also clear that much still needs to be improved with a view to European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response. \nInstitutional Structures \nThe German Federal Government has committed to creating a complete instrumentarium in coordination with the responsible state authorities to defend against cyber attacks.31 This is intended to contribute to guar-anteeing security provisions for the state as a whole. \nThe development of fully differentiated responsibili-ties is politically willed.32 Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy contains a whole series of cooperations, which essentially rest on five \ninfrastructure. It has an IT emergency team (CERT-Bund) at its disposal for this. The Federal Office fulfils its mission as \u201cthe central reporting office for security in Federal-Government IT\u201d, in charge of \u201crepelling harmful programmes and threats to the Federal Gov-ernment\u2019s communications technology\u201d, \u201cstipulating guidelines on security standards\u201d and providing cer-tifications.34 Because of the high quality of the BSI standard (ISO 27001) for promoting certified basic func-tions, and because of other recommendations, the BSI enjoys a high level of European and international recognition. For years, it has been involved in an in-tensive international exchange of experience and in-formation at the management and professional levels. \nAt the operations level, cooperation with other IT emergency teams is especially important. CERT-Bund belongs to the interdisciplinary International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN).35 At the domestic level, the BSI initiated the founding of the Allianz f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit (alliance for cybersecurity), which now pools German know-how on cybersecurity and has become the main point of contact for companies and citizens.36 The Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and the IT emergency team of the \npillars. German armed forces (CERTBw) work closely with \nthe BSI, in particular with its IT situation and analysis \nFirst Pillar: The Federal Office for Information Security In Germany, overall ministerial control over cyber-security issues rests with the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI).33 The Federal Office for Informa-tion Security (BSI) is the Federal Government\u2019s most important service provider in IT security. It reports to the BMI. The BSI is also responsible for operations to repel attacks against the Federal Government\u2019s IT \n31  German Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheits-\ncentre and the CERT-Bund team. \nSecond Pillar: The National Cyberdefence Centre \nA vital step towards implementing due diligence was taken in 2011 with the creation of the National Cyber-\ndefence Centre.37 This information platform is intended \n34  German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, \ned., Gesetz \u00fcber das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik \n(BSI-Gesetz \u2013 BSIG), last modified on 17 July 2015, http://www. \ngesetze-im-internet.de/bsig_2009/BJNR282110009.html (accessed \nstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). 30 November 2015). \n32  In Norway, for instance, the national cybersecurity strategy is part of the portfolio of the ministry of justice.

The Centre is also part of the state\u2019s project-based collaboration with companies and service providers, and with foreign security ser-vices. The separation rule is a fundamental tenet of German federal legislation and stipulates that the tasks of the police and the intelligence services must be carried out by different, organisationally distinct authorities. Counter-intelligence is the purview of the BfV while the BKA is responsible for policing criminally motivated IT attacks. The technical information depart-ment (TA) of the Federal Intelligence Services (BND) retrieves information by technical means (Signals In-telligence or SIGINT); it obtains, in accordance with its official mandate, information that is significant for Germany\u2019s foreign and security policy; and it evalu-ates it.38 Using this information, the BND also sup-ports the German armed forces in their cyberdefence. \nThird Pillar: The National Cybersecurity Council \nWhen dealing with the challenges of cybersecurity, strong coordination with the state as a whole must be ensured.39 To this end, the interministerial National Cybersecurity Council, chaired by the Federal Com-missioner for Information Technology, brings together the secretaries of state.40 Furthermore, in Germany, IT security is a federal issue. The Cybersecurity Council consists of two federal-state representatives, repre-\n(BBK), domestic intelligence service (BfV), German Intelligence Services (BND), Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Customs Investigation Bureau (ZKA), Federal Police (BPol) and Armed Forces.

Since 2013, the Cybersecurity Council has been meet-ing three times a year. Fundamental issues of federal IT management and security are also dealt with in the interministerial council of IT commissioners (also called the IT Council). \nFourth Pillar: An International Cyber Policy \nGermany\u2019s 2011 cybersecurity strategy stipulates \nthe development of a targeted and coordinated inter-national cyber policy that makes it possible to take preventative measures for IT security in Germany, particularly to protect critical infrastructure and for international cooperation.41 This international cyber policy includes a representation of German interests with the EU and other international organisations and bodies, and in bilateral dialogues. In 2011, the Minis-try of Foreign Affairs created its coordination staff for international cyber policy.42 This staff serves as the interface between national ministerial policies on the one hand and the effort to coordinate the internation-al exertion of influence on the other hand, with the aim of creating a climate of security and trust, such as is indispensable for a defensive cybersecurity strategy. \nFifth Pillar: The German Armed Forces \nMeasures taken by the German military should be lim-ited to protecting their own capacity to act in accord-ance with their mandate, \u201cso as to embed cybersecurity as a part of the security provisions for the state as a whole\u201d.43 This is the responsibility of the German mili-\n41  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \n42  Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Cyber-Au\u00dfenpolitik, http:// www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/GlobaleFragen/ Cyber-Aussenpolitik/KS_Cyber-Aussenpolitik_node.html (ac-cessed 5 February 2016). \n43  Federal Ministry of the Interior, ed., Cyber-Sicherheitsstrategie \n22 February 2016). f\u00fcr Deutschland (see note 4). \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n12\nInstitutional Structures \ntary\u2019s CNO forces,44 which are to be expanded further and to be used for active cyberdefence in future.45 This seems to indicate a potential paradigm change from defensive to offensive cyberprotection. In September 2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for cyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the minis-try\u201d.46 The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned for specific military cyber operations. There are also plans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) an expanded counter-intelligence mission for deploy-ment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose a risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for duty.47 Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, perma-nent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence service\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider on security issues, and it advises and supports the German armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and on foreign deployment\u201d.48 \nAt the parliamentary level, currently three main bodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity strategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intel-ligence activities: the parliamentary oversight com-mittee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA commit-tee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-\nagenda committee, interior committee, foreign com-mittee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics of the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace makes no distinction between domestic and foreign policy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy and the rule of law, must take this insight into account \n44  Computer Network Operations (CNO) are non-kinetic means of attack, which work by implementing computer codes or com-puter programmes in cyberspace. They serve to manipulate, disrupt or even destroy enemy information and communications systems as well as protect states\u2019 own systems or gather infor-mation from data sources that are not publicly available. CNOs are therefore subdivided into Computer Network Attacks (CNA), Computer Network Defence (CND) and Computer Network \nExploitation (CNE). \n45  Federal Ministry of Defence, \u201cTagesbefehl der Ministerin: Bundeswehr wird im Cyber-Raum zukunftsf\u00e4hig\u201d (Berlin, 17 Sep-tember 2015). \nboth conceptually and institutionally. Domestic policy should be adjusted in accordance with due diligence. This is the only way of restoring the citizens\u2019, allies\u2019 and EU partners\u2019 trust lost during the Edward Snow-den leaks. Trust is an indispensable prerequisite for European cooperation and politics. However, the im-plementation of the three major challenges to an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 namely Europeen cooperation, inclusiveness and civil-ian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe methods used at the federal and EU levels to establish an overview of the cyber threat situation are unsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more successful, proposals have been put forward to trans-form the National Cyberdefence Centre into an um-brella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently bring together all federal and state authorities. There are also calls for more cooperation between national and EU authorities with a view to a European ex-\nchange of information.49 Some important partners, such as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany not only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d frequently unclear, but also because they do not \nalways know with which ministry to negotiate as part of the European coordination. Moreover, vital coordi-nation at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because the attribution of specific responsibilities is so com-plicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, coalition partners have been discussing whether Ger-many needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital agency.50 However, they have only been able to agree on an office without power or resources: the office of Digital Champion of the Federal Government, cur-rently held by Gesche Joost. \n46  Ibid. 49  Since 2011, the European External Action Service has been \n47  Andre Meister, \u201cGeheime Cyber-Leitlinie: Verteidigungsminis-terium erlaubt Bundeswehr \u2018Cyberwar\u2019 und offensive digitale Angriffe\u201d, netzpolitik.org, 30 July 2015, https://netzpolitik.org/ 2015/geheime-cyber-leitlinie-verteidigungsministerium-erlaubt-bundeswehr-cyberwar-und-offensive-digitale-angriffe/ (accessed \nresponsible for the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN), which produces civilian situation analyses for EU decision-makers based on material delivered by national intelligence services.

In part, these reforms have only become public knowledge through leaked docu-ments.51 However, the BSI\u2019s much-discussed institu-tional dependency remains unchanged.52 In February 2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the \npresident of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6n-bohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views his links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. \nCritics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times the resources available for the offensive approach than there are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks or compromised IT security\u201d.53 Besides, according to a member of the executive board of the Federal Associa-tion of the Information Economy, Telecommunica-tions and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only one in five companies makes use of the IT consultan-cies offered by the government.54 Moreover, compa-nies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to contact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather than the police, since the latter would have to launch a preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act was suspected. Consultations are underway on reform-ing the intelligence services as well as improving par-liamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.55\n51  Following the leaks, Chief Federal Prosecutor Harald Range launched preliminary proceedings against the Internet portal netzpolitik.org, on suspicion of treason. However, the case was dropped after political intervention.

In \n2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hans-j\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated for regulating the exchange of information by intel-ligence services and that a post of parliamentary \nombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to be created, modelled on the parliamentary ombuds-person for the armed forces.56\nCivilian Response \nThe permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the \nFederal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised that it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT security, but that the BMI had overall control on issues of cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being questioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. Even the National Cybersecurity Council has not been able to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient distribution of resposibilities. In July 2013, while eluci-dating the NSA affair, the German Federal Govern-ment did publish an eight-point programme on im-proving protection of the private sphere.57 However, the Cybersecurity Council did not publicly take a \nposition on the questionable practices of the security services \u2013 for instance, committing industrial espio-nage58 or keeping selector lists with spying targets.59\n56  Rudi Wais, \u201cSo k\u00f6nnte eine bessere Kontrolle der Nachrich-tendienste aussehen\u201d, Augsburger Allgemeine, 3 May 2015, http:// \n2015). www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/So-koennte-eine-bessere-\n52  Despite media claims to the contrary \u2013 see e.g. \u201cBundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) soll neue Bundes-beh\u00f6rde werden\u201d, Der Spiegel, 10 August 2014 \u2013 the BSI continues to report to the BMI.

It must be remembered that, \nof Private Actors to meet due diligence requirements, the digital indus-\ntrial policy curently being developed needs the public \nDue diligence requires not only that institutional structures be constructed, it also needs sophisticated capabilities in information and communications tech-nology (ICT) and their \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d.60 Over the past few decades, automisation has allowed the German economy to respond well to the global \nand private sectors to cooperate, needs to be integrated into European harmonisation and needs to focus on a defensive cybersecurity policy. \nEuropean Cooperation \npressures to be competitive and innovative.

Their special focus is first and foremost the German industrial policy. However, Industrie 4.0, meaning the Internet of Things, can only be designed at the European or even global level.68 \tIn May 2015, the European Commission presented a strategy for the digital single market.69 It expects this market, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros to EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the Commission currently has only limited means avail-able for developing key digital technologies. The Con-necting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a \nthe legal status of its successor agreement between the EU and the US, the Privacy Shield, continues to be disputed.72 Furthermore, in late December 2015, the European Parliament, Council and Commission agreed a General Data Protection Regulation and a directive on network and information security.73 Industry repre-sentatives, however, view European harmonisation more critically. They consider the ECJ decisions and the Commission\u2019s legal initiatives to be \u201cusing politics for a digital industrial policy\u201d74 and to be protectionist. \nbillion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding Inclusiveness \nfor the EU member states. The financing programme \nHorizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for research for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020.70 Since the Juncker Commission took up its posts in November 2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed \ninto a digital single market at the EU level with the help of a comprehensive legal package. In the Com-mission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the market, as well as distributive policies should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the necessary speed is a problem, however, because the Commission first has to harmonise the legal policies of all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions published by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a European or transatlantic agreement on data-security and data protection policy.Important decisions in this context are those on the illegality of telecommunica-tions data retention, on the right to be forgotten and on the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement.71 Even \n68  German Parliament, Antrag der Fraktionen der CDU/CSU und SPD, Industrie 4.0 und Smart Services \u2013 Wirtschafts-, arbeits-, bildungs- und forschungspolitische Ma\u00dfnahmen f\u00fcr die Digitalisierung und intelligente Vernetzung von Produktions- und Wertsch\u00f6pfungsketten, Drucksache 18/6643 (Berlin, 10 November 2015), 3; Ansgar Baums, Martin \nThe importance of private actors can also be seen in the fact that they run much critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, banks, energy concerns and water-works. Additionally, private actors often have the rele-vant knowledge for gauging threat levels and devel-oping tools to defend against threats. Only banks know how often they are attacked, and without infor-mation from industrial companies about espionage, no intelligence service can take meaningful counter-measures. Every act of regulation, development of standards and formulation of policy should therefore be carried out in solidarity with the private sector, if possible through public-private partnerships (PPP).

The direc-tive is intended to make IT more secure for operators of critical infrastructure and large online service pro-viders, and will oblige affected companies to report any security and data protection events or IT attacks. \ntives regularly get the opportunity for critical ques-tioning and for being involved in consulting process-es.78 It is part of due diligence that not only the \nnational and EU decisions but also the preparatory processes for decision-taking remain inclusive and open to the concerns of civil society, small and medium enterprises, and independent scholarship. \nThese requirements are intended for all operators and Civilian Response \nproviders of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, \nwater supply, transport, finance, health and the Inter-net. The draft lists Internet exchanges, domain regis-tration sites, online marketplaces and search engines, but not social networks. Small digital companies are also excluded. According to the directive, member states will have to build national reporting systems and exchange information with each other. \u201cCompe-tent authorities\u201d such as the BSI, as well as specific Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) in addition to the already existing CERTs will be in-volved. The German Federal Government used the long negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a solution nationally with its industry, before the EU agreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed its IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced reporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and minimum standards for protecting critical infrastruc-ture earlier than the EU.76 \nHowever, close cooperation between state authori-ties and private companies working in the area of critical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It is especially questionable whether the private sector can self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to become dependent on the interests of individual pri-vate actors to the point where they are barely able to act meaningfully without them.77 This dependency becomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these companies monopolise the relevant knowledge. In such cases, the state must be careful to ensure that members of parliament and civil-society representa-\n75  UP KRITIS office, ed., UP KRITIS. \u00d6ffentlich-Private Partnerschaft zum Schutz Kritischer Infrastrukturen (Bonn, February 2014), http:// www.kritis.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/Kritis/DE/UP_KRITIS_ Fortschreibungsdokument.pdf?__blob=publicationFile (accessed \nGovernments must resist the temptation to react to the growing number of digital attacks by building a digital arms industry and offensive cyberweapons.79 The defence policy guidelines issued by the German Federal Ministry of Defence in May 2011 already con-tain the stipulation that the German armed forces must encompass a range of abilities that is as broad as possible.80 Militarily, cyberspace is categorised as a so-called operative domain, comparable to land, air, ocean or space.

Germany, the EU and NATO have so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy in these areas. This differentiates Germany from indi-vidual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on deterrence through threats of retaliation and on sur-veillance and control technologies. Disastrous deci-sions on retaliation and escalation based on misinter-pretations could potentially result from this, since technical, political and legal reasons make it almost impossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, cyberinsecurity is growing within the international community. States are users of ICTs; they have to pro-tect their citizens and data; and at the same time they have to regulate the digital sector, which is largely dominated by private companies. Creating universally secure components is considered extremely difficult, but where software is used by the state, transparency, testing and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce from this state of affairs which are the most important areas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-rights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, fighting cybercrime; and developing international norms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and in terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise from this, such as a conflictual coordination of respon-sibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in the policies which are supposed to deal with challeng-es in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence means taking to heart the three demands of European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.85\nHuman Rights and Data Protection \nCivil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of libe-ral democracies.86 However, it is also clear \u2013 at the \n85  In choosing the following topics for an international cyber and security policy, I make no claim to exhaustiveness. The examples listed only serve to illustrate the requirements named, which each policy would have to meet according to due diligence principles. 86  Ben Wagner, \u201cFreedom of Expression on the Internet: Implica-\nvery latest since the revelations made by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even western secret services carry out passive surveillance on a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly infiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organi-sations such as Freedom House with its annual study Freedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or activists for free software remind us again and again that governments and globally active IT corporations do not provide continual barrier-free Internet access across the world. These organisations claim, for \ninstance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only gives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand that Internet access should be a basic human right; at the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far from reaching a conclusion.87 \n\tIn a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights Council emphasised that human rights are valid in the same way online as they are offline.88 In November 2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in the digital age, in which, among other things, it pro-scribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic.89 In May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption of private communications to be made a standard. In early July of the same year, the UN Human Rights Council created the post of UN special rapporteur on privacy and appointed Joseph Cannataci of Malta.90\n87  Ben Wagner, \u201cK\u00f6nnt ihr mich h\u00f6ren?\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 15 September 2015. \n88  United Nations General Assembly, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet, A/HRC/20/L.13 (New York, 29 June 2012), http://www. \nohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/ Session20/A.HRC.20.L.13_en.doc (accessed 9 December 2015). \n89  United Nations General Assembly, Third Committee Approves Text Titled \u201cRight to Privacy in the Digital Age\u201d, as It Takes Action on 18 Draft Resolutions, GA/SHC/4094 (New York, 26 November 2013), http://www.un.org/press/en/2013/gashc4094.doc.htm (accessed 9 December 2015). \n90  As early as 2014, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights published a comprehensive report on privacy in the digi-tal era.

One com-mentator remarked that \u201cproof of the maturity of the law\u201d lay in in maintaining the equilibrium between civil liberties and security measures during states of emergency.91 The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rap-porteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to privacy. \nEuropean Cooperation \nThe European experience has taught us that, in the long term, integrated economic areas also need inte-grated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty gives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of free-dom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strength-ened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was legally binding on the EU and came into force at the same time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obli-gation on the EU to ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. What holds true for the single market also holds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where the transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU and USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy Shield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, which might include steps towards harmonising \ncriminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of rele-vant data and information. Intensive cooperation among law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed to fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terror-ism, such as digital financial services providers, can only be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely on information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agree-ment on data protection for law-enforcement purposes and modernised mutual legal assistance agreements (MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive cooperation.92 Fighting terrorism also requires com-\n91  Andreas Zielcke, \u201cReifepr\u00fcfung des Rechts\u201d, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, 3 December 2015. \n92  European Union, Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the Processing and Transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for the Purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, L 195/5 (Brussels, 27 July 2010); Council of the European Union, Proposal for a Direc-tive of the Council and the European Parliament on the Use of Passenger \nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n20\nprehensive cooperation between the security services (as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d93), which must, however, be subject to more stringent parliamentary controls. It is not in the interests of due diligence to have secret services exchange their insights informally and, in so doing, circumvent legal procedures, for instance those stipulated in agreements providing for mutual legal assistance.94\nInclusiveness \nThe more legally binding that regulations on human rights and data protection are, the more crucial it is to have laws implemented in an inclusive manner. That, at least, has been the experience in the EU. In Ger-many and Europe, data protection is directly linked to the right to informational self-determination whereby citizens have a say in how their personal data may be used. This right far exceeds the norm of due diligence, because the state has a duty of protection towards its citizens that it must fulfil. Technically speaking, data protection and the state\u2019s protective duties associated with it differ by area: international economic inter-\nName Record Data for the Prevention, Detection, Investigation and Pros-ecution of Terrorist Offences and Serious Crime, 14670/15 (Brussels, 2 December 2015). \n93  This is the most significant secret-services cooperation in the world, between the USA, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The new Regulation will have to be transposed directly into national law as of 2018. The GDPR reform package includes a directive that stipu-lates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data processing by the police and judicial authorities of the EU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-on of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other uses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-known examples of this practice are the large digital-service providers such as Amazon, Google and Face-book, which store the data of European clients in the US using data protection provisions that violate Euro-pean law.

Any EU member state launching a prosecution will also always access data sources that were generated in allied states under different legal circumstances and do not meet the strict German or European requirements for data protection. While increased retention of data is viewed as an important instrument in fighting cybercrime, it has been inad-missible to inform on or survey transmission data generated in the past since the German Federal Court\u2019s decision of 2 March 2010. On 8 April 2014, the ECJ also quashed the EU directive on data retention, arguing that it was incompatible with the EU Charter of Fun-damental Rights. A draft law presented by Federal Justice Minister Heiko Maas in 2015 intends to store the telecommunications data of all German citizens for 10 weeks.99 Technically, the instrument is already almost outdated. \n97  The federal commissioner for data protection and freedom of information is expected to control the data protection efforts of telecommunications and postal services providers, federal agencies and other public federal offices.

It is pointless to stand alone, for the simple reason that Germany does not have sufficient negotiating power in the multilateral or Internet Governance fora. The EU position was set in June 2011 when the European Commisssion declared that the EU\u2019s aim was to create \u201ca single, un-fragmented network, subject to the same laws and norms that apply in other areas of our day-to-day lives\u201d.111 The EU and Germany are in favour of a leading role for the \nInclusiveness and legitimacy are highly controversial in global Internet Governance.112 However, civil-\nsociety interest groups and members of parliament ought to be involved in the setting of global Internet norms, so that decisions are not only taken by \ntechnical bodies such as the Internet Architecture Board.

First and foremost, this concerns critical infrastructure and personal civil rights (and liberties).

Much work is being carried out on encryption technologies to make this task more difficult.118 Users themselves play a decisive role in civilising communications. They can exert pressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated and fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes sense for the Internet Governance committees to dis-cuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It would be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet Governance or to allow states to exert increasing \ninfluence over it, with the exception of state bodies wanting to comply with due diligence. Fundamental-ly, however, Internet Governance remains in the \nhands of private actors for the time being. \n115  Provisional email addresses are also offered under the names of disposable email or instant email.

So far, the EU has limited itself to coordinating the effort to create \u201can open, secure and protected cyberspace\u201d by focusing on a) creating resilient IT structures, b) fighting cybercrime, c) developing defen-sive cybercapacities, d) promoting industrial and tech-nological developments in cybersecurity, and e) devel-oping international cyberdiplomacy.121 The success and prospects of Europe\u2019s internal security depend on it acting at the national, European and international levels whilst making use of the technological possibil-ities of information exchange between these levels and giving that exchange legal protection.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-nal offences using intergovernmental agreements of individual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed is a process that involves all EU states and orientates itself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \nAs of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-ity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and political system still rests on criminal law applying and operating within national borders. At the same time, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access rights because cloud services, for example, operate beyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-centrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while applying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are a number of further meaningful initiatives, such as the European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-pean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual legal assistance agreements, including all relevant transatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies from relocating their business abroad and thus cir-cumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-security standards (the NIS directive) should be brought into line with those set in the US by the National Insti-tute of Standards. Transatlantic cooperation has an important role to play not only in public-private part-nerships, but also at the official level, for instance in the EU-US working group on fighting cybercrime.123\nnets.124 While it remains difficult to attribute cyber attacks unequivocally \u2013 for instance, because of falsi-fied invoices, sabotaged computer systems and pass-word theft \u2013 perpetrators nonetheless leave digital traces. Reconstruction and analysis \u2013 IT forensics \u2013 are thus the pivot of criminal prosecution.125 The German authorities, including the BKA and the state bureaux of investigation, therefore back the action plan of the European Police Office (Europol).126 Today, prosecut-ing authorities also systematically look for dangers in the IT system (threat hunting), instead of merely \nreacting to attacks. Where such a hunt is successful, attackers may be prevented from accessing the most sensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is stored in such a way that it can be used in court. \nGathering evidence from large and complex data \nbanks takes time and requires extremely powerful computers. Digital forensics face enormous challeng-es. That is why authorities bank on support from \nprivate IT forensic scientists to solve crimes. But \npublic-private cooperation on cybersecurity has its weak points, among other reasons because industry has so far not markedly got involved in fighting crime, except for the BSI initiative Allianz f\u00fcr Cyber-\nSicherheit and for CERT exchanges. The Global Player Initiative is a network founded back in 2006, in which the BKA and (currently) 62 large enterprises partici-pate. Overall, the BKA cooperates with about 630 \ncompanies. Frequently, this exchange of information is still more of a one-way street, because small and \nInclusiveness medium enterprises in particular do not have the \ncapacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \nSecurity agencies on the EU and national levels will have to get used to the fact that the fight against cybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-tion of private actors. A clear separation between private and public sector can hardly be upheld in this area, because the companies that have been attacked are frequently the only bodies that have the means of \nIn Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are obliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \nminimum security standards for their IT.

According to the strategy the relevant agencies need to be given more supranational com-petences and more funds. These include Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)128; the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA); and the European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust). The cyberexercises that are regularly co-ordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they are important for building resilient IT structures in accordance with due diligence. 29 EU-EFTA member states and 200 governmental organisations participated in the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise.129 The exercise was designed to test how to improve cooperation between states in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the whole of Europe; how the many parallel communica-tions relations impact on generating an overview of the national and European situation; and what con-sequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might have for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. At the operative level, the continuous cooperation of the IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispen-sable.

The German armed forces view themselves as the central instance for repelling exter-nal dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Ger-many\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use and the German share of cyberspace are also part of cyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not only that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out in cyberspace, but also that military deployments are occurring below the threshold of armed conflict and that non-state actors are involved. The German Federal Government therefore explicitly points out that mili-tary actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks. \nEuropean Cooperation \nCERTS.130 Germany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for Euro-\npean and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with \nthe aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due \nCyberdefence \nThe NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the Alliance, but is not part of its command structure. \nIn the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of German academics, the Centre presented proposals \n128  Europol, European Cybercrime Center (EC3), http://www.europol. europa.eu/content/megamenu/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3-1837 (accessed 5 February 2016). \n129  European Network and Information Security Agency, ENISA CE2014.

Germany is a prominent representative at all of these international debates. 20 states, including five EU member states, took part in the fourth round of the negotiations of governmental experts on information security (UN GGE).151 The final reports of the expert rounds were adopted by the UN General Assembly.

A fifth round of GGE nego-tiations is scheduled to start in 2016. The EU states involved should focus their energies on giving EU con-cerns more emphasis in the GGE in future, as stipulated in the Council\u2019s conclusions on cyberdiplomacy.152 In this, the EU needs to speak \u201cwith one voice\u201d, because \nence in arms control and confidence-building that span opposing blocs, the German OSCE chairmanship is developing CSBMs in all three areas for cyberspace. \nThe OSCE is a regional approach that complements and supplements the work of the GGE.

The first steps have been taken towards intro-ducing international export-control mechanisms and incorporate surveillance technologies in sanctions packages. These approaches could be continued, at least on the regional level, using the EU\u2019s dual-use regulation.158 In particular, the export of such prod-ucts to countries with authoritarian regimes needs to be more strictly prohibited than before. To this end, a standardised definition of cyberweapons must be elaborated and monitoring regimes be conceived at the EU and UN levels.159 For the time being, it is un-likely that governments will conclude multilateral international-law treaties, which provide a binding \nespionage and other military purposes, such as hybrid warfare. Dual-use technology is an awkward subject in the cooperation between civilian and military actors as well as between public and private actors, especially in the transatlantic alliance. Euro-Atlantic cooperation would be a good prelude to committing states within the EU and NATO to reporting weak points in IT prod-ucts to the manufacturers, rather than deliberately building in backdoors.

As a European middle-size power, Germany will only be able to find this new focus in a perspective that is in keeping with its integration in European Union, democratic values and firm commit-ment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence norm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative \nnition of due diligence and also to create the necessary institutional structures in the medium term to guar-antee that the norm is being applied effectively. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role in coordinating an international cyber policy and cyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only depart-ment that rises above the sectional perspectives of individual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial re-\nand global character of a good international cyber and sponsibility. \ncybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic foundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security policies are always also domestic policies. \nGermanys has started to implement the due dili-gence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental idea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility for threats that emanate from their territory and must do everything in their power in cooperation with other EU states and allies to prevent damage to third parties. Developments in German cybersecurity struc-tures are already taking great strides in this direction. \nThey are at least partly coordinated with the EU and bring together a great number of interested parties. In digital industrial policy cooperation between state and private actors with the aim of pooling profession-al expertise is needed to give due diligence greater weight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence of civilian over military approaches. \nNevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for improving Germany\u2019s International and European cyber policy and cyberdefence policy: \nFirst: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly enforced in international relations. For the time \nbeing, it merely has the status of a controversial legal standard and is not included as a binding regulation in bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final report of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, the represented states commit to stopping attacks that emanate from their territories and also commit to not deliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infra-structure or IT emergency teams. The agreement \nbetween the US and China on jointly fighting cyber-crime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a promising step that can serve as a model for bilateral agreements between other countries. Here, it will be important to work politically towards a general recog-\nGermany\u2019s international cyber policy and cyber-security policy should be formulated even more strong-ly inside EU structures. Only because of the European single market is Germany able to act with the neces-sary vigour on the international stage. A promising starting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group (FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support the implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. \nIn FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated hori-zontally at the EU level. While the working group has so far only been set up for three years at a time, it has already become the most important hub for coordi-nating national interests in EU cyber policy. \nSecond: Only a close cooperation between the EU and USA is the adequate framework for drafting inter-national norms. Where they agree, they have enough political influence to tilt the scales towards a more effective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently needed now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribu-tion problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally attributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently use this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by shifting the blame onto third parties. In line with the TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer and a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance need to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protec-tion Regulation should quickly be complemented by Privacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets the legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementa-tion of the the Privacy Shield should take into account the legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision of October 2015. This is the only basis for giving com-panies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. \nWith its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data being stored and evaluated according to US law. How-\nSWP Berlin \nDue Diligence in Cyberspace \nMay 2016 \n31\n(Improving) The Implementation of Due Diligence \never, it has also set a questionable precedent of extra-territorial applicability of its legislation \u2013 despite having previously criticised the US for such practices. \nIn practice, global companies now store any data of European citizens in Europe to prevent clashing with EU law. With this decision, the EU will applys its own law on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial effects of national law contradict the principle of due diligence obligations. States such as the US and China are likely to have fewer scruples in future about pass-ing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This could result in a collision course for different national legal systems, which would encourage the fragmenta-tion of the global economic space and the Internet. The Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlan-tic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are therefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process. \nThird: Due diligence obligations should be imposed on those states which have been attacked, on whose territory the servers are located, or over whose data cables attacks are carried out. The density of these obligations should depend on the ability of the states in questions to exert influence and on their ICT capac-ities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substan-tive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, IT forensics in particular should be expanded so that \nthat manufacturers should be included in the further development and use of cyberdefence systems. How-ever, this should be coordinated at the European level, approved by politically independent or parliamentary decisions, and remain committed to an exclusively defensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct would run counter to due diligence and would also break with the tradition of military restraint in for-eign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in all issues of international cyber policy and cybersecu-rity policy also means that the German Federal Parlia-ment must be duly involved. Should the German \narmed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as part of their cyberdefence, the political change of course that might be required for this would need to be debated in Parliament. A robust security policy pre-supposes social resilience, which can only be created through public debate. This also includes carrying out a reality check on the parliamentary-approval require-ment for cyber operations by the German armed forces. It will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective struc-tures for parliamentary oversight. \nperpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. \nNon-state actors should be called on to participate \nactively. Where companies are forced to break the law \nbecause of differences in national legal standards (for \ninstance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for infor-\nmation that must be complied with, and on the other \nhand, a prohibition on handing out data for data \nprotection reasons), the states involved do not live up \nto the principle of the rule of law. Given the experi-\nence of European integration, it would be advisable \nto confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction \nalong the lines of the European Court of Justice or \ncourts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence \nbetter on this point. This would also reduce legal un-\ncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must \nbe possible to force companies to make their software \nproducts more secure. At the very least, the criteria for \ntransparency, testing and certification must be made \nmore stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA. \nFourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected \nweapons systems and the high quality that detected \ncyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity \nknow-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to \ntake data security into account at the design stage of \nany system architecture.

Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace and confl ict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d 4 Among these customary and \u201clong stand-ing international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, this principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal acts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or control. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as it was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space was fi nite and obvious. How can this old wine fi t into the new bottles of ubiquitous and dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of an armed attack?\nI will fi rstly briefl y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law (2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns the applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-evance in this fi eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to  c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber a series of specifi diligence\u201d obligation and the need to fi nd a right balance between the obligation to protect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to respect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having this in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation to enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against others States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber infrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react in relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-ply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and duties of States, to more specifi c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in international environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in international human rights law.\n2. \tDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. According to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the terri-\nOpenness in a Networked World (Washington 2011), p. 9.\n24\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\ntory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war.5\nThis duty of due diligence has since then been reaffi rmed and developed in many cases. Among them, the most famous one is undoubtedly the Corfu Channel case in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) famously said that \u201cevery State [has the] obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.6 \n\tToday, everybody agrees that the dictum of the Court expresses a general prin-ciple of international law. It is also accepted that the duty of diligence goes beyond the territory of States and covers \u201call activities which take place under the jurisdic-tion or control\u201d of States7 whereas these activities are conducted by the State itself or by others entities private as public.8\n\ttral Awards, United Nations, Vol. II, p. 839.

It refers to situations where the infrastructure is located outside the respective State\u2019s territory, but that State nevertheless exercises exclusive control over it.

Due diligence is an obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result.10 According to S. Heathcote, this means that States should \u201cdeploy their best efforts to achieve [the] desired outcome ... even if that outcome need not be ensured\u201d.11 However, the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d12 could give the impression that we are in the borderline between a normative and a merely political obligation.13 It could thus be better to declare that States have the obligation to \u201cemploy all available means\u201d or \u201cto take all available measures\u201d, or to \u201cdo all that could be reasonably expected of them\u201d.14 \n\tAs the ICJ said in 2007 in the Genocide case:\nharmful to others States, but also, for example, to activities that infl ict serious damage, or have the potential to infl ict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the ter-ritorial sovereignty of the target State\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 26 para. 3.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-cal importance.15\n3. \tFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-ties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect other States.\u201d16 \n\tThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from the territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the hesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this respect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-ritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-ary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \tSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-ties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-side the context of armed confl ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet and cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-tion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-space, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may create effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities in cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to M. N. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u201cthe principle of sovereignty protects cyber infrastructure on a State\u2019s territory irrespective of whether it is government owned or private\u201d, in M. \nN. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u2018The International Law of Attribution During Proxy \u201cWars\u201d in Cyberspace\u2019,1 Fletcher Security Review (2014) p. 4.\n17 \tThe Tallinn Manual underlines that no consensus among experts of the Tallinn Manual \twas reached \u201cwhether this rule applies to State through which cyber operations are \trouted.\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 12. \n27\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\nin principle to illegal cyber-attacks. This being said, we should not underestimate the extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy cyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-edge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, the available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the ICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to notify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed in relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-able for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is launched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter had or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-come could be different. \n4. \tKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the fi rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the ICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) were fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at their disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these obligations\u201d.19 \n\tStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening on their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20 \n\tIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous Osman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the diffi culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.21\n\tin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suffi cient time \tbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\tish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \treported and the moment of the fi rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22. 19 \tICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \tv.

Due to the fact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof could become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach of international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate the existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel judgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact and circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \n\tIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of events was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-dom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \tThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of diligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber acts in question25 one should ask whether itshould also be applicable in cases of constructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a specifi c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-ing that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether this rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) knowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26\nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \tIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \tin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \tregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \tleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \tused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \tproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \tAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\tsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \tat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \timmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\tnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \tinvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \tcase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \tSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \thas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10. 26 \tIbid.,p. 28, para. 11.\n29\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tHere again the case law of the ICJ seems useful. In CorfuChannel the Court said that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \n\tThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-trol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea of constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the fi eld of Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidentifi ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-ably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \tKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in a position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take place on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as it will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to prevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \n\tIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-toring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party\u201d.29 \n\tThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-nerstone in the fi ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of States.30\nEdwards v. United Kingdom, Judgment of 14 March 2002, 2 Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 2002, para. 55.\n29 \tPulp Mills, supra note 7, para. 197.\n30 \tAccording to the French White Paper on Defence and National Security, \u201c[t]he new \timportance of cyber-threats calls for developing our intelligence activity and the cor-\tresponding technical expertise in this area. This effort should allow us to identify the \torigin of attacks, assess the offensive capabilities of potential adversaries and in this \tway counter their action. Identifi cation and offensive action capabilities are essential \n30\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\n\tBut what a slippery slope! Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in order to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-spondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated debate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 It should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise acts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit is clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international law\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise that the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice\u201d.33 \n\tIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-mise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age,adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution invites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of all their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-edge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act occurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White Paper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and offi -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35\nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case found that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to fulfi l its due diligence obligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the attack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the Territory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, the exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \tA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take?

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to life for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite numerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted in minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an impractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \n\tOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-cerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the State\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against the action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation of Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to take reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the scene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct attacks\u201d.41\ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-lation of Article 8 because there was suffi ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 enjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the State \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, European Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, ECHR A303-C, para. 51. The Human Rights Committee also clearly recognises that [t]he legal obligation under article 2, paragraph 1 [of the ICCPR], is both negative and positive in nature. \u2026 There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant rights as required by article 2 would give rise to violations by States parties of those rights, as a result of States parties\u2019 permitting or failing to take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, paras. 6, 8.\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Kili\u00e7 v.

The criterion of \u201creason-ableness\u201d was clearly affi rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-eral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. United Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite the murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-sonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of negligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest any specifi c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can isolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of reasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-ing the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, for instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the United Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found that there was \u201cnegligence\u201d 44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \tAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-tive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip from the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In the fi eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d 45 proclaimed by human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by human rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \t\tWe maybe fi nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of positive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-gence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-tive, judicial and administrative measures in the fi eld of human rights derives directly from the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-tion exist in the fi eld of cyber diligence without a specifi c treaty?\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will require almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already expressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this fi eld.48 But since due diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-sures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-intensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning cyber diligence, in order to impose specifi c and detailed obligations on States the adoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best examples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council of Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-vides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-tion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only a multilateral instrument can introduce such specifi c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to enact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others States, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case,  ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due States cannot claim the insuffi\npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, Vol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless Covenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties are required on ratifi cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-cies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-antees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \tSeefor example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \t30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \tCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \tSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \tSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \tmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \t2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \tsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \t(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\n35\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\ndiligence.51 This means that in any situation a State cannot escape its obligation by invoking the failure of its legislative apparatus.\n6. \tAn Obligation to Protect Cyber Infrastructure?\nRelated to the question of adoption of an adequate legislation stands the question of whether a State has an obligation to protect its cyber infrastructure against any interference or misuse. \n\tAccording to the US International Strategy for Cyberspace, cybersecurity due diligence implies that \u201cStates should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse\u201d.52 In the same vein the French Livre Blanc sur la D\u00e9fense focused on the need of securing vital infrastructure.53 \n\tIn March 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted also a very interesting reso-lution entitled \u201cCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity and taking stock of national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures\u201d.54Annexed to this Resolution the UN General Assembly adopted a \u201cVoluntary self-assessment tool for national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures calls States to deter-mine and assess the protection of their vital infrastructure\u201d.\n\tBut whatever the interest of these incentives, the question is to know whether due diligence includes an obligation for States to protect their own cyber infrastruc-tures. The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-ate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its own cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this infrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the ICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from omission\u201d.55 \n\tBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to protect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n131.\n52 \tThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \tLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-ness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \n\tHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect cyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 Indeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of due diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on State Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59 \n\tThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction which, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \tAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation to notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify has been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60\nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this fi eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an obligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want to secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly benefi t in helping developing countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution 64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the digital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications technologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-fer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, A/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \tSee supra section 5.1.\nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have 58 \nnever affi rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent the occurrence of a possible event suffi ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence of such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. See in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \tInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ttionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \tAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\tfi cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \t\t\t cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-diffi \n\tnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \tto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \tzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\n37\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tBut the obligation to react is not just an obligation to notify. As the Tallinn Manual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where the cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto terminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not controversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could raise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different tools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties countries and civilians. There is in this fi\n eld an obligation for States to assess the necessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \n\tOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary in order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of due diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-ation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take once again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law and especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the Cyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are among these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \n\tMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such acts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an indication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, after the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-ritorial sovereign\u201d.64 \n\tThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this fi eld. Due diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be diffi cult to investigate acts that violate individual \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \tThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \tAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\tedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \tits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \tGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \t22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \tthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \tChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \n38\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\nrights. The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, thereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65\nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d 66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention on Cybercrime could be a reference in this fi eld. \n8. \tConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-edge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. Its nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-ness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The diffi culty to apprehend activities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \n\tThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \t\t\t ght against States that could be a useful starting point in order to organise the fi \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for cyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does not authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other States, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech and the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the ubiquity of cyber operations makes it diffi cult for States to implement the principle alone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably be necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community and to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the future of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between these competitive interests.\nof 29 July 1988, Cn\u00b0 4, paras. 176\u2013177.

For many observers, there is no need to develop new norms. Accord-ing for example to the White House International Strategy for Cyberspace \u201c[t]he \npean Studies, University of Grenoble-Alps.\n1 \tThis increase is well illustrated for example by the annual Internet Security Threat \tReport. The 2013 Report highlights that \u201c[i]f 2011 was the year of the breach, then 2013 \tcan best be described as the Year of the Mega Breach\u201d with over 552 million identities \tbreached.

Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace and confl ict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d 4 Among these customary and \u201clong stand-ing international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, this principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal acts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or control. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as it was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space was fi nite and obvious. How can this old wine fi t into the new bottles of ubiquitous and dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of an armed attack?\nI will fi rstly briefl y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law (2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns the applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-evance in this fi eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to  c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber a series of specifi diligence\u201d obligation and the need to fi nd a right balance between the obligation to protect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to respect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having this in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation to enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against others States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber infrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react in relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-ply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and duties of States, to more specifi c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in international environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in international human rights law.\n2. \tDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. According to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the terri-\nOpenness in a Networked World (Washington 2011), p. 9.\n24\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\ntory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war.5\nThis duty of due diligence has since then been reaffi rmed and developed in many cases. Among them, the most famous one is undoubtedly the Corfu Channel case in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) famously said that \u201cevery State [has the] obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.6 \n\tToday, everybody agrees that the dictum of the Court expresses a general prin-ciple of international law. It is also accepted that the duty of diligence goes beyond the territory of States and covers \u201call activities which take place under the jurisdic-tion or control\u201d of States7 whereas these activities are conducted by the State itself or by others entities private as public.8\n\ttral Awards, United Nations, Vol. II, p. 839.

It refers to situations where the infrastructure is located outside the respective State\u2019s territory, but that State nevertheless exercises exclusive control over it.

Due diligence is an obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result.10 According to S. Heathcote, this means that States should \u201cdeploy their best efforts to achieve [the] desired outcome ... even if that outcome need not be ensured\u201d.11 However, the term \u201cbest efforts\u201d12 could give the impression that we are in the borderline between a normative and a merely political obligation.13 It could thus be better to declare that States have the obligation to \u201cemploy all available means\u201d or \u201cto take all available measures\u201d, or to \u201cdo all that could be reasonably expected of them\u201d.14 \n\tAs the ICJ said in 2007 in the Genocide case:\nharmful to others States, but also, for example, to activities that infl ict serious damage, or have the potential to infl ict such damage, on persons and objects protected by the ter-ritorial sovereignty of the target State\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 26 para. 3.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-cal importance.15\n3. \tFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-ties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect other States.\u201d16 \n\tThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from the territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the hesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this respect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-ritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-ary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \tSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-ties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-side the context of armed confl ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet and cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-tion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-space, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may create effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities in cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to M. N. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u201cthe principle of sovereignty protects cyber infrastructure on a State\u2019s territory irrespective of whether it is government owned or private\u201d, in M. \nN. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u2018The International Law of Attribution During Proxy \u201cWars\u201d in Cyberspace\u2019,1 Fletcher Security Review (2014) p. 4.\n17 \tThe Tallinn Manual underlines that no consensus among experts of the Tallinn Manual \twas reached \u201cwhether this rule applies to State through which cyber operations are \trouted.\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 12. \n27\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\nin principle to illegal cyber-attacks. This being said, we should not underestimate the extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy cyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-edge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, the available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the ICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to notify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed in relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-able for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is launched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter had or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-come could be different. \n4. \tKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the fi rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the ICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) were fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at their disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these obligations\u201d.19 \n\tStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening on their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20 \n\tIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous Osman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the diffi culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.21\n\tin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suffi cient time \tbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\tish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \treported and the moment of the fi rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22. 19 \tICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \tv.

Due to the fact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof could become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach of international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate the existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel judgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact and circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \n\tIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of events was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-dom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \tThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of diligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber acts in question25 one should ask whether itshould also be applicable in cases of constructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a specifi c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-ing that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether this rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) knowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26\nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \tIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \tin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \tregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \tleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \tused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \tproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \tAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\tsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \tat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \timmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\tnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \tinvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \tcase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \tSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \thas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10. 26 \tIbid.,p. 28, para. 11.\n29\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tHere again the case law of the ICJ seems useful. In CorfuChannel the Court said that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \n\tThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-trol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea of constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the fi eld of Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidentifi ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-ably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \tKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in a position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take place on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as it will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to prevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \n\tIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-toring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party\u201d.29 \n\tThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-nerstone in the fi ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of States.30\nEdwards v. United Kingdom, Judgment of 14 March 2002, 2 Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 2002, para. 55.\n29 \tPulp Mills, supra note 7, para. 197.\n30 \tAccording to the French White Paper on Defence and National Security, \u201c[t]he new \timportance of cyber-threats calls for developing our intelligence activity and the cor-\tresponding technical expertise in this area. This effort should allow us to identify the \torigin of attacks, assess the offensive capabilities of potential adversaries and in this \tway counter their action. Identifi cation and offensive action capabilities are essential \n30\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\n\tBut what a slippery slope! Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in order to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-spondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated debate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 It should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise acts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit is clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international law\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise that the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice\u201d.33 \n\tIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-mise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age,adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution invites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of all their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-edge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act occurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White Paper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and offi -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35\nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case found that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to fulfi l its due diligence obligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the attack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the Territory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, the exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \tA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take?

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to life for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite numerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted in minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an impractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \n\tOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-cerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the State\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against the action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation of Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to take reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the scene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct attacks\u201d.41\ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-lation of Article 8 because there was suffi ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 enjoyment on their home and private life.

Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, ECHR A303-C, para. 51. The Human Rights Committee also clearly recognises that [t]he legal obligation under article 2, paragraph 1 [of the ICCPR], is both negative and positive in nature. \u2026 There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant rights as required by article 2 would give rise to violations by States parties of those rights, as a result of States parties\u2019 permitting or failing to take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, paras. 6, 8.\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Kili\u00e7 v.

The criterion of \u201creason-ableness\u201d was clearly affi rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-eral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. United Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite the murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-sonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of negligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest any specifi c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can isolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of reasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-ing the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, for instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the United Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found that there was \u201cnegligence\u201d 44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \tAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-tive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip from the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In the fi eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d 45 proclaimed by human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by human rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \t\tWe maybe fi nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of positive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-gence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-tive, judicial and administrative measures in the fi eld of human rights derives directly from the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-tion exist in the fi eld of cyber diligence without a specifi c treaty?\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will require almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already expressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this fi eld.48 But since due diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-sures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-intensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning cyber diligence, in order to impose specifi c and detailed obligations on States the adoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best examples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council of Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-vides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-tion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only a multilateral instrument can introduce such specifi c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to enact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others States, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case,  ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due States cannot claim the insuffi\npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, Vol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless Covenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties are required on ratifi cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-cies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-antees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \tSeefor example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \t30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \tCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \tSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \tSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \tmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \t2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \tsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \t(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\n35\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\ndiligence.51 This means that in any situation a State cannot escape its obligation by invoking the failure of its legislative apparatus.\n6. \tAn Obligation to Protect Cyber Infrastructure?\nRelated to the question of adoption of an adequate legislation stands the question of whether a State has an obligation to protect its cyber infrastructure against any interference or misuse. \n\tAccording to the US International Strategy for Cyberspace, cybersecurity due diligence implies that \u201cStates should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse\u201d.52 In the same vein the French Livre Blanc sur la D\u00e9fense focused on the need of securing vital infrastructure.53 \n\tIn March 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted also a very interesting reso-lution entitled \u201cCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity and taking stock of national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures\u201d.54Annexed to this Resolution the UN General Assembly adopted a \u201cVoluntary self-assessment tool for national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures calls States to deter-mine and assess the protection of their vital infrastructure\u201d.\n\tBut whatever the interest of these incentives, the question is to know whether due diligence includes an obligation for States to protect their own cyber infrastruc-tures. The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-ate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its own cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this infrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the ICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from omission\u201d.55 \n\tBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to protect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n131.\n52 \tThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \tLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-ness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \n\tHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect cyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 Indeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of due diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on State Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59 \n\tThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction which, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \tAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation to notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify has been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60\nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this fi eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an obligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want to secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly benefi t in helping developing countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution 64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the digital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications technologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-fer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, A/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \tSee supra section 5.1.\nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have 58 \nnever affi rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent the occurrence of a possible event suffi ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence of such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. See in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \tInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ttionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \tAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\tfi cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \t\t\t cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-diffi \n\tnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \tto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \tzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\n37\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tBut the obligation to react is not just an obligation to notify. As the Tallinn Manual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where the cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto terminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not controversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could raise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different tools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties countries and civilians. There is in this fi\n eld an obligation for States to assess the necessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \n\tOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary in order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of due diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-ation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take once again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law and especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the Cyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are among these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \n\tMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such acts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an indication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, after the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-ritorial sovereign\u201d.64 \n\tThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this fi eld. Due diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be diffi cult to investigate acts that violate individual \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \tThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \tAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\tedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \tits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \tGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \t22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \tthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \tChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \n38\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\nrights. The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, thereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65\nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d 66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention on Cybercrime could be a reference in this fi eld. \n8. \tConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-edge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. Its nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-ness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The diffi culty to apprehend activities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \n\tThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \t\t\t ght against States that could be a useful starting point in order to organise the fi \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for cyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does not authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other States, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech and the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the ubiquity of cyber operations makes it diffi cult for States to implement the principle alone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably be necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community and to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the future of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between these competitive interests.\nof 29 July 1988, Cn\u00b0 4, paras. 176\u2013177.

For many observers, there is no need to develop new norms. Accord-ing for example to the White House International Strategy for Cyberspace \u201c[t]he \npean Studies, University of Grenoble-Alps.\n1 \tThis increase is well illustrated for example by the annual Internet Security Threat \tReport.

Long-standing international norms guiding state behaviour \u2013 in time of peace and confl ict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace.\u201d 4 Among these customary and \u201clong stand-ing international norms\u201d, the principle of due diligence holds a special place. Indeed, this principle obliges States to protect foreign States and their citizens against illegal acts committed by non-state actors on their territories or under their jurisdiction or control. \nThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the relevance of this old principle \u2013 as it was conceived long before the invention of the \u201ccyber sphere\u201d, at a time when space was fi nite and obvious. How can this old wine fi t into the new bottles of ubiquitous and dematerialised low-intensity cyber operations that do not quite reach the level of an armed attack?\nI will fi rstly briefl y outline the meaning of due diligence in international law (2). I will then introduce what I call the \u201ccyber diligence\u201d concept, which concerns the applicability of the due diligence principle in cyberspace (3) and discuss the rel-evance in this fi eld of the fundamental element of knowledge (4). I will then turn to  c and tough questions concerning the parameters of this \u201ccyber a series of specifi diligence\u201d obligation and the need to fi nd a right balance between the obligation to protect States and citizens against damaging cyber operations and the obligation to respect other international rules such as, for example, the right to privacy (5). Having this in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation to enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against others States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber infrastructure (6). I will conclude with a discussion on the content of the duty to react in relation to cyber acts which are conducted against another State (7).\nIn order to inform the concept of \u201ccyber diligence\u201d, I will use the whole pano-ply of international Law, from general international law concerning the rights and duties of States, to more specifi c branches, such as the obligation of prevention in international environmental law or the theory of \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of states in international human rights law.\n2. \tDue Diligence as a Principle of General International Law\nThe principle of due diligence is derived from the principle of sovereignty of States. According to Max Huber in the Island of Palmas arbitration:\nTerritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a \nState. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the terri-\nOpenness in a Networked World (Washington 2011), p. 9.\n24\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\ntory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war.5\nThis duty of due diligence has since then been reaffi rmed and developed in many cases. Among them, the most famous one is undoubtedly the Corfu Channel case in which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) famously said that \u201cevery State [has the] obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.6 \n\tToday, everybody agrees that the dictum of the Court expresses a general prin-ciple of international law. It is also accepted that the duty of diligence goes beyond the territory of States and covers \u201call activities which take place under the jurisdic-tion or control\u201d of States7 whereas these activities are conducted by the State itself or by others entities private as public.8\n\ttral Awards, United Nations, Vol. II, p. 839.

It refers to situations where the infrastructure is located outside the respective State\u2019s territory, but that State nevertheless exercises exclusive control over it.

Due diligence is an obligation of conduct, not an obligation of result.10 According to S.

A State does not incur responsibility simply because \nthe desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State \nmanifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its \npower, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide. In this area \nthe notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of criti-cal importance.15\n3. \tFrom Due Diligence to \u201cCyber Diligence\u201d\nAs a general principle of international law the duty of diligence applies to all activi-ties including of course cyber activities. According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect other States.\u201d16 \n\tThis duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from the territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the hesitation of some experts,17 there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this respect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its ter-ritory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists. The same applies \nGenocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment of 26 Febru-ary 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, para. 430.\n16 \tSchmitt, supra note 7, Rule 5: \u201cControl of cyber infrastructure\u201d, p. 26. See also H. H. \nKoh (Legal Advisor of the US Department of State) for which \u201cStates conducting activi-ties in cyberspace must take into account the sovereignty of other States, including out-side the context of armed confl ict. The physical infrastructure that supports the internet and cyber activities is generally located in sovereign territory and subject to the jurisdic-tion of the territorial State. Because of the interconnected, interoperable nature of cyber-space, operations targeting networked information infrastructures in one country may create effects in another country. Whenever a State contemplates conducting activities in cyberspace, the sovereignty of other States needs to be considered\u201d, USCYBERCOM Inter-Agency Legal Conference Ft. Meade, MD, 18 September, 2012. According also to M. N. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u201cthe principle of sovereignty protects cyber infrastructure on a State\u2019s territory irrespective of whether it is government owned or private\u201d, in M. \nN. Schmitt and L. Vihul, \u2018The International Law of Attribution During Proxy \u201cWars\u201d in Cyberspace\u2019,1 Fletcher Security Review (2014) p. 4.\n17 \tThe Tallinn Manual underlines that no consensus among experts of the Tallinn Manual \twas reached \u201cwhether this rule applies to State through which cyber operations are \trouted.\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 12. \n27\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\nin principle to illegal cyber-attacks. This being said, we should not underestimate the extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy cyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowl-edge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, the available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the ICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to notify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed in relation to its due diligence obligation.18 With regard to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held account-able for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is launched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter had or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the out-come could be different. \n4. \tKnowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle\nKnowledge is the fi rst decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the ICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) were fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at their disposa1 to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these obligations\u201d.19 \n\tStates cannot nonetheless have an absolute knowledge of all things happening on their territory. This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening.20 \n\tIn a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous Osman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: \n[f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the diffi culties involved in policing modern \nsocieties, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which \nmust be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be \ninterpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.21\n\tin her waters depends on her having obtained knowledge of that fact in suffi cient time \tbefore October 22; and the duty of the Albanian coastal authorities to warn the Brit-\tish ships depends on the time that elapsed between the moment that these ships were \treported and the moment of the fi rst explosion\u201d, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 22. 19 \tICJ, United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Teheran (United States of America \tv.

Due to the fact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof could become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach of international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate the existence of knowledge.22 In order to avoid this the ICJ said in the Corfu Channel judgment that it should \u201cbe allowed a more liberal recourse to interferences of fact and circumstantial evidence \u2026 The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.\u201d23 \n\tIn that case the ICJ found that one of the indications of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of events was the fact that Albania, after the reported events affecting the United King-dom, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation.24\n4.2. \tThe Dilemma between Knowledge and Constructive Knowledge\nThis second problem is even trickier. Although it is uncontroversial that the duty of diligence applies automatically in cases where States have actual knowledge of cyber acts in question25 one should ask whether itshould also be applicable in cases of constructive knowledge, when States ought to have known about a specifi c situation.\nThe Tallinn Manual has hesitated handing down a conclusion on this point stat-ing that the International Group of Experts \u201ccould not achieve consensus as whether this rule applies if the respective State has only constructive (\u2018should have known\u2019) knowledge ... if it fails to use due care\u201d.26\nwithin its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility\u201d, in Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, p. 18.\n23 \tIbid. (emphasis added). The Court adds also that \u201c[t]his indirect evidence is admitted \tin all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions. It must be \tregarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and \tleading logically to a single conclusion\u201d, ibid. On the question of the standard of proof \tused by the ICJ see K. Del Mar, \u2018The International Court of Justice and standards of \tproof\u2019, in Bannelier, Christakis and Heathcote, supra note 11, pp. 98\u2013123.\n24 \tAs the ICJ stated, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowledge con-\tsists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in its waters, \tat the moment when it must have known this ... further, whereas the Greek Government \timmediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October 22, the Alba-\tnian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to the judicial \tinvestigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, in Corfu Channel \tcase, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320 (emphasis added).\n25 \tSee for example the Tallinn Manual according to which, \u201c[t]he Rule applies if the State \thas actual knowledge of the acts in question\u201d, in Schmitt, supra note 7, p. 28, para. 10. 26 \tIbid.,p. 28, para. 11.\n29\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tHere again the case law of the ICJ seems useful. In CorfuChannel the Court said that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d27 \n\tThis conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive con-trol exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea of constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the fi eld of Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom:\n[W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obli-\ngation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have \nknown at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an \nidentifi ed individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that \nthey failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reason-ably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.28\n4.3. \tKnowledge and Monitoring\nThis brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in a position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take place on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as it will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to prevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. \n\tIn the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the moni-toring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party\u201d.29 \n\tThe recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cor-nerstone in the fi ght against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of States.30\nEdwards v. United Kingdom, Judgment of 14 March 2002, 2 Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 2002, para. 55.\n29 \tPulp Mills, supra note 7, para. 197.\n30 \tAccording to the French White Paper on Defence and National Security, \u201c[t]he new \timportance of cyber-threats calls for developing our intelligence activity and the cor-\tresponding technical expertise in this area. This effort should allow us to identify the \torigin of attacks, assess the offensive capabilities of potential adversaries and in this \tway counter their action. Identifi cation and offensive action capabilities are essential \n30\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\n\tBut what a slippery slope! Could due diligence become a kind of Trojan horse in order to erode civil liberties starting with the right to privacy and the respect of corre-spondence? Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated debate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature.31 It should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise acts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit is clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international law\u201d.32 The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise that the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice\u201d.33 \n\tIt is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legiti-mise violations of international human rights or other rules. The resolution The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age,adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2013, is a good example of what States should respect in this domain. This resolution invites States: \n(a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital \ncommunication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and \nto create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that rele-\nvant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human \nrights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the \nsurveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal \ndata, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to \nupholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of all their obligations under international human rights law.34\nThis question of monitoring is directly linked not only to the requirement of \u201cknowl-edge\u201d, but also to the more general question of the duty for States to prevent an act occurring which is contrary to the rights of others States. \nto implementing a possible and appropriate response to such attacks\u201d, French White Paper: Defence and National Security, 2013, p. 71.

In the Alabama case, the Tribunal found that:\nthe British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral \nobligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and offi -\ncial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the United States during the \nconstruction of the said number \u2018290\u2019, to take in due time any effective measures \nof prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable.35\nIn the same way the United States-Mexico Claims Commissions in the Youmans case found that State must satisfy its duty of prevention in order to fulfi l its due diligence obligation and that Mexico failed its due diligence obligation by not preventing the attack resulting in the death of American citizens.36 It is thus not surprising that in the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ concluded that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania.\u201d37 And about 60 years later in the Armed Activities on the Territory of The Congo, the ICJ held Uganda responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance in preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.38 Thus if the existence of a duty of prevention is in no way doubted, the exact content of this duty needs to be discussed.\n5.1. \tA Duty of Prevention based on the Criterion of Reasonableness \nWhat kind of measures of prevention do States need to take? The international pro-tection of human rights gives us some very interesting insights in this fi eld, especially with the development of the so-called \u201cpositive obligations\u201d.

In the case Kili\u00e7 v. Turkey for example, the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights held Turkey responsible for the violation of the right to life for the resulting murder of a journalist that the authorities failed to protect despite numerous death threats. The Court said that the authorities failed to act even though \u201c[a] wide range of preventive measures were available which would have assisted in minimizing the risk to Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s life and which would not have involved an impractical diversion of resources\u201d.40 \n\tOn the contrary, in the \u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben v. Austria judgment of 1991, con-cerning the complaint of a non-governmental organisation to the Court about the State\u2019s failure to protect demonstrators (during a protest against abortion) against the action of counter-demonstrators, the ECtHR found that there was no violation of Article 13 since it \u201cclearly appears that the Austrian authorities did not fail to take reasonable and appropriate measures\u201d as \u201ca hundred policemen were sent to the scene to separate the participants from their opponents and avert the danger of direct attacks\u201d.41\ntime that a failure by the State to control industrial pollution by private actors was a vio-lation of Article 8 because there was suffi ciently serious interference with the applicants\u2019 enjoyment on their home and private life. The Court spoke about \u201ca positive duty on the State \u2013 to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant\u2019s rights\u201d, European Court of Human Rights, Lopez Ostra v. Spain, Judgment of 9 December 1994, ECHR A303-C, para. 51. The Human Rights Committee also clearly recognises that [t]he legal obligation under article 2, paragraph 1 [of the ICCPR], is both negative and positive in nature. \u2026 There may be circumstances in which a failure to ensure Covenant rights as required by article 2 would give rise to violations by States parties of those rights, as a result of States parties\u2019 permitting or failing to take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, paras. 6, 8.\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Kili\u00e7 v.

The criterion of \u201creason-ableness\u201d was clearly affi rmed by the ICJ in the Genocide case,42 but also in sev-eral arbitrations concerning the protection of aliens. In the case A. H. Francis v. United Mexican States, the British-Mexican Claim Commission found that despite the murder of a British citizen, the Mexican State had not failed in adopting \u201crea-sonable measures\u201d of prevention because \u201c[t]here is no direct evidence whatever of negligence on the part of the authorities, and the British Agent did not even suggest any specifi c measures that they should have taken. In no country in the world can isolated crimes of this nature be prevented\u201d.43 This case also shows that the notion of reasonableness is often cited in relation with the concept of negligence when assess-ing the respect by States of their diligence obligation. In the old Alabama arbitration, for instance, the arbitral tribunal underlined that \u201cnotwithstanding the warnings\u201d the United Kingdom did not take the effective measures of prevention and thus found that there was \u201cnegligence\u201d 44 on the part of that State.\n5.2. \tAn Obligation to Enact Preventive Domestic Normative Measures?\nDoes the \u201cduty to prevent\u201d include a duty to enact legislation and domestic norma-tive measures? If we accept that such an autonomous obligation exists, we might slip from the kingdom of obligations of \u201cconduct\u201d to the one of obligations of \u201cresult\u201d. In the fi eld of human rights, several treaty bodies insist on the existence on an obligation \u201cto adopt laws for the effective protection of the rights and freedoms\u201d 45 proclaimed by human rights treaties. The responsibility of States has often been engaged by human rights treaty bodies for failure to adopt necessary domestic measures.46 \t\tWe maybe fi nd ourselves at the limits of the comparison between the theory of positive obligations in human rights law and the general international law due dili-gence principle. Indeed one could argue that the \u201cpositive obligation\u201d to take legisla-tive, judicial and administrative measures in the fi eld of human rights derives directly from the commitments of States under human rights treaties \u2013 such as Article 2(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.47 But could such an obliga-tion exist in the fi eld of cyber diligence without a specifi c treaty?\ncide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

Measures of prevention of cyber-attacks will require almost inevitably such legislative measures and many States have already expressed their concern to adapt their legislative framework in this fi eld.48 But since due diligence is an obligation of conduct States do have the choice of the best mea-sures to take depending of the circumstances. \nConsequently we come to one of the limits of due diligence in relation to low-intensity cyber operations. If we want to \u201cupgrade\u201d State\u2019s obligations concerning cyber diligence, in order to impose specifi c and detailed obligations on States the adoption of an international treaty would probably be necessary. One of the best examples of this is, of course, the Convention on Cybercrime adopted by the Council of Europe in 2001.49 This Convention provides for the harmonisation of the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offences in the area of cybercrime and also pro-vides for the domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investiga-tion and prosecution of such offences.50 These measures are very important but only a multilateral instrument can introduce such specifi c obligations.\nWhatever the conclusion \u2013 whether or not there is an obligation for State to enact domestic law in order to prevent cyber activities contrary to the rights of others States, it is interesting to note that, according to the tribunal in the Alabama case,  ciency of its legal means to justify its failure in due States cannot claim the insuffi\npresent Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\u201d, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, UN General Assembly, 19 December 1966, UN Treaty Series, Vol. 999, 1-14668. According to the Human Rights Committee, \u201c[i]t follows that, unless Covenant rights are already protected by their domestic laws or practices, States Parties are required on ratifi cation to make such changes to domestic laws and practices as are necessary to ensure their conformity with the Covenant. Where there are inconsisten-cies between domestic law and the Covenant, article 2 requires that the domestic law or practice be changed to meet the standards imposed by the Covenant\u2019s substantive guar-antees\u201d, Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 31:The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, 26/05/2004, para. 13.\n48 \tSeefor example French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI), supra note \t30, pp. 17\u201318.\n49 \tCouncil of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, European Treaty \tSeries \u2013 No. 185.\n50 \tSee especially Articles 2 to 8 which oblige State Parties to adopt legislative and other \tmeasures to establish as criminal offences: the illegal access to a computer (Article \t2); the illegal interception of computer data (Article 3); data interference (Article. 4); \tsystem interference (Article 5); misuse of devices (Article 6); computer-related forgery \t(Article 7); computer-related fraud (Articlet. 8), ibid.\n35\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\ndiligence.51 This means that in any situation a State cannot escape its obligation by invoking the failure of its legislative apparatus.\n6. \tAn Obligation to Protect Cyber Infrastructure?\nRelated to the question of adoption of an adequate legislation stands the question of whether a State has an obligation to protect its cyber infrastructure against any interference or misuse. \n\tAccording to the US International Strategy for Cyberspace, cybersecurity due diligence implies that \u201cStates should recognize and act on their responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure national systems from damage or misuse\u201d.52 In the same vein the French Livre Blanc sur la D\u00e9fense focused on the need of securing vital infrastructure.53 \n\tIn March 2010, the UN General Assembly adopted also a very interesting reso-lution entitled \u201cCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity and taking stock of national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures\u201d.54Annexed to this Resolution the UN General Assembly adopted a \u201cVoluntary self-assessment tool for national efforts to protect critical information infrastructures calls States to deter-mine and assess the protection of their vital infrastructure\u201d.\n\tBut whatever the interest of these incentives, the question is to know whether due diligence includes an obligation for States to protect their own cyber infrastruc-tures. The answer should be that due diligence requires States to take \u201call appropri-ate measures\u201d in order to avoid cyber-attacks. If a State totally failed to secure its own cyber infrastructure, a failure which then authorised hostile groups to use this infrastructure as a weapon, the responsibility of the State could be engaged. As the ICJ judged in the Genocide case, \u201cviolation of the obligation to prevent results from omission\u201d.55 \n\tBut unlike the adoption of legislation, States are not equal when they try to protect their infrastructures. In the Alabama case the US said that due diligence \u201cis a diligence proportioned to the magnitude of the subject and to the dignity and \n131.\n52 \tThe White House, supra note 4, p. 10.\n53 \tLivre Blanc: D\u00e9fense et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale, 2013, p. 106.

The proportionality of the requirement is directly linked with the reasonable-ness criterion of the principle of prevention described above.57 \n\tHowever, it should be underlined that failure to adopt legislation or to protect cyber infrastructure will not immediately constitute a breach of due diligence.58 Indeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of due diligence. As stated by the International Law Commission in its Article 14(3) on State Responsibility, \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d.59 \n\tThis leads us to a last series of questions concerning the obligation of reaction which, undoubtedly, is the most well-known element of the duty of diligence. \n7. \tAn Obligation to React \nIt is well established that, under the due diligence principle, States have an obligation to notify and warn the potential victims of the cyber-attacks. This obligation to notify has been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.60\nVol.1, pp. 572\u2013573.The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this fi eld raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an obligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want to secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly benefi t in helping developing countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution 64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the digital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications technologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the trans-fer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training\u201d, A/Res/64/211, supra note 54.\n57 \tSee supra section 5.1.\nAccording to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have 58 \nnever affi rmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent the occurrence of a possible event suffi ced in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence of such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State\u201d, in R. \nAgo, \u2018Seventh report in State Responsibility\u2019, I:1 ILC Yearbook (1978) para. 11, p. 34. See in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.\n59 \tInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Interna-\ttionally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.\n60 \tAccording to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general noti-\tfi cation to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been \t\t\t cult, perhaps even impossible. But this would certainly not have prevented the Alba-diffi \n\tnian authorities from taking, as they should have done, all necessary steps immediately \tto warn ships near the danger zone, more especially those that were approaching that \tzone\u201d, ICJ, Corfu Channel case, supra note 6, pp. 22\u201323.\n37\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nKarine Bannelier-Christakis\n\tBut the obligation to react is not just an obligation to notify. As the Tallinn Manual has rightly recognised, in case of injury to another State the State where the cyber operation takes place will be obliged to use all means at its disposal \u201cto terminate the activity\u201d.61 If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not controversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could raise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different tools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties countries and civilians. There is in this fi\n eld an obligation for States to assess the necessity of their reaction and its proportionality.62 \n\tOf course, as always, this test is not an easy one. But it is nonetheless necessary in order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of due diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evalu-ation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take once again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law and especially human rights law. As stated by the US International Strategy for the Cyber Space, freedom of expression, intellectual property and rights to privacy are among these fundamental freedoms that State should protect.63 \n\tMoreover States have an obligation to investigate and punish the authors of such acts. Once again we can recall that in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ found that an indication of Albanian\u2019s knowledge of what was occurring was the fact that Albania, after the events affecting the United Kingdom took place, did not inquire into the event nor proceeded to judicial investigation \u201cincumbent, in such a case, on the ter-ritorial sovereign\u201d.64 \n\tThe case law of the human rights treaty bodies is also very clear in this fi eld. Due diligence includes a duty to investigate. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights famously proclaimed in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case:\nThe State is obligated to investigate every situation involving a violation of the \nrights protected by the Convention. If the State apparatus acts in such a way that \nthe violation goes unpunished. \u2026 the State has failed to comply with its duty. \u2026 In \ncertain circumstances, it may be diffi cult to investigate acts that violate individual \nboth state must be assess to determine whether this remedial measure is required. The test in such circumstances is one of reasonableness\u201d, ibid., p. 27, para. 4.\n63 \tThe White House, supra note 4, pp. 23\u201324.\n64 \tAs the Court pronounced, \u201c[a]nother indication of the Albanian Government\u2019s knowl-\tedge consists in the fact that that Government did not notify the presence of mines in \tits waters, at the moment when it must have known this \u2026 further, whereas the Greek \tGovernment immediately appointed a Commission to inquire into the events of October \t22, the Albanian Government took no decision of such a nature, nor did it proceed to \tthe judicial investigation incumbent, in such a case, on the territorial sovereign\u201d, Corfu \tChannel case, supra note 6, pp. 19\u201320. \n38\nDownloaded from Brill.com 02/21/2024 06:03:40PM \nvia University College London\nA Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?\nrights. The duty to investigate, like the duty to prevent, is not breached merely \nbecause the investigation does not produce a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it \nmust be undertaken in a serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained \nto be ineffective \u2026 Where the acts of private parties that violate the Convention \nare not seriously investigated, those parties are aided in a sense by the government, thereby making the State responsible on the international plan.65\nBy obliging States to adopt criminal sanctions that are \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d 66 including the possibility of prison sentences, the European Convention on Cybercrime could be a reference in this fi eld. \n8. \tConclusion: Towards a Cooperative Cyber Diligence?\nDue diligence is not only an obligation of reaction; it is also an obligation of knowl-edge and of prevention. This does not mean that this obligation is of \u201chigh intensity\u201d. Its nature as an obligation of means/conduct based on the criterion of \u201creasonable-ness\u201d means that States do not carry a too heavy burden. The diffi culty to apprehend activities in cyberspace makes its application even more complicated. \n\tThe due diligence principle derived from general international law is certainly \t\t\t ght against States that could be a useful starting point in order to organise the fi \ntempted to turn their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber haven\u201d or \u201ccyber paradise\u201d for cyber criminals or even cyber terrorists. It is also important that this principle does not authorise States to turn, in the name of their duty to protect the rights of other States, their territory into a kind of \u201ccyber hell\u201d destroying the freedom of speech and the right to privacy. But, as useful and balanced as this principle might be, the ubiquity of cyber operations makes it diffi cult for States to implement the principle alone. The development of a notion of \u201ccooperative cyber diligence\u201d will probably be necessary in the future to harmonise the efforts of the international community and to ensure the effectiveness of the principle. But if we want to go further and to \u201cupgrade\u201d this cyber diligence obligation we should think about the adoption in the future of a universal instrument on cybersecurity proposing a right balance between these competitive interests.\nof 29 July 1988, Cn\u00b0 4, paras. 176\u2013177.

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire national territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control its cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and conse-quently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect in the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive mea-sures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the separatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.\nKeywords: international human rights law, due diligence, cyberspace, effective control, Ilas\u0327cu case\n1. INTRODUCTION\nVarious contemporary territorial conflicts have resulted in areas falling outside the effective con-\ntrol of the sovereign state (territorial state) \u2013 such as Transnistria (1992), Nagorno-Karabakh\n(1988\u201394), South Ossetia (1991\u201392, 2008) and Abkhazia (1992\u201393), Crimea (2014) and the sep-\naratist areas in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to date) \u2013 or vast territories controlled by extremist terrorist\ngroups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State (2014 to date).1The state\u2019s lack of effective\ncontrol over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is tradition-\nally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign\nterritory.2Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various\nreasons, such as an armed conflict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered\nby an another subject of international law3\u2013 various norms of international law that bind the\n* University of Pretoria, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the SARChI Professorship on International Constitutional Law (Professor Erika de Wet); Visiting scholar, Manchester International Law Centre, University of Manchester;  (comments welcome).

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed conflict, the law of non-international armed\nconflict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be filled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo (governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-nificantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had difficulties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these deficiencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13have identified certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14Specifically in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine 2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights Cannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force 1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force 3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017, para 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017, Explanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership Countries, 3 May 2017, ; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April 2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the Temporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16and occupying states,17the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19\u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother. Section 3 confirms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the ter-\nritorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the\ncyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights\narising from sovereignty. Section 5 applies the rules of IHRL to the obligations of the territorial\n15 In the same sense see Timothy S Wu, \u2018Cyberspace Sovereignty: The Internet and the International System Notes\u2019 (1996) 10 Harvard Journal of Law and Technology 647.\n16 eg, Andrew Clapham, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors (Oxford University Press 2006) 271\u2013316; Katharine Fortin, The Accountability of Armed Groups under Human Rights Law (Oxford University Press 2017) 240\u201384; Murray (n 5) 120\u2013271.\n17 eg, Eyal Benvenisti, \u2018The Applicability of Human Rights Conventions to Israel and to the Occupied Territories\u2019(1992) 26 Israel Law Review 24; Orna Ben-Naftali and Yuval Shany, \u2018Living in Denial: The Application of Human Rights in the Occupied Territories\u2019 (2004) 1 Israel Law Review 17; John Cerone, \u2018Human Dignity in the Line of Fire: The Application of International Human Rights Law during Armed Conflict, Occupation, and Peace Operations\u2019 (2006) 39 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1447; Danio Campanelli, \u2018The Law of Military Occupation Put to the Test of Human Rights Law\u2019 (2008) 90 International Review of the Red Cross 653; Noam Lubell, \u2018Human Rights Obligations in Military Occupation\u2019 (2012) 94 International Review of the Red Cross 317.\n18 Karine Bannelier-Christakis, \u2018Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations\u2019 (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23; Russell Buchan, \u2018Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm\u2019 (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 429; Gabor Rona and Lauren Aarons, \u2018State Responsibility to Respect, Protect and Fulfill Human Rights Obligations in Cyberspace\u2019 (2016) 8 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 503; Matthew J Sklerov,\u2018Solving the Dilemma of Sate Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent\u2019 (2009) 201 Military Law Review 1.\n19 Tsagourias (n 4).\n20 Rona and Aarons (n 18) 506\u201309.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nstate in the context of cyberspace in areas outside its effective control.

CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21 It is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders creating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22and its innovative nature seems to provoke new problems in law, especially in international law.\n\tThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be defined as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real space, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 first of all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication technology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23 \n\tIn other words, it is a fictional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the phenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-munications technology (ICT). It follows from the above definition that cyberspace has three layers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network), and a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network (cyber-persona layer).24Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical architecture.25\n\t\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia, telecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26This article focuses on those cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-nationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are more relevant than others in the cyber context. In this regard, the Tallinn Manual, a non-binding expert commentary on the international law applicable to cyber operations, is of guidance as it\n21 John P Barlow, \u2018A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u2019, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 8 February 1996, .

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online. The violations in cyberspace have been committed by various\nactors, especially non-state de facto authorities, an outside state controlling the area and/or the\nterritorial state.\n27 Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, Cambridge University Press 2017) 2\u20133; International Law Commission (ILC), Second Report on the Protection of the Environment in relation to Armed Conflicts, submitted by Marie G Jacobsson, Special Rapporteur (28 May 2015), UN Doc A/CN.4/685, para 180.\n28 Schmitt, ibid 187 para 1.

Censorship,42physical harassment of online journalists,43\nand information blockade have characterised recent occupations.

Invoking national security or the fight against terrorism, vari-\nous territorial states have had recourse to extreme forms of information blockade, such as block-\ning websites without a proper investigation and a court decision,46or shutting down the internet\nin the area outside their control47or even nationwide.48The said measures unduly restrict online\ncommunication in a given area, whereas freedom of expression should apply \u2018regardless of\nfrontiers\u2019.49\nWhile online human rights violations might be committed in normal circumstances in any\nstate\u2019s government-controlled territory, the characteristic of the situations referred to above is\nthe limited capacity of the territorial state to prevent, repress and redress those wrongful acts.\nIn fact, the territorial states concerned have often reiterated their inability to implement their\nobligations with regard to human rights treaties50in general, and with regard to a treaty that\nspecifically imposes obligations in respect of cyberspace, the Budapest Convention on\nCybercrimes,51in particular.

Therefore, as far as the territorial state might control cyber activities from the government-administered area, it might retain limited power with regard to online human rights violations committed in the area outside its effective control.\nThe existence of areas that escape the effective control of the territorial state not only facil-itates massive human rights violations, but may constitute a threat to international peace and security.55The UN Security Council has expressed concern over the fact that ISIL used the inter-net and social media as promotional and recruitment tools for terrorist purposes56and for the online sale of Iraqi and Syrian antiquities.57Considering that the atrocities committed by ISIL may amount to crimes against humanity and possibly genocide,58the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 has been applied.59Accordingly, the Security Council has underlined \u2018the need for Member States to act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communica-tions and resources to incite support for terrorist acts\u201960and reiterated that \u2018the primary\n52 ICT for Peace Foundation and UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (UNCTED), \u2018Private Sector Engagement in Responding to the Use of the Internet and ICT for Terrorist Purposes: Strengthening\n.\n53 Peter Margulies, \u2018Surveillance by Algorithm: The NSA, Computerized Intelligence Collection, and Human Rights\u2019 (2017) 68 Florida Law Review 1045, 1088; Nadiya Kostyuk, \u2018Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?\u2019 in Kenneth Geers (ed), Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine (NATO CCD COE Publications 2015) 115.\n54 Marie Baezner, \u2018Cyber and Information Warfare in the Ukrainian Conflict\u2019, Center for Security Studies (CSS) Cyber Defense Project, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 2017, 10.\n55 UNSC Res 2170 (15 August 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2170, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2249 (20 November 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2249, preambular para 8.\n56 UNSC Res 2170, ibid, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2395 (21 December 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2395, preambular para 27.\n57 UNSC Res 2199 (12 February 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2199, para 16.\n58 Human Rights Council, \u2018Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, \u201cThey Came to Destroy\u201d: ISIS Crimes Against the Yazidis\u2019 (15 June 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/32/CRP.2.\n59 See the first pillar of the theory of \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019: UNGA Res 60/1(24 October 2005), UN Doc A/RES/60/1(2005), para 138, and the numerous resolutions of the Security Council confirming this obligation: eg, recently UNSC Res 2399 (30 January 2018), UN Doc S/RES/2399, preambular para 3; UNSC Res 2337 (19 January 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2337, preambular para 9.

This double\ndifficulty of control, over the online and offline spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at first sight cyberspace hardly fits within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by definition, trans-\nboundary character.66However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67Today it is widely recognised by states68and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-lar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties governing cyberspace has increased.70 \n\tThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a novel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless telegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-cations in their territory.71Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-trol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and that a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference in the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through radio.72To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the same principles apply.73 \n\tThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the supreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74 even though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75The physical layer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-tual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a specific state.76 \n\tState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether by legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77In other words, it is the competence of a state to regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the first international treaty to regulate conduct in the cyberspace;

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-ereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside their effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpecifically in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-ating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-tion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise jurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-stantial effect in its territory\u2019.87As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective restatement of the lex lata and,88as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction reflects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\n\tThe first of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a person or an object in the territory of the state provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of juris-diction by that state.89Since information and communication technologies require some physical infrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-ities in their national territory.90 \n\tFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-munications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the state.91The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control is thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such as cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-ities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s territory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-ment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity completed in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Therefore, the current tendency of state practice is to interpret territorial jurisdiction broadly, where any substantial connection between the cyber activity and state territory might serve as a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.94 \n\tRelated to an area outside the state\u2019s effective control, this type of jurisdiction might lead to various scenarios. Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-pleted in the area concerned95and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance. Under \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-ity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist fighters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the violation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even in another state.96 \n\tThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-dictional link accepted to reflect customary international law:97where an activity does not emanate from or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain domestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98some scholars contest its applicability as it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-sites in all countries.99The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-ability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the state and the cyber activity than is applied in the offline world.100Accordingly, the territorial state will have jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-fusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber activities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66. 95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the offline context. Indeed, states101and international organisations102have\nrecognised that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical offline space in that area\nmust be clarified.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 defined above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, ; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet Governance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, ; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace, Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, .\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/ 13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015 (n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet Freedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society, Tunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation CM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nand omissions of the state authorities performed or which produce effects outside their own ter-\nritory,105even without a lawful basis.106However, as a principal rule, international human rights\nconventions enshrine a primarily territorial notion of jurisdiction, which they apply within the\nstate party\u2019s national territory.107\nThe two types of jurisdiction in IHRL, extraterritorial and territorial, leads to the obligations\nof two states in the cyber context: first, one that effectively controls the territory (Section 4.1),\nand second, the territorial state (Section 4.2).\n4.1.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-tion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its authority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or rebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the territory of the State concerned\u2019.124The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-cising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\n\tThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held that it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain even where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to take all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the whole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set up, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-ritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual jurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-ial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does not affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131including human rights treaties.132Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s effective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of its jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond confirming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clarified the kind of positive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-ive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and sufficient\u2019 measures in order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective control.133The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state under Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive obligations towards persons within its territory. The state in question must endeavour, with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-\u00e0-vis foreign states and international organisations, to continue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention.\nIn the case of human rights violations committed by de facto authorities in the area, the ECtHR will verify whether the territorial state has complied with a minimum threshold in the particular circumstances \u2013 \u2018to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made\u2019.135The territorial state\u2019s positive obligations relate both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to\n127 ibid paras 20\u201321; Assanidze (n 2) para 140; ECtHR, Sargsyan v Azerbaijan, App no 40167/06, Admissibility, 14 December 2011, paras 64\u201365.\n128 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49).\n129 Reservations and Declarations for Treaty (n 50). \n130 ECHR (n 29) art 56.\n131 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 39. \n132 ibid art 15(1).\n133 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 334.\n134 ibid para 333.\n135 Ibid para 334.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nmeasures to ensure respect for the applicants\u2019 rights\u2019.136The obligation to re-establish control\nover the territory requires the territorial state, \u2018first, to refrain from supporting the separatist\nregime and, secondly, to act by taking all the political, judicial and other measures at its disposal\nfor re-establishing control over that territory\u2019.137\nThe second aspect of the territorial state\u2019s positive obligation to ensure respect for individ-\nuals\u2019 rights includes \u2018the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that it is in its\npower to take and are in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights\nguaranteed by the Convention\u2019.138The availability of those measures is context-dependent and\nmonitoring bodies will examine their use on a case-by-case basis.\nIn the Ilas\u00e7u judgment of the ECtHR six dissenting judges opposed the jurisdiction of Moldova,\nholding that there was no evidence of the state\u2019s direct or indirect authority over, or acquiescence in\nthe commission of the human rights violations in Transnistria.139Similarly, some commentators con-\nsider the judgment to be too strict with regard to Moldova.140However, subsequent case law shows\nunanimity or an overwhelming majority in the judgments regarding Moldova\u2019s responsibility.141\nIt seems that the ECtHR did not set the threshold too high, considering that the judgment cited\nseveral concrete examples where the measures taken by the Moldovan government produced real\neffects on the lives of individuals in Transnistria in general, or the applicants in particular.142The\nmeasures taken by the territorial state that the Court accepted as complying with its positive\nobligations consisted, for instance, of diplomatic acts such as protests or negotiation,143non-\nrecognition of the illegal situation,144investigative or judicial measures operated in the\ngovernment-controlled area,145provision of certain socio-economic benefits for individuals in\n136 ibid para 339; ECtHR.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations in IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state having lost its territorial control, as it guarantees flexibility in assessing its particular situation. The state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-tive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it knew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154The first condition \u2013 known also as the \u2018capacity to influence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155\u2013 assesses the actual means in the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human rights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty, still depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations. Accordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective power in the particular situation. According to the second condition, the state is responsible only if the human rights violation actually occurred and if the state was aware of, or should\n146 Catan (n 136) para 147; ECtHR Vardanean v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 22200/10, 30 May 2017, para 42.\n147 Ivan\u0163oc (n 143) para 109; Vardanean, ibid para 42.\n148 Island of Palmas Case (n 80) 839.\n149 Trail Smelter Case (US, Canada) (1938, 1941) III UNRIAA 1965; in the same sense Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\n150 Corfu Channel case, ibid 18.\n151 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay) (Merits) [2010] ICJ Rep 14, 55\u201356 [101]. 152 Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22; Timo Koivurova, \u2018Due Diligence\u2019, (2010) MPEPIL, para 2.\n153 Case of Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Merits) (1988) Inter-Am CtHR, Judgment of 29 July 1988, (Ser C) No 4, [172].\n154 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, [430]\u2013[431].\n155 ibid [430].\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nnormally have learned of the risk of the violation.156In respect of areas outside the effective con-\ntrol of the state, actual knowledge and available means is to be assessed to establish whether the\nterritorial state complied with its due diligence \u2013 as is the practice of the ECtHR in its case law.\nIt could be argued that the threshold set by the ECtHR in separatist areas is too demanding,\nbinding only on states parties to the ECHR, a regional treaty enshrining one of the highest stan-\ndards. However, UN Charter-based human rights bodies157and universal treaty monitoring bod-\nies158have reiterated the same standard and addressed various positive obligations with regard to\nindividuals in areas outside government control in their concluding observations on territorial\nstates.159While the ECtHR has based this case law on the necessity to cover the European\n\u2018legal space\u2019 by the effective application of the ECHR160and to eliminate \u2018vacuums\u2019 at the\nregional level,161UN treaty monitoring bodies seek to ensure the universality of human rights\nwith the same practice. The irrebuttable presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction in\nIHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights treaties (the\n\u2018legal space\u2019 and elimination of the vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal\nlevel), but also with the concept of the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 of the territorial state.162It is\nperhaps too early to speak of an established customary norm,163but at least international\nhuman rights treaties are interpreted in accordance with the above mentioned practice.164\nThe obligation not to allow the state\u2019s territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of\nother states or individuals binds the state in every activity performed in its territory, including\n156 ibid [431]; Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22 (\u2018the laying of the minefield which caused the explosions on October 22nd, 1946, could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government\u2019). 157 Human Rights Council (n 115) para 41; Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u2018Mission to the Republic of Moldova\u2019 (12 February 2009), UN Doc A/HRC/10/44/ Add.3, para 6.\n158 The Human Rights Committee has recently elaborated a general comment, providing that \u2018a State party has an obligation to respect and to ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all persons subject to its jurisdiction\u2019.

It equally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-gation to protect167and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes of international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of the Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168However, given the almost universal ratification of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide ratification of regional human rights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the next section, due diligence and the specific positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely, within the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-side its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-national law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169This sug-gests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative framework.170Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-ties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state in IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have recognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law (Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-viders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171 However, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-trol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace, it appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the online context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-tioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has complied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, ; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden Journal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37, para 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression (12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nto measures to ensure respect for the individual applicants\u2019 rights\u2019172(Section 5.3). Before exam-ining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the focus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-tions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights monitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the territorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s obligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-tions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to life of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment through online means,173and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to racial hatred174or to terrorism.175In this regard, there is no difference between government-controlled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial state in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or filtering commu-nications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176A first possible legal basis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of emergency. Under such a derogation, a state may suspend provisionally the application of one or more human rights, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation at a time of sufficiently grave crisis that threatens the life of the nation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.177While the territorial state may derogate in respect of certain human rights, such as freedom of expression, it cannot limit\n172 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339; Catan (n 136) para 145; Mozer (n 136) para 151.\n173 Cyber threats might cause mental suffering of such severity that would violate the prohibition of torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment: ECtHR G\u00e4fgen v Germany, App no 22978/05, 1 June 2010, para 108; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 20: Article 7 (27 May 2008), UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9 (Vol I), 200\u201302 para 5.\n174 CERD (n 30) art 4; ICCPR (n 29) art 20; CERD, General Recommendation No 35: Combating Racist Hate Speech (26 September 2013), UN Doc CERD/C/GC/35.\n175 UNSC Res 2253 (17 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2253 (2015), para 22; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression (10 August 2011), UN Doc A/66/290, para 81.\n176 eg, the Ukrainian presidential decree of 16 May 2017 targeted \u2018legal entities of the Russian Federation, the activity of which threatens information and cyber security of Ukraine\u2019: see Human Rights Committee (n 6) para 95, n 103.\n177 ECHR (n 29) art 15(1); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(1); American Convention on Human Rights (entered into force 18 July 1978) 1144 UNTS 143 (ACHR), art 27(1); Arab Charter on Human Rights (entered into force 15 March 2008), (2005) 12 International Human Rights Reports 893, art 4(b).\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nthe application of non-derogable rights,178nor the totality of human rights affected by the loss of\neffective control, and it should regularly review the derogation.179\nSecond, even beyond emergency situations, international human rights treaties permit the\nlawful restriction of freedom of expression, if prescribed by law and to the extent necessary to\nensure national security, territorial integrity, the protection of the rights of others or the preven-\ntion of disorder or crime.180The protection of the existence of the nation, its territorial integrity\nand political independence against the use of or threat of force might justify the invocation of\nnational security,181provided that the conventional limits of restricting freedom of expression\nare respected. As the Human Rights Committee held:182\nAny restrictions on the operation of websites, blogs or any other internet-based, electronic or other such\ninformation dissemination system, including systems to support such communication, such as internet\nservice providers or search engines, are only permissible to the extent that they are compatible with\nparagraph 3 [of Article 19 of the ICCPR on freedom of expression].\nFurthermore, \u2018[p]ermissible restrictions generally should be content-specific; generic bans on the\noperation of certain sites and systems are not compatible with paragraph 3\u2019.183Human rights\ntreaty bodies allow national authorities to restrict a given communication only in proportion to\nthe nature and extent of its perceived threat to national security or other protected interests.184\nIn other words, states parties have a negative obligation not to interfere with freedom of expres-\nsion, unless the restriction is prescribed by law, made in the interests of the admitted legitimate\npurposes, and satisfies the necessity and proportionality test. The same three-part test applies in\nsituations of armed conflict where international humanitarian law applies simultaneously.185\n178 ECHR (n 29) art 15(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(2) and Second Optional Protocol (entered into force 11 July 1991) 999 UNTS 414, art 6; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29: States of Emergency (Article 4) (31 August 2001), UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, paras 8, 13, 15; ACHR, ibid arts 4(c), 27(2). 179 ECHR (n 29) art 15(3); ECtHR, Brannigan and McBride v United Kingdom, App nos 14553/89 and 14554/89, 23 May 1993, para 54; ICCPR (n 29) art 4(3); ACHR (n 177) art 27(3); Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29, ibid para 4.\n180 ECHR (n 29) art 10(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 19(3)(b); ACHR (n 177) art 13(2)(b); a contrario, see, without any express limitation, African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, art 9 (for the implied limitations, see below n 184). 181 \u2018The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Symposium: Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Principles\u2019 (1985) 7 Human Rights Quarterly 3, 6 para 29.\n182 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43.\n183 ibid.\n184 Human Rights Committee, Keun-Tae Kim v Republic of Korea, Communication No 574/1994, views of 4 January 1999, UN Doc CCPR/C/64/D/574/1994, paras 12.4\u201312.5; and Jong-Kyu Sohn v Republic of Korea, Communication No 518/1992, 3 August 1995, UN Doc CCPR/C/54/D/518/1992, para 10.4; ECtHR, Jankovskis v Lithuania, App no 21575/08, 17 January 2017, paras 61\u201363; ECtHR, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey, App no 3111/10, 18 December 2012, para 66 and concurring opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque; AfrCtHPR, Ingabire Victoire Umuhoza v Republic of Rwanda, App no 003/2014, Judgment of 24 November 2017, [161]\u2013[162].\n185 OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Responses to Conflict Situations (4 May 2015), UN/OSCE/OAS/ACHPR, para 2(c), .\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nUnqualified and broadly defined monitoring of the content of internet communications, such as nationwide filtering measures, is likely to be considered an unlawful restriction of freedom of expression and the right of access to information.186The a posteriori (after publication) blocking or filtering of clearly specified unlawful content can be considered lawful, however, to protect the rights and interests of others and of society as a whole if the above-mentioned conditions of per-mitted restrictions are satisfied, even without notice from the alleged victims or from third parties.187\n5.2. MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-sures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere expression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188irrespective of the inef-fectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the territorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189Such measures could be considered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to re-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191 While it is indeed difficult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals rather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter standard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-ment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193and to reassert its responsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and internationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-matic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to normalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194The measures to re-establish control over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending access to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14, 12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Reflections on Evolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143. 191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Office 1906) 962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nstate.195The internet is a channel through which the state can fulfil human rights, such as the\nright to education, the right to vote and the right to an effective remedy for citizens from the\narea outside the state\u2019s effective control.196Therefore, measures that aim to re-establish \u2018internet\nsovereignty\u2019 are likely to satisfy the requirements of the ECtHR. For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate. However, it is problematic if the state restricts internet/telecommu-\nnications for an extended period in order to re-assert control over its territory, while the same\nmeasures violate individuals\u2019 human rights and thus run against the third type of obligation\n(below). For instance, in the context of the Iraqi fight against online propaganda and terrorist\nrecruitment by ISIL, the Iraqi government ordered internet service providers to shut down the\ninternet in the five provinces under ISIL control in June 2014.201In fact, the measures aimed\nto re-establish control over territory/cyberspace should be taken within the limits defined by inter-\nnational law202in general, and IHRL in particular. The three-part test referred to above deter-\nmines the lawful restriction of qualified human rights, especially freedom of expression.

MEASURES INTENDED TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS\u2019 RIGHTS\nWhile cyberspace is considered largely as embodying freedom of internet communication, the free flow of information and respect for the right to freedom of opinion and expression,205entail-ing mainly negative obligations on the part of the state, does not exclude positive obligations to protect individuals against human rights violations by third parties. In recent years, human rights treaty monitoring bodies have clarified various positive obligations that states have in cyberspace.206 \n\tAs mentioned above, in areas outside the effective control of the state special measures with the aim of protecting the rights of individuals include positive duties \u2018to take the diplomatic, eco-nomic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with inter-national law\u2019.207As a translation of the due diligence standard, the anticipated measures depend on the context and must be reasonable \u2013 commensurate with the territorial state\u2019s limited ability to protect human rights in an area outside its effective control.208In the face of online human rights violations, the most relevant measures are providing remedies (5.3.1) and preventive mea-sures (5.3.2).\n5.3.1. PROVIDING REMEDIES\nAs the territorial state does not have physical access to the elements of the breach (the victim, the perpetrator or the ICT infrastructure) situated in the area, its judicial and investigative authorities are limited to the area under the control of the government. Its obligation to provide remedies should consist of enabling the victim to inform the state authorities \u2018of the details of his situation and to be kept informed of the various legal and diplomatic actions taken\u2019.209It may be possible to enable individuals to seek a remedy remotely, such as by allowing files to be sent\n203 CERD, Concluding Observations: Germany (30 June 2015), UN Doc CERD/C/DEU/CO/19\u201322, para 9(c). 204 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43; Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression\u2019(30 March 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/35/22, paras 8\u201316; OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet, 1 June 2011, para 6(b), .\n205 Iginio Gagliardone and others, Countering Online Hate Speech (UNESCO 2015) 5; ECtHR, KU v Finland, App no 2872/02, 2 December 2008, para 49 (recognising freedom of expression and confidentiality of commu-nications for users of telecommunications and internet services as \u2018primary considerations\u2019 on the one hand, and the state\u2019s positive obligations to reconcile the various human rights which compete for protection in the cyberspace on the other).\n206 eg, ECtHR, KU v Finland, ibid paras 46\u201349; ECtHR, F\u00e9ret v Belgium, App no 15615/07, 16 July 2009, paras 72\u201373, 78; ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, para 159; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 15.\n207 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 340; Catan (n 136) paras 109\u2013110; Mozer (n 136) paras 99\u2013100.\n208 Mozer (n 136) para 216.\n209 ibid para 214.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nelectronically, providing information about remedies and communicating via Skype or email with\ncitizens from the area outside its effective control.210Similarly, universal treaty bodies have\nrecommended that states guarantee access to toll-free helplines for victims in all regions within\ntheir territory.211Another way of complying with the obligation to provide a remedy is to create,\nin the government-controlled territory, \u2018a set of judicial, investigative and civil service authorities\nwhich work in parallel\u2019 with those created by the de facto authorities.212While the effects of any\ndecisions taken by these authorities can be felt only outside the conflict area, they have the func-\ntion of enabling cases to be brought in the proper manner before the territorial state\u2019s authorities,\n\u2018which can then initiate diplomatic and legal steps to attempt to intervene in specific cases\u2019.213\nThe territorial state is required to undertake to investigate cybercrimes committed in the area\noutside its effective control.214Even though denied access to the area, the territorial state should\ninitiate all investigative procedures commensurate with its limited ability,215for instance, by\nkeeping thorough documentation on the victims of human rights violations.216The absence of\nterritorial control and access to evidence on the spot is in itself a less important obstacle in\nthe case of cyber activities than in the case of offline human rights violations, because the former\ncan be investigated from remote places.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to influence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed conflict with grave\nhuman rights violations offline, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291, 293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras 237\u201338, 241\u201357. The difference between the rulings of the Chamber and the Grand Chamber is the extent to which the state is expected to take reasonable steps to cooperate. Contrary to the Chamber, the Grand Chamber held that supplying the whole investigation file to the de facto authorities would be unreasonable, as it \u2018would amount in substance to a transfer of the criminal case by Cyprus to the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts, and Cyprus would thereby be waiv-ing its criminal jurisdiction\u2019 over the crime: ibid para 253; a contrario, considering the majority judgment as the rejection of the territorial state\u2019s procedural obligation to cooperate with the TRNC, see the partly dissenting opin-ion of Judges Karakas\u0327 and Pejchal, para 11.\n233 G\u00fczelyurtlu [Chamber], ibid para 238 (Republic of Cyprus) and partly dissenting opinion of Judge Serghides, para 47(h), (o); G\u00fczelyurtlu [GC], ibid paras 207\u201308 (Republic of Cyprus).\n234 CEDAW, Concluding Observations: Georgia (24 July 2014), UN Doc CEDAW/C/GEO/CO/4-5, para 13; Olga Demian, \u2018Strengthening the Respect for Human Rights in the Implementation of the Republic of Moldova\u2019s Digital Agenda, Report on Human Rights Protection on the Internet\u2019, CoE Consultant, December 2015, para 7.1.12, , 67.\n235 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA), Merits, Judgment, [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 85 [157]; Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) 221 [430].\n236 CERD, Concluding Observations: Ukraine (4 October 2016), UN Doc CERD/C/UKR/CO/22-23, para 12. 237 CRC, Concluding Observations: Iraq (n 159) para 19(b); on online slave auctions by ISIL, see Human Rights Council (n 58) paras 57, 118.\n238 In favour of such an existing customary norm, Sklerov (n 18) 71; in favour of an \u2018emerging norm\u2019, Erik Talbot Jensen, \u2018Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead\u2019 (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 275, 299; Bannelier-Christakis (n 18) 32\u201336.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nin cyberspace.239IHRL, however, enshrines special duties of prevention that are not limited to the duty to react to and repress ongoing human rights violations in cyberspace, but expects effective measures to prevent violations by third parties if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such abuse will occur.240 \n\tHuman rights monitoring bodies have interpreted various treaty provisions as requiring pre-ventive measures to combat online human rights violations in ordinary situations of governmental control over territory. Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly monitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241identify internet service providers with a view to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242collaborate with the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243establish\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have materialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.244The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-sures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government control.\n\tFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245for example, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-latory scope to the entire territory.246The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is enforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law duty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least under 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247 \n\tA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the government-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide services in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could regulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-controlled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-nications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication using the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249With regard to those private actors, due diligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance from its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250In the case of belligerent occupation, however, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive measures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights control mechanisms.251 \n\tWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance between the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content to prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point test. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in five Iraqi provinces under ISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-viders to disrupt the use of specific websites and social media by those associated with extremist groups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist fighters.252 \n\tWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether a minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253The thresh-old of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the actual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-mission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-lations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take positive measures to protect the victim.254 \n\tThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the standard of action required in the particular case.

Feasibility depends, among others, \u2018on the technical wherewithal of the state concerned, the intellectual and financial resources at its disposal, the state\u2019s institutional capacity to take measures, and the extent of its control over cyber infrastructure\u2019 located in the government-controlled territory.255 \n\tThis capacity is to a large extent technical, often referred to as \u2018virtual power\u2019256or \u2018virtual control\u2019, understood as the \u2018ability to intercept, store, analyse and use communications\u2019.257Since governments might have very different relationships with the internet and telecommunications companies that could facilitate surveillance, their capacity to access directly the undersea cables and other carriers of internet and telephonic communications might be different. However, \u2018vir-tual power\u2019 or \u2018virtual control\u2019 is not the only factor that determines the capacity of the territorial state to comply with its due diligence. Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-nical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-sure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned preventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-controlled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over the area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective territorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-ritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction of the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-ritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-ventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the latter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in its territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment [1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of Surveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Defending the Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

The territorial state is obliged to use its investigative and judicial capabilities, legislate and regulate non-state actors in the entire national territory, and seek international cooperation in reacting to online human rights violations.\nAs a result of technological progress, the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction is a fortiori applicable to cyberspace where the state can ensure the re-establishment of its control over human rights violations, even in the absence of territorial control. Given that most territorial states retain some information and telecommunications infrastructures in their government-controlled area, applying the so-called due diligence standard to human rights in cyberspace in areas outside the effective control of the territorial state is feasible. Consequently, national legislation, cyber security strategies, military manuals and doctrinal commentaries like the Tallinn Manual258should expressly recognise that the state is presumed to have jurisdiction under IHRL over its entire territory, even in the absence of effective control over it.\nA revised Tallinn Manual should integrate the due diligence standard in its chapter on IHRL with a view to conceptualising the obligation to protect259and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes applicable to cyber operations. More generally, it should further take into account the obligations flowing from international human rights treaties, especially those applied universally.\n258 Schmitt (n 27) 182\u201384 (rule 34 \u2013 Applicability). \n259 ibid 197\u2013201.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at .

Notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both territory and cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in international human rights law is the territorial state\u2019s presumed jurisdiction over its entire national territory. The article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to control its cyberspace fully as it does in the government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction, and conse-quently obligations, to protect human rights online from wrongful acts that originate, occur or have effect in the area outside its effective control. Treaty monitoring bodies have recommended various positive mea-sures that any territorial state is required to take while seeking to restore its \u2018internet sovereignty\u2019 in the separatist region, depending on the means in its power that are feasible in the particular situation.\nKeywords: international human rights law, due diligence, cyberspace, effective control, Ilas\u0327cu case\n1. INTRODUCTION\nVarious contemporary territorial conflicts have resulted in areas falling outside the effective con-\ntrol of the sovereign state (territorial state) \u2013 such as Transnistria (1992), Nagorno-Karabakh\n(1988\u201394), South Ossetia (1991\u201392, 2008) and Abkhazia (1992\u201393), Crimea (2014) and the sep-\naratist areas in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to date) \u2013 or vast territories controlled by extremist terrorist\ngroups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State (2014 to date).1The state\u2019s lack of effective\ncontrol over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is tradition-\nally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign\nterritory.2Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various\nreasons, such as an armed conflict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered\nby an another subject of international law3\u2013 various norms of international law that bind the\n* University of Pretoria, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the SARChI Professorship on International Constitutional Law (Professor Erika de Wet); Visiting scholar, Manchester International Law Centre, University of Manchester;  (comments welcome). I thank the anonymous reviewers and the edi-torial team of the Israel Law Review for their most helpful comments.\n1 The article will not focus on other areas outside the effective control of the territorial state such as Northern Cyprus or Western Sahara, where there are no reported human rights violations in the cyberspace.\n2 ECtHR, Assanidze v Georgia, App no 71503/01, 8 April 2004, para 139; G\u00e9rard Kreijen, State Failure, Sovereignty and Effectiveness: Legal Lessons from the Decolonization of Sub-Saharan Africa (Martinus Nijhoff 2004) 204.\n3 The major precedents are international territorial administrations and leases of territory: see Markus Benzing,\u2018International Administration of Territories\u2019 (2010) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law; Ya\u00ebl Ronen, \u2018Territory, Lease\u2019 (2008) Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law.

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed conflict, the law of non-international armed\nconflict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be filled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo (governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-nificantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities). A contemporary prece-dent for leased territory is the Bay of Guant\u00e1namo under Cuban sovereignty but under US control: Agreement for the Lease to the United States of Lands in Cuba for Coaling and Naval Stations, signed at Havana, 16 February 1903, and at Washington, 23 February 1903, entered into force 23 February 1903, Charles I Bevans, Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America, Department of State, vol 6, 1113\u201315, art III. 4 Nicholas Tsagourias, \u2018Non-State Actors, Ungoverned Spaces and International Responsibility for Cyber Acts\u2019(2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 455; Anne L Clunan and Harold A Trinkunas (eds), Ungoverned Spaces: Alternatives to State Authority in an Era of Softened Sovereignty (Stanford Security Studies 2010); Steven Boraz and others, Ungoverned Territories: Understanding and Reducing Terrorism Risks (NBN 2007); Robert D Lamb, Ungoverned Areas and Threats from Safe Havens: Final Report of the Ungoverned Areas Project (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)) 2008).\n5 Michael Schoiswohl, \u2018De Facto Regimes and Human Rights Obligations: The Twilight Zone of Public International Law\u2019 (2001) 6 Austrian Review of International and European Law 45, 78\u201379; Daragh Murray, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Armed Groups (Hart 2016) 126\u201328; Anthony Cullen and Steven Wheatley, \u2018The Human Rights of Individuals in De Facto Regimes under the European Convention on Human Rights\u2019 (2013) 13 Human Rights Law Review 691, 717\u201323.\n6 According to this theory, any subject undertaking effective control over the area is bound by the international human rights obligations of the territorial sovereign. This theory is confirmed in Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 26: Continuity of Obligations (8 December 1997), UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.8/ Rev.1, para 4; International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Prosecutor v Mucic\u0301, Judgment, IT-96-21-A, Appeals Chamber, 20 February 2001, para 111.\n7 eg, Samantha Besson, \u2018Concurrent Responsibilities under the European Convention on Human Rights: The Concurrence of Human Rights Jurisdictions, Duties and Responsibilities\u2019 in Anne van Aaken and Iulia Motoc (eds), The European Convention on Human Rights and General International Law (Oxford University Press 2018).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had difficulties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these deficiencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13have identified certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14Specifically in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine 2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights Cannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force 1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force 3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017, para 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017, Explanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership Countries, 3 May 2017, ; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April 2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the Temporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16and occupying states,17the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19\u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother. Section 3 confirms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the ter-\nritorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the\ncyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights\narising from sovereignty. Section 5 applies the rules of IHRL to the obligations of the territorial\n15 In the same sense see Timothy S Wu, \u2018Cyberspace Sovereignty: The Internet and the International System Notes\u2019 (1996) 10 Harvard Journal of Law and Technology 647.\n16 eg, Andrew Clapham, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Actors (Oxford University Press 2006) 271\u2013316; Katharine Fortin, The Accountability of Armed Groups under Human Rights Law (Oxford University Press 2017) 240\u201384; Murray (n 5) 120\u2013271.\n17 eg, Eyal Benvenisti, \u2018The Applicability of Human Rights Conventions to Israel and to the Occupied Territories\u2019(1992) 26 Israel Law Review 24; Orna Ben-Naftali and Yuval Shany, \u2018Living in Denial: The Application of Human Rights in the Occupied Territories\u2019 (2004) 1 Israel Law Review 17; John Cerone, \u2018Human Dignity in the Line of Fire: The Application of International Human Rights Law during Armed Conflict, Occupation, and Peace Operations\u2019 (2006) 39 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 1447; Danio Campanelli, \u2018The Law of Military Occupation Put to the Test of Human Rights Law\u2019 (2008) 90 International Review of the Red Cross 653; Noam Lubell, \u2018Human Rights Obligations in Military Occupation\u2019 (2012) 94 International Review of the Red Cross 317.\n18 Karine Bannelier-Christakis, \u2018Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations\u2019 (2014) 14 Baltic Yearbook of International Law 23; Russell Buchan, \u2018Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm\u2019 (2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 429; Gabor Rona and Lauren Aarons, \u2018State Responsibility to Respect, Protect and Fulfill Human Rights Obligations in Cyberspace\u2019 (2016) 8 Journal of National Security Law and Policy 503; Matthew J Sklerov,\u2018Solving the Dilemma of Sate Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent\u2019 (2009) 201 Military Law Review 1.\n19 Tsagourias (n 4).\n20 Rona and Aarons (n 18) 506\u201309.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nstate in the context of cyberspace in areas outside its effective control.

CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21 It is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders creating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22and its innovative nature seems to provoke new problems in law, especially in international law.\n\tThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be defined as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real space, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 first of all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication technology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23 \n\tIn other words, it is a fictional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the phenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-munications technology (ICT). It follows from the above definition that cyberspace has three layers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network), and a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network (cyber-persona layer).24Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical architecture.25\n\t\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia, telecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26This article focuses on those cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-nationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are more relevant than others in the cyber context. In this regard, the Tallinn Manual, a non-binding expert commentary on the international law applicable to cyber operations, is of guidance as it\n21 John P Barlow, \u2018A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u2019, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 8 February 1996, .

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online. The violations in cyberspace have been committed by various\nactors, especially non-state de facto authorities, an outside state controlling the area and/or the\nterritorial state.\n27 Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, Cambridge University Press 2017) 2\u20133; International Law Commission (ILC), Second Report on the Protection of the Environment in relation to Armed Conflicts, submitted by Marie G Jacobsson, Special Rapporteur (28 May 2015), UN Doc A/CN.4/685, para 180.\n28 Schmitt, ibid 187 para 1.

Invoking national security or the fight against terrorism, vari-\nous territorial states have had recourse to extreme forms of information blockade, such as block-\ning websites without a proper investigation and a court decision,46or shutting down the internet\nin the area outside their control47or even nationwide.48The said measures unduly restrict online\ncommunication in a given area, whereas freedom of expression should apply \u2018regardless of\nfrontiers\u2019.49\nWhile online human rights violations might be committed in normal circumstances in any\nstate\u2019s government-controlled territory, the characteristic of the situations referred to above is\nthe limited capacity of the territorial state to prevent, repress and redress those wrongful acts.\nIn fact, the territorial states concerned have often reiterated their inability to implement their\nobligations with regard to human rights treaties50in general, and with regard to a treaty that\nspecifically imposes obligations in respect of cyberspace, the Budapest Convention on\nCybercrimes,51in particular.

Therefore, as far as the territorial state might control cyber activities from the government-administered area, it might retain limited power with regard to online human rights violations committed in the area outside its effective control.\nThe existence of areas that escape the effective control of the territorial state not only facil-itates massive human rights violations, but may constitute a threat to international peace and security.55The UN Security Council has expressed concern over the fact that ISIL used the inter-net and social media as promotional and recruitment tools for terrorist purposes56and for the online sale of Iraqi and Syrian antiquities.57Considering that the atrocities committed by ISIL may amount to crimes against humanity and possibly genocide,58the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 has been applied.59Accordingly, the Security Council has underlined \u2018the need for Member States to act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communica-tions and resources to incite support for terrorist acts\u201960and reiterated that \u2018the primary\n52 ICT for Peace Foundation and UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (UNCTED), \u2018Private Sector Engagement in Responding to the Use of the Internet and ICT for Terrorist Purposes: Strengthening\n.\n53 Peter Margulies, \u2018Surveillance by Algorithm: The NSA, Computerized Intelligence Collection, and Human Rights\u2019 (2017) 68 Florida Law Review 1045, 1088; Nadiya Kostyuk, \u2018Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?\u2019 in Kenneth Geers (ed), Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine (NATO CCD COE Publications 2015) 115.\n54 Marie Baezner, \u2018Cyber and Information Warfare in the Ukrainian Conflict\u2019, Center for Security Studies (CSS) Cyber Defense Project, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 2017, 10.\n55 UNSC Res 2170 (15 August 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2170, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2249 (20 November 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2249, preambular para 8.\n56 UNSC Res 2170, ibid, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2395 (21 December 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2395, preambular para 27.\n57 UNSC Res 2199 (12 February 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2199, para 16.\n58 Human Rights Council, \u2018Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, \u201cThey Came to Destroy\u201d: ISIS Crimes Against the Yazidis\u2019 (15 June 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/32/CRP.2.\n59 See the first pillar of the theory of \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019: UNGA Res 60/1(24 October 2005), UN Doc A/RES/60/1(2005), para 138, and the numerous resolutions of the Security Council confirming this obligation: eg, recently UNSC Res 2399 (30 January 2018), UN Doc S/RES/2399, preambular para 3; UNSC Res 2337 (19 January 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2337, preambular para 9.

This double\ndifficulty of control, over the online and offline spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at first sight cyberspace hardly fits within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by definition, trans-\nboundary character.66However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67Today it is widely recognised by states68and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-lar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties governing cyberspace has increased.70 \n\tThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a novel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless telegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-cations in their territory.71Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-trol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and that a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference in the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through radio.72To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the same principles apply.73 \n\tThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the supreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74 even though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75The physical layer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-tual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a specific state.76 \n\tState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether by legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77In other words, it is the competence of a state to regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the first international treaty to regulate conduct in the cyberspace;

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-ereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside their effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpecifically in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-ating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-tion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise jurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-stantial effect in its territory\u2019.87As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective restatement of the lex lata and,88as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction reflects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\n\tThe first of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a person or an object in the territory of the state provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of juris-diction by that state.89Since information and communication technologies require some physical infrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-ities in their national territory.90 \n\tFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-munications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the state.91The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control is thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such as cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-ities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s territory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-ment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity completed in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Therefore, the current tendency of state practice is to interpret territorial jurisdiction broadly, where any substantial connection between the cyber activity and state territory might serve as a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.94 \n\tRelated to an area outside the state\u2019s effective control, this type of jurisdiction might lead to various scenarios. Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-pleted in the area concerned95and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance. Under \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-ity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist fighters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the violation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even in another state.96 \n\tThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-dictional link accepted to reflect customary international law:97where an activity does not emanate from or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain domestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98some scholars contest its applicability as it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-sites in all countries.99The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-ability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the state and the cyber activity than is applied in the offline world.100Accordingly, the territorial state will have jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-fusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber activities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66. 95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the offline context. Indeed, states101and international organisations102have\nrecognised that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical offline space in that area\nmust be clarified.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 defined above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, ; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet Governance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, ; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace, Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, .\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/ 13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015 (n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet Freedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society, Tunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation CM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nand omissions of the state authorities performed or which produce effects outside their own ter-\nritory,105even without a lawful basis.106However, as a principal rule, international human rights\nconventions enshrine a primarily territorial notion of jurisdiction, which they apply within the\nstate party\u2019s national territory.107\nThe two types of jurisdiction in IHRL, extraterritorial and territorial, leads to the obligations\nof two states in the cyber context: first, one that effectively controls the territory (Section 4.1),\nand second, the territorial state (Section 4.2).\n4.1. THE JURISDICTION OF THE OUTSIDE STATE\nExtraterritorial jurisdiction under IHRL may have two alternative preconditions, based on effect-\niveness over persons (the personal model):108whether cyber activities by a state could give rise to\nthe personal model and, if they could, what is the required level of effectiveness over the person\nabroad?109For present purposes it suffices to note that physical control over foreign territory\nentails the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state.

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\nBeyond an external state having extraterritorial jurisdiction in the area under IHRL, human\nrights treaty bodies have clarified that the territorial state also continues to have jurisdiction\nin the part of its territory where it has lost effective control.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-tion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its authority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or rebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the territory of the State concerned\u2019.124The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-cising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\n\tThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held that it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain even where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to take all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the whole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set up, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-ritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual jurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-ial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does not affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131including human rights treaties.132Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s effective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of its jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond confirming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clarified the kind of positive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-ive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and sufficient\u2019 measures in order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective control.133The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state under Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive obligations towards persons within its territory.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations in IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state having lost its territorial control, as it guarantees flexibility in assessing its particular situation. The state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-tive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it knew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154The first condition \u2013 known also as the \u2018capacity to influence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155\u2013 assesses the actual means in the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human rights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty, still depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations. Accordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective power in the particular situation. According to the second condition, the state is responsible only if the human rights violation actually occurred and if the state was aware of, or should\n146 Catan (n 136) para 147; ECtHR Vardanean v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 22200/10, 30 May 2017, para 42.\n147 Ivan\u0163oc (n 143) para 109; Vardanean, ibid para 42.\n148 Island of Palmas Case (n 80) 839.\n149 Trail Smelter Case (US, Canada) (1938, 1941) III UNRIAA 1965; in the same sense Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\n150 Corfu Channel case, ibid 18.\n151 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay) (Merits) [2010] ICJ Rep 14, 55\u201356 [101]. 152 Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22; Timo Koivurova, \u2018Due Diligence\u2019, (2010) MPEPIL, para 2.\n153 Case of Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Merits) (1988) Inter-Am CtHR, Judgment of 29 July 1988, (Ser C) No 4, [172].\n154 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, [430]\u2013[431].\n155 ibid [430].\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nnormally have learned of the risk of the violation.156In respect of areas outside the effective con-\ntrol of the state, actual knowledge and available means is to be assessed to establish whether the\nterritorial state complied with its due diligence \u2013 as is the practice of the ECtHR in its case law.\nIt could be argued that the threshold set by the ECtHR in separatist areas is too demanding,\nbinding only on states parties to the ECHR, a regional treaty enshrining one of the highest stan-\ndards. However, UN Charter-based human rights bodies157and universal treaty monitoring bod-\nies158have reiterated the same standard and addressed various positive obligations with regard to\nindividuals in areas outside government control in their concluding observations on territorial\nstates.159While the ECtHR has based this case law on the necessity to cover the European\n\u2018legal space\u2019 by the effective application of the ECHR160and to eliminate \u2018vacuums\u2019 at the\nregional level,161UN treaty monitoring bodies seek to ensure the universality of human rights\nwith the same practice. The irrebuttable presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction in\nIHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights treaties (the\n\u2018legal space\u2019 and elimination of the vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal\nlevel), but also with the concept of the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 of the territorial state.162It is\nperhaps too early to speak of an established customary norm,163but at least international\nhuman rights treaties are interpreted in accordance with the above mentioned practice.164\nThe obligation not to allow the state\u2019s territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of\nother states or individuals binds the state in every activity performed in its territory, including\n156 ibid [431]; Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22 (\u2018the laying of the minefield which caused the explosions on October 22nd, 1946, could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government\u2019). 157 Human Rights Council (n 115) para 41; Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u2018Mission to the Republic of Moldova\u2019 (12 February 2009), UN Doc A/HRC/10/44/ Add.3, para 6.\n158 The Human Rights Committee has recently elaborated a general comment, providing that \u2018a State party has an obligation to respect and to ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all persons subject to its jurisdiction\u2019.

It equally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-gation to protect167and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes of international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of the Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168However, given the almost universal ratification of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide ratification of regional human rights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the next section, due diligence and the specific positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely, within the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-side its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-national law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169This sug-gests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative framework.170Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-ties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state in IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have recognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law (Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-viders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171 However, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-trol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace, it appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the online context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-tioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has complied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, ; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden Journal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37, para 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression (12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nto measures to ensure respect for the individual applicants\u2019 rights\u2019172(Section 5.3). Before exam-ining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the focus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-tions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights monitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the territorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s obligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-tions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to life of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment through online means,173and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to racial hatred174or to terrorism.175In this regard, there is no difference between government-controlled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial state in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or filtering commu-nications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176A first possible legal basis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of emergency. Under such a derogation, a state may suspend provisionally the application of one or more human rights, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation at a time of sufficiently grave crisis that threatens the life of the nation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.177While the territorial state may derogate in respect of certain human rights, such as freedom of expression, it cannot limit\n172 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339; Catan (n 136) para 145; Mozer (n 136) para 151.\n173 Cyber threats might cause mental suffering of such severity that would violate the prohibition of torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment: ECtHR G\u00e4fgen v Germany, App no 22978/05, 1 June 2010, para 108; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 20: Article 7 (27 May 2008), UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9 (Vol I), 200\u201302 para 5.\n174 CERD (n 30) art 4; ICCPR (n 29) art 20; CERD, General Recommendation No 35: Combating Racist Hate Speech (26 September 2013), UN Doc CERD/C/GC/35.\n175 UNSC Res 2253 (17 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2253 (2015), para 22; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression (10 August 2011), UN Doc A/66/290, para 81.\n176 eg, the Ukrainian presidential decree of 16 May 2017 targeted \u2018legal entities of the Russian Federation, the activity of which threatens information and cyber security of Ukraine\u2019: see Human Rights Committee (n 6) para 95, n 103.\n177 ECHR (n 29) art 15(1); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(1); American Convention on Human Rights (entered into force 18 July 1978) 1144 UNTS 143 (ACHR), art 27(1); Arab Charter on Human Rights (entered into force 15 March 2008), (2005) 12 International Human Rights Reports 893, art 4(b).\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nthe application of non-derogable rights,178nor the totality of human rights affected by the loss of\neffective control, and it should regularly review the derogation.179\nSecond, even beyond emergency situations, international human rights treaties permit the\nlawful restriction of freedom of expression, if prescribed by law and to the extent necessary to\nensure national security, territorial integrity, the protection of the rights of others or the preven-\ntion of disorder or crime.180The protection of the existence of the nation, its territorial integrity\nand political independence against the use of or threat of force might justify the invocation of\nnational security,181provided that the conventional limits of restricting freedom of expression\nare respected. As the Human Rights Committee held:182\nAny restrictions on the operation of websites, blogs or any other internet-based, electronic or other such\ninformation dissemination system, including systems to support such communication, such as internet\nservice providers or search engines, are only permissible to the extent that they are compatible with\nparagraph 3 [of Article 19 of the ICCPR on freedom of expression].\nFurthermore, \u2018[p]ermissible restrictions generally should be content-specific; generic bans on the\noperation of certain sites and systems are not compatible with paragraph 3\u2019.183Human rights\ntreaty bodies allow national authorities to restrict a given communication only in proportion to\nthe nature and extent of its perceived threat to national security or other protected interests.184\nIn other words, states parties have a negative obligation not to interfere with freedom of expres-\nsion, unless the restriction is prescribed by law, made in the interests of the admitted legitimate\npurposes, and satisfies the necessity and proportionality test. The same three-part test applies in\nsituations of armed conflict where international humanitarian law applies simultaneously.185\n178 ECHR (n 29) art 15(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(2) and Second Optional Protocol (entered into force 11 July 1991) 999 UNTS 414, art 6; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29: States of Emergency (Article 4) (31 August 2001), UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, paras 8, 13, 15; ACHR, ibid arts 4(c), 27(2). 179 ECHR (n 29) art 15(3); ECtHR, Brannigan and McBride v United Kingdom, App nos 14553/89 and 14554/89, 23 May 1993, para 54; ICCPR (n 29) art 4(3); ACHR (n 177) art 27(3); Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29, ibid para 4.\n180 ECHR (n 29) art 10(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 19(3)(b); ACHR (n 177) art 13(2)(b); a contrario, see, without any express limitation, African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, art 9 (for the implied limitations, see below n 184). 181 \u2018The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Symposium: Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Principles\u2019 (1985) 7 Human Rights Quarterly 3, 6 para 29.\n182 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43.\n183 ibid.\n184 Human Rights Committee, Keun-Tae Kim v Republic of Korea, Communication No 574/1994, views of 4 January 1999, UN Doc CCPR/C/64/D/574/1994, paras 12.4\u201312.5; and Jong-Kyu Sohn v Republic of Korea, Communication No 518/1992, 3 August 1995, UN Doc CCPR/C/54/D/518/1992, para 10.4; ECtHR, Jankovskis v Lithuania, App no 21575/08, 17 January 2017, paras 61\u201363; ECtHR, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey, App no 3111/10, 18 December 2012, para 66 and concurring opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque; AfrCtHPR, Ingabire Victoire Umuhoza v Republic of Rwanda, App no 003/2014, Judgment of 24 November 2017, [161]\u2013[162].\n185 OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Responses to Conflict Situations (4 May 2015), UN/OSCE/OAS/ACHPR, para 2(c), .\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nUnqualified and broadly defined monitoring of the content of internet communications, such as nationwide filtering measures, is likely to be considered an unlawful restriction of freedom of expression and the right of access to information.186The a posteriori (after publication) blocking or filtering of clearly specified unlawful content can be considered lawful, however, to protect the rights and interests of others and of society as a whole if the above-mentioned conditions of per-mitted restrictions are satisfied, even without notice from the alleged victims or from third parties.187\n5.2. MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-sures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere expression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188irrespective of the inef-fectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the territorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189Such measures could be considered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to re-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191 While it is indeed difficult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals rather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter standard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-ment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193and to reassert its responsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and internationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-matic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to normalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194The measures to re-establish control over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending access to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14, 12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Reflections on Evolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143. 191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Office 1906) 962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nstate.195The internet is a channel through which the state can fulfil human rights, such as the\nright to education, the right to vote and the right to an effective remedy for citizens from the\narea outside the state\u2019s effective control.196Therefore, measures that aim to re-establish \u2018internet\nsovereignty\u2019 are likely to satisfy the requirements of the ECtHR. For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate. However, it is problematic if the state restricts internet/telecommu-\nnications for an extended period in order to re-assert control over its territory, while the same\nmeasures violate individuals\u2019 human rights and thus run against the third type of obligation\n(below). For instance, in the context of the Iraqi fight against online propaganda and terrorist\nrecruitment by ISIL, the Iraqi government ordered internet service providers to shut down the\ninternet in the five provinces under ISIL control in June 2014.201In fact, the measures aimed\nto re-establish control over territory/cyberspace should be taken within the limits defined by inter-\nnational law202in general, and IHRL in particular. The three-part test referred to above deter-\nmines the lawful restriction of qualified human rights, especially freedom of expression.

MEASURES INTENDED TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS\u2019 RIGHTS\nWhile cyberspace is considered largely as embodying freedom of internet communication, the free flow of information and respect for the right to freedom of opinion and expression,205entail-ing mainly negative obligations on the part of the state, does not exclude positive obligations to protect individuals against human rights violations by third parties. In recent years, human rights treaty monitoring bodies have clarified various positive obligations that states have in cyberspace.206 \n\tAs mentioned above, in areas outside the effective control of the state special measures with the aim of protecting the rights of individuals include positive duties \u2018to take the diplomatic, eco-nomic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with inter-national law\u2019.207As a translation of the due diligence standard, the anticipated measures depend on the context and must be reasonable \u2013 commensurate with the territorial state\u2019s limited ability to protect human rights in an area outside its effective control.208In the face of online human rights violations, the most relevant measures are providing remedies (5.3.1) and preventive mea-sures (5.3.2).\n5.3.1. PROVIDING REMEDIES\nAs the territorial state does not have physical access to the elements of the breach (the victim, the perpetrator or the ICT infrastructure) situated in the area, its judicial and investigative authorities are limited to the area under the control of the government. Its obligation to provide remedies should consist of enabling the victim to inform the state authorities \u2018of the details of his situation and to be kept informed of the various legal and diplomatic actions taken\u2019.209It may be possible to enable individuals to seek a remedy remotely, such as by allowing files to be sent\n203 CERD, Concluding Observations: Germany (30 June 2015), UN Doc CERD/C/DEU/CO/19\u201322, para 9(c). 204 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43; Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression\u2019(30 March 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/35/22, paras 8\u201316; OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet, 1 June 2011, para 6(b), .\n205 Iginio Gagliardone and others, Countering Online Hate Speech (UNESCO 2015) 5; ECtHR, KU v Finland, App no 2872/02, 2 December 2008, para 49 (recognising freedom of expression and confidentiality of commu-nications for users of telecommunications and internet services as \u2018primary considerations\u2019 on the one hand, and the state\u2019s positive obligations to reconcile the various human rights which compete for protection in the cyberspace on the other).\n206 eg, ECtHR, KU v Finland, ibid paras 46\u201349; ECtHR, F\u00e9ret v Belgium, App no 15615/07, 16 July 2009, paras 72\u201373, 78; ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, para 159; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 15.\n207 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 340; Catan (n 136) paras 109\u2013110; Mozer (n 136) paras 99\u2013100.\n208 Mozer (n 136) para 216.\n209 ibid para 214.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nelectronically, providing information about remedies and communicating via Skype or email with\ncitizens from the area outside its effective control.210Similarly, universal treaty bodies have\nrecommended that states guarantee access to toll-free helplines for victims in all regions within\ntheir territory.211Another way of complying with the obligation to provide a remedy is to create,\nin the government-controlled territory, \u2018a set of judicial, investigative and civil service authorities\nwhich work in parallel\u2019 with those created by the de facto authorities.212While the effects of any\ndecisions taken by these authorities can be felt only outside the conflict area, they have the func-\ntion of enabling cases to be brought in the proper manner before the territorial state\u2019s authorities,\n\u2018which can then initiate diplomatic and legal steps to attempt to intervene in specific cases\u2019.213\nThe territorial state is required to undertake to investigate cybercrimes committed in the area\noutside its effective control.214Even though denied access to the area, the territorial state should\ninitiate all investigative procedures commensurate with its limited ability,215for instance, by\nkeeping thorough documentation on the victims of human rights violations.216The absence of\nterritorial control and access to evidence on the spot is in itself a less important obstacle in\nthe case of cyber activities than in the case of offline human rights violations, because the former\ncan be investigated from remote places. As a first channel, the authorities of the territorial state\ncan monitor publicly available (open source) stored computer data.217A second method of inves-\ntigation is through mutual legal assistance requested from a third state where information tech-\nnology storing relevant data is located.218However, states hosting the largest cyber service\nproviders like the United Kingdom or the United States rarely allow the sharing of digital evi-\ndence and might impose restrictions on companies sharing content data with foreign\n210 For some good practices of Ukrainian relocated courts see OSCE (n 196); Mozer (n 136) para 214. 211 CRC, Concluding Observations: Georgia (9 March 2017), UN Doc CRC/C/GEO/CO/4, para 24(e); CEDAW, Concluding Observations: Azerbaijan (12 March 2015), UN Doc CEDAW/C/AZE/CO/5, para 23(d). 212 Mozer (n 136) para 215.\n213 ibid.\n214 In the same sense see certain NGOs: Promo-LEX, \u2018Resolution on Ensuring and Guaranteeing Free and Secure Internet Access to all Citizens of the Republic of Moldova, including the Transnistrian Region\u2019, 2016, .\n215 eg, Mozer (n 136) paras 215\u201316; ECtHR, Draci v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 5349/02, 17 October 2017, para 61; ECtHR, Stomatii v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 69528/10, 18 September 2018, paras 71\u201372.\n216 In their non-binding concluding observations, the treaty bodies have interpreted the duty to investigate violations of physical integrity (torture, enforced disappearance) in this sense: eg, CAT, Concluding Observations: Ukraine (n 159) para 11(a); CAT, Concluding Observations: Iraq (7 September 2015), UN Doc CAT/C/IRQ/CO/1, para 12(b) (victims of inhuman treatment); Committee on Enforced Disappearances, Concluding Observations: Iraq (13 October 2015), UN Doc CED/C/IRQ/CO/1, para 23.\n217 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 32(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) art 40(1).\n218 eg, Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) arts 29(1), 31(1), 33(1); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) arts 37, 39, 41.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to influence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed conflict with grave\nhuman rights violations offline, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291, 293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras 237\u201338, 241\u201357. The difference between the rulings of the Chamber and the Grand Chamber is the extent to which the state is expected to take reasonable steps to cooperate. Contrary to the Chamber, the Grand Chamber held that supplying the whole investigation file to the de facto authorities would be unreasonable, as it \u2018would amount in substance to a transfer of the criminal case by Cyprus to the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts, and Cyprus would thereby be waiv-ing its criminal jurisdiction\u2019 over the crime: ibid para 253; a contrario, considering the majority judgment as the rejection of the territorial state\u2019s procedural obligation to cooperate with the TRNC, see the partly dissenting opin-ion of Judges Karakas\u0327 and Pejchal, para 11.\n233 G\u00fczelyurtlu [Chamber], ibid para 238 (Republic of Cyprus) and partly dissenting opinion of Judge Serghides, para 47(h), (o); G\u00fczelyurtlu [GC], ibid paras 207\u201308 (Republic of Cyprus).\n234 CEDAW, Concluding Observations: Georgia (24 July 2014), UN Doc CEDAW/C/GEO/CO/4-5, para 13; Olga Demian, \u2018Strengthening the Respect for Human Rights in the Implementation of the Republic of Moldova\u2019s Digital Agenda, Report on Human Rights Protection on the Internet\u2019, CoE Consultant, December 2015, para 7.1.12, , 67.\n235 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA), Merits, Judgment, [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 85 [157]; Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) 221 [430].\n236 CERD, Concluding Observations: Ukraine (4 October 2016), UN Doc CERD/C/UKR/CO/22-23, para 12. 237 CRC, Concluding Observations: Iraq (n 159) para 19(b); on online slave auctions by ISIL, see Human Rights Council (n 58) paras 57, 118.\n238 In favour of such an existing customary norm, Sklerov (n 18) 71; in favour of an \u2018emerging norm\u2019, Erik Talbot Jensen, \u2018Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead\u2019 (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 275, 299; Bannelier-Christakis (n 18) 32\u201336.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nin cyberspace.239IHRL, however, enshrines special duties of prevention that are not limited to the duty to react to and repress ongoing human rights violations in cyberspace, but expects effective measures to prevent violations by third parties if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such abuse will occur.240 \n\tHuman rights monitoring bodies have interpreted various treaty provisions as requiring pre-ventive measures to combat online human rights violations in ordinary situations of governmental control over territory. Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly monitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241identify internet service providers with a view to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242collaborate with the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243establish\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have materialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.244The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-sures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government control.\n\tFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245for example, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-latory scope to the entire territory.246The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is enforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law duty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least under 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247 \n\tA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the government-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide services in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could regulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-controlled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-nications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication using the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249With regard to those private actors, due diligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance from its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250In the case of belligerent occupation, however, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive measures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights control mechanisms.251 \n\tWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance between the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content to prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point test. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in five Iraqi provinces under ISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-viders to disrupt the use of specific websites and social media by those associated with extremist groups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist fighters.252 \n\tWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether a minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253The thresh-old of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the actual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-mission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-lations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take positive measures to protect the victim.254 \n\tThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the standard of action required in the particular case.

Feasibility depends, among others, \u2018on the technical wherewithal of the state concerned, the intellectual and financial resources at its disposal, the state\u2019s institutional capacity to take measures, and the extent of its control over cyber infrastructure\u2019 located in the government-controlled territory.255 \n\tThis capacity is to a large extent technical, often referred to as \u2018virtual power\u2019256or \u2018virtual control\u2019, understood as the \u2018ability to intercept, store, analyse and use communications\u2019.257Since governments might have very different relationships with the internet and telecommunications companies that could facilitate surveillance, their capacity to access directly the undersea cables and other carriers of internet and telephonic communications might be different. However, \u2018vir-tual power\u2019 or \u2018virtual control\u2019 is not the only factor that determines the capacity of the territorial state to comply with its due diligence. Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-nical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-sure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned preventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-controlled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over the area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective territorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-ritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction of the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-ritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-ventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the latter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in its territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment [1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of Surveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Defending the Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

The territorial state is obliged to use its investigative and judicial capabilities, legislate and regulate non-state actors in the entire national territory, and seek international cooperation in reacting to online human rights violations.\nAs a result of technological progress, the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction is a fortiori applicable to cyberspace where the state can ensure the re-establishment of its control over human rights violations, even in the absence of territorial control. Given that most territorial states retain some information and telecommunications infrastructures in their government-controlled area, applying the so-called due diligence standard to human rights in cyberspace in areas outside the effective control of the territorial state is feasible. Consequently, national legislation, cyber security strategies, military manuals and doctrinal commentaries like the Tallinn Manual258should expressly recognise that the state is presumed to have jurisdiction under IHRL over its entire territory, even in the absence of effective control over it.\nA revised Tallinn Manual should integrate the due diligence standard in its chapter on IHRL with a view to conceptualising the obligation to protect259and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes applicable to cyber operations. More generally, it should further take into account the obligations flowing from international human rights treaties, especially those applied universally.\n258 Schmitt (n 27) 182\u201384 (rule 34 \u2013 Applicability). \n259 ibid 197\u2013201.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at .

INTRODUCTION\nVarious contemporary territorial conflicts have resulted in areas falling outside the effective con-\ntrol of the sovereign state (territorial state) \u2013 such as Transnistria (1992), Nagorno-Karabakh\n(1988\u201394), South Ossetia (1991\u201392, 2008) and Abkhazia (1992\u201393), Crimea (2014) and the sep-\naratist areas in Eastern Ukraine (2014 to date) \u2013 or vast territories controlled by extremist terrorist\ngroups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State (2014 to date).1The state\u2019s lack of effective\ncontrol over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is tradition-\nally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign\nterritory.2Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various\nreasons, such as an armed conflict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered\nby an another subject of international law3\u2013 various norms of international law that bind the\n* University of Pretoria, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the SARChI Professorship on International Constitutional Law (Professor Erika de Wet); Visiting scholar, Manchester International Law Centre, University of Manchester;  (comments welcome).

While each of those territorial situations gives rise to different\nlegal regimes (such as the law of international armed conflict, the law of non-international armed\nconflict, the territorial lease agreement), a common element is an apparent legal lacuna in con-\nventional human rights obligations of the international law subject that controls the territory.\nFurthermore, the actors controlling the area may be other states or even non-state actors (such\nas armed opposition groups, de facto regimes, international organisations), which may not be\naddressees of international law. Instead of the notion of \u2018ungoverned spaces\u2019, widely used in\nthe literature,4it is more accurate to recognise that various actors \u2013 which are often states\nother than the territorial state and non-state actors \u2013 exercise effective control over the territory.\nThis means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational\noperation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed\nto an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be filled by new, or newly\ninterpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the\nhuman rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory,5\nthe acquired human rights doctrine,6and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-\nstate actors) exercising powers in the given area.7Furthermore, as this article will emphasise,\neven the territorial state has residual obligations under international human rights law (IHRL).\nEast Timor (governed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999\u20132002) and Kosovo (governed by the civilian mission, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo from 2008, sig-nificantly reduced following the declaration of independence by the Kosovo authorities). A contemporary prece-dent for leased territory is the Bay of Guant\u00e1namo under Cuban sovereignty but under US control: Agreement for the Lease to the United States of Lands in Cuba for Coaling and Naval Stations, signed at Havana, 16 February 1903, and at Washington, 23 February 1903, entered into force 23 February 1903, Charles I Bevans, Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America, Department of State, vol 6, 1113\u201315, art III. 4 Nicholas Tsagourias, \u2018Non-State Actors, Ungoverned Spaces and International Responsibility for Cyber Acts\u2019(2016) 21 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 455; Anne L Clunan and Harold A Trinkunas (eds), Ungoverned Spaces: Alternatives to State Authority in an Era of Softened Sovereignty (Stanford Security Studies 2010); Steven Boraz and others, Ungoverned Territories: Understanding and Reducing Terrorism Risks (NBN 2007); Robert D Lamb, Ungoverned Areas and Threats from Safe Havens: Final Report of the Ungoverned Areas Project (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (OUSD(P)) 2008).\n5 Michael Schoiswohl, \u2018De Facto Regimes and Human Rights Obligations: The Twilight Zone of Public International Law\u2019 (2001) 6 Austrian Review of International and European Law 45, 78\u201379; Daragh Murray, Human Rights Obligations of Non-State Armed Groups (Hart 2016) 126\u201328; Anthony Cullen and Steven Wheatley, \u2018The Human Rights of Individuals in De Facto Regimes under the European Convention on Human Rights\u2019 (2013) 13 Human Rights Law Review 691, 717\u201323.\n6 According to this theory, any subject undertaking effective control over the area is bound by the international human rights obligations of the territorial sovereign. This theory is confirmed in Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 26: Continuity of Obligations (8 December 1997), UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.8/ Rev.1, para 4; International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Prosecutor v Mucic\u0301, Judgment, IT-96-21-A, Appeals Chamber, 20 February 2001, para 111.\n7 eg, Samantha Besson, \u2018Concurrent Responsibilities under the European Convention on Human Rights: The Concurrence of Human Rights Jurisdictions, Duties and Responsibilities\u2019 in Anne van Aaken and Iulia Motoc (eds), The European Convention on Human Rights and General International Law (Oxford University Press 2018).

The reasons for the apparent lack of clarity in the legal regime\nare various. First, human rights treaties impose obligations only on states;9second, they do\nnot foresee a lack of effective control of the state over part of its territory; and, third, the obliga-\ntions can hardly be enforced against other subjects that are de facto controlling the territory.\nFurthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the\nphysical space, but also in cyberspace.10Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion,\ndue process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which con-\ntrol the territory. Such actors have recourse to practices that restrict human rights online\nthrough censorship, the threat and manipulation of online media, undue blocking of access\nto certain websites or the internet as a whole, and dissemination of racial hatred and terrorist\npropaganda.11\nTerritorial states have had difficulties in preventing, repressing and redressing these wrongful\nacts. Notwithstanding these deficiencies, IHRL obliges the territorial state to take all measures\nwithin its power to protect human rights in the area outside its effective control.12The\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), treaty monitoring bodies and organisations based\non the UN Charter13have identified certain positive obligations that territorial states are required\nto take vis-\u00e0-vis persons situated in the area.14Specifically in the online context, those recom-\nmendations provide the basis for identifying various measures that any territorial state is required\n16 May\u201315 August 2017 (15 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.2 (Human Rights Council, Ukraine 2017), paras 182\u201384.\n8 Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (CoE PA), \u2018Areas where the European Convention on Human Rights Cannot be Implemented\u2019, Doc 9730, 11 March 2003, paras 1, 6.\n9 The exception is the possibility of having international organisations as signatories: eg, Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (entered into force 1 August 2014) CETS 210, art 75(1); Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (entered into force 3 May 2008) 2515 UNTS 3, art 42.\n10 CoE PA, Resolution 2141(2017), \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, 24 January 2017, para 12; CoE PA, \u2018Attacks against Journalists and Media Freedom in Europe\u2019, Doc 14229, 9 January 2017, Explanatory Memorandum, para 82; European Parliament, \u2018Media Freedom Trends 2017: Eastern Partnership Countries, 3 May 2017, ; UN Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Russian Federation (28 April 2015), UN Doc CCPR/C/RUS/CO/7, para 23(b); Human Rights Council, Situation of Human Rights in the Temporarily Occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol (Ukraine) (25 September 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/36/CRP.3, paras 154\u201361; Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR), Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine, 15 July 2014 (19 September 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/75, 161\u201362 para 152; Security Council, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (5 February 2015), UN Doc A/HRC/28/69, Annex II, paras 82, 259.

This article focuses accordingly on the territorial state\u2019s obli-\ngations in the context of cyberspace under IHRL. While other related topics \u2013 such as human\nrights obligations of non-state armed groups16and occupying states,17the duties of states in\ncyberspace,18and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors19\u2013 have been\nresearched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations\nof the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control. Through the\nexample of the territorial state\u2019s obligations, the article also addresses extensively debated ques-\ntions such as the applicability of sovereignty to cyberspace, the scope of application of IHRL20\nand of the due diligence standard in cyberspace.\nThe article claims that the territorial state, while lacking the effective means to fully control its\ncyberspace as it does in government-controlled areas, has continuing jurisdiction and positive\nobligations to protect human rights in cyberspace from wrongful acts that originate, occur or\nhave effect in the part of its territory outside its effective control. The article proceeds as follows.\nThe following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by\nthe state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over\nthe physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand,\nand the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the\nother. Section 3 confirms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the ter-\nritorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the\ncyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights\narising from sovereignty.

CYBERSPACE IN AREAS OUTSIDE THE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE TERRITORIAL STATE\n\u2018[Cyberspace] is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live\u2019.21 It is \u2018a \u201cborderless\u201d world \u2013 computer-based communications cut across territorial borders creating a new realm of human activity\u2019,22and its innovative nature seems to provoke new problems in law, especially in international law.\n\tThe term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 can be defined as \u2018[a] world-wide virtual space, different from real space, with many sub-communities unevenly distributed using a technical environment \u2013 first of all the internet \u2013 in which citizens and organizations utilize information and communication technology for their social and commercial interactions\u2019.23 \n\tIn other words, it is a fictional space (rather than having a tangible nature) used to describe the phenomenon of electronic signals transiting through the infrastructure of information and com-munications technology (ICT). It follows from the above definition that cyberspace has three layers: a physical layer (switches, routers, servers and cables), a software layer (logical network), and a third layer consisting of data packets and electronics \u2013 the people actually on the network (cyber-persona layer).24Despite its virtual nature, cyberspace necessarily requires a physical architecture.25\n\t\u2018Cyber activity\u2019 is a process in which information technology systems (including, inter alia, telecommunications and computer systems) are the means of activity.26This article focuses on those cyber activities that carry the risk of restricting human rights. While there is no inter-nationally accepted list of human rights that can be affected in cyberspace, certain rights are more relevant than others in the cyber context.

Examples are Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, South-Ossetia and Abkhazia,\nCrimea and the separatist areas in Eastern Ukraine, as well as vast territories controlled by\nextremist terrorist groups in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State. As mentioned above,\nthese areas are characterised not only by human rights violations in the physical territory but\nalso those committed online. The violations in cyberspace have been committed by various\nactors, especially non-state de facto authorities, an outside state controlling the area and/or the\nterritorial state.\n27 Michael N Schmitt (ed), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, Cambridge University Press 2017) 2\u20133; International Law Commission (ILC), Second Report on the Protection of the Environment in relation to Armed Conflicts, submitted by Marie G Jacobsson, Special Rapporteur (28 May 2015), UN Doc A/CN.4/685, para 180.\n28 Schmitt, ibid 187 para 1.

Invoking national security or the fight against terrorism, vari-\nous territorial states have had recourse to extreme forms of information blockade, such as block-\ning websites without a proper investigation and a court decision,46or shutting down the internet\nin the area outside their control47or even nationwide.48The said measures unduly restrict online\ncommunication in a given area, whereas freedom of expression should apply \u2018regardless of\nfrontiers\u2019.49\nWhile online human rights violations might be committed in normal circumstances in any\nstate\u2019s government-controlled territory, the characteristic of the situations referred to above is\nthe limited capacity of the territorial state to prevent, repress and redress those wrongful acts.\nIn fact, the territorial states concerned have often reiterated their inability to implement their\nobligations with regard to human rights treaties50in general, and with regard to a treaty that\nspecifically imposes obligations in respect of cyberspace, the Budapest Convention on\nCybercrimes,51in particular.

Therefore, as far as the territorial state might control cyber activities from the government-administered area, it might retain limited power with regard to online human rights violations committed in the area outside its effective control.\nThe existence of areas that escape the effective control of the territorial state not only facil-itates massive human rights violations, but may constitute a threat to international peace and security.55The UN Security Council has expressed concern over the fact that ISIL used the inter-net and social media as promotional and recruitment tools for terrorist purposes56and for the online sale of Iraqi and Syrian antiquities.57Considering that the atrocities committed by ISIL may amount to crimes against humanity and possibly genocide,58the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 has been applied.59Accordingly, the Security Council has underlined \u2018the need for Member States to act cooperatively to prevent terrorists from exploiting technology, communica-tions and resources to incite support for terrorist acts\u201960and reiterated that \u2018the primary\n52 ICT for Peace Foundation and UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (UNCTED), \u2018Private Sector Engagement in Responding to the Use of the Internet and ICT for Terrorist Purposes: Strengthening\n.\n53 Peter Margulies, \u2018Surveillance by Algorithm: The NSA, Computerized Intelligence Collection, and Human Rights\u2019 (2017) 68 Florida Law Review 1045, 1088; Nadiya Kostyuk, \u2018Ukraine: A Cyber Safe Haven?\u2019 in Kenneth Geers (ed), Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine (NATO CCD COE Publications 2015) 115.\n54 Marie Baezner, \u2018Cyber and Information Warfare in the Ukrainian Conflict\u2019, Center for Security Studies (CSS) Cyber Defense Project, ETH Z\u00fcrich, 2017, 10.\n55 UNSC Res 2170 (15 August 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2170, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2249 (20 November 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2249, preambular para 8.\n56 UNSC Res 2170, ibid, preambular para 13; UNSC Res 2395 (21 December 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2395, preambular para 27.\n57 UNSC Res 2199 (12 February 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2199, para 16.\n58 Human Rights Council, \u2018Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, \u201cThey Came to Destroy\u201d: ISIS Crimes Against the Yazidis\u2019 (15 June 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/32/CRP.2.\n59 See the first pillar of the theory of \u2018Responsibility to Protect\u2019: UNGA Res 60/1(24 October 2005), UN Doc A/RES/60/1(2005), para 138, and the numerous resolutions of the Security Council confirming this obligation: eg, recently UNSC Res 2399 (30 January 2018), UN Doc S/RES/2399, preambular para 3; UNSC Res 2337 (19 January 2017), UN Doc S/RES/2337, preambular para 9.

This double\ndifficulty of control, over the online and offline spaces, raises the question of how far cyberspace\nis subject to the territorial state\u2019s sovereignty in an area outside its effective control.\n3. STATE SOVEREIGNTY IN CYBERSPACE\nBecause of its non-physical character, at first sight cyberspace hardly fits within the traditional\nprinciples of public international law such as sovereignty or territorial integrity,64also enshrined\nin the UN Charter.65A considerable group of libertarian scholars argue that cyberspace should not\nbe regulated and subjected to state sovereignty, given its de-territorialised and, by definition, trans-\nboundary character.66However, the debate over whether cyberspace can or should be regulated\n\u2018has essentially waned and is largely a historical milestone\u2019, as noted by the International Law\nCommission (ILC).67Today it is widely recognised by states68and international law scholars69\n61 UNSC Res 2139 (22 February 2014), UN Doc S/RES/2139, paras 9, 12; UNSC Res 2254 (18 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2254, preambular para 4; UNSC Res 2258 (22 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2258, preambu-lar para 8 (\u2018the primary responsibility of the Syrian authorities to protect the population in Syria\u2019).\n62 Oren Gross, \u2018Cyber Responsibility to Protect: Legal Obligations of States Directly Affected by Cyber-Incidents\u2019(2015) 48 Cornell International Law Journal 481, 491\u201393.

Moreover, the number of international treaties governing cyberspace has increased.70 \n\tThe regulation of de-territorialised telecommunications activities, however, is not a novel domain of international law: from the very beginning of the invention of wireless telegraphy, states undertook to exercise their sovereignty over radiotelegraphic communi-cations in their territory.71Authors in the interwar period generally assumed that state con-trol was necessary to regulate the international use of telecommunication techniques, and that a state incurs international responsibility for breaching the prohibition on interference in the internal affairs of other countries by propaganda hostile to another state through radio.72To the extent that cyberspace is also a wireless form of telecommunication, the same principles apply.73 \n\tThe application of the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace has its main rationale in the supreme authority of the state to regulate any cyber infrastructure located within its territory,74 even though it may also exercise its sovereign prerogatives outside the territory.75The physical layer of cyberspace is therefore subject to the sovereignty of the territorial state, whereas the vir-tual domain of cyberspace does not fall within the sovereignty of a specific state.76 \n\tState sovereignty is closely related to state jurisdiction: the latter notion refers to the state\u2019s\u2018lawful power to act and hence to its power to decide whether and, if so, how to act, whether by legislative, executive, or judicial means\u2019.77In other words, it is the competence of a state to regulate persons, objects, and conduct under its domestic law, within the limits set by\nGroup of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015), UN Doc A/70/174 (GGE Report 2015), para 27.\n70 It is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49), signed in 2001, that was the first international treaty to regulate conduct in the cyberspace;

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sov-ereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside their effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.\nSpecifically in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elabor-ating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdic-tion over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise jurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019;\u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a sub-stantial effect in its territory\u2019.87As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective restatement of the lex lata and,88as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction reflects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.\n\tThe first of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a person or an object in the territory of the state provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of juris-diction by that state.89Since information and communication technologies require some physical infrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activ-ities in their national territory.90 \n\tFor example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecom-munications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the state.91The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control is thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such as cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facil-ities) are located in the area concerned.\nThe second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s territory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judg-ment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity completed in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.92In cyberspace, the principle is also\n87 Schmitt (n 27) 55 (Rule 9).\n88 ibid 2\u20133.\n89 S.S.

Therefore, the current tendency of state practice is to interpret territorial jurisdiction broadly, where any substantial connection between the cyber activity and state territory might serve as a sufficient basis for jurisdiction.94 \n\tRelated to an area outside the state\u2019s effective control, this type of jurisdiction might lead to various scenarios. Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is com-pleted in the area concerned95and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance. Under \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activ-ity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist fighters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the violation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even in another state.96 \n\tThe third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a juris-dictional link accepted to reflect customary international law:97where an activity does not emanate from or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain domestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace,98some scholars contest its applicability as it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of web-sites in all countries.99The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applic-ability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the state and the cyber activity than is applied in the offline world.100Accordingly, the territorial state will have jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the dif-fusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.\nIn other words, the territorial state has jurisdiction under general international law over cyber activities that constitute human rights violations that originate, occur or have an effect in the part\n93 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 22(1)(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) art 30(1)(a).\n94 Schmitt (n 27) 57; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Report of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression 2013 (31 December 2013), OEA/Ser.L/V/II.149, Doc 50, 496\u201397, para 66. 95 Schmitt (n 27) 56 para 5.\n96 Inter-American Judicial Committee (n 64) 164.\n97 Schmitt (n 27) 58.\n98 LICRA and UEJF v Yahoo!

The next section examines how the state exercises its\njurisdiction in cyberspace under IHRL, where the term \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 has an autonomous\nmeaning.\n4. THE STATE\u2019S JURISDICTION UNDER IHRL\nAs cyberspace is subject to the sovereignty of the state under the jurisdiction rules of general\ninternational law referred to above, it is logical to argue that the state is bound by IHRL in cyber-\nspace as it is bound in the offline context. Indeed, states101and international organisations102have\nrecognised that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, thus accepting\nthat IHRL applies equally to conduct in cyberspace.103While the state has obligations to respect\nand protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obliga-\ntions in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space,\nare not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above.\nIn other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in\nan area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far\nIHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical offline space in that area\nmust be clarified.\n\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international\nlaw: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the\nnexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power\nor authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.104Unlike juris-\ndiction in general international law \u2013 defined above as the competence of states to regulate in\naccordance with international law \u2013 jurisdiction in IHRL can be based on a factual situation.\nThis means that in exceptional circumstances jurisdiction can be extraterritorial, covering acts\n101 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 15(1); \u2018G8 Declaration Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy\u2019, G8 Summit of Deauville, 26\u201327 May 2011, para II/10, ; NETmundial, \u2018Multistakeholder Statement\u2019, Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, S\u00e3o Paulo, 24 April 2014, Part 1 \u2013 Internet Governance Principles: Human Rights and Shared Values, ; The White House, \u2018International Strategy for Cyberspace, Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World\u2019, May 2011, 5, .\n102 UNGA Res 68/167 (21 January 2014), UN Doc A/RES/68/167, para 3; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (18 July 2016), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/32/ 13, para 1; UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet (14 July 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/RES/26/13, para 1; GGE Report 2013 (n 69) para 21; GGE Report 2015 (n 69) para 26; CoE Committee of Ministers, Recommendation CM/Rec(2016)5[1] to Member States on Internet Freedom, 13 April 2016, para 1.\n103 UN World Summit on the Information Society (n 49) para 1; UN World Summit on the Information Society, Tunis Commitment (18 November 2005), Doc WSIS-05/TUNIS/DOC/7\u2013E, para 2; CoE Recommendation CM/Rec(2014)6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a Guide to Human Rights for Internet Users, 16 April 2014, para 5.1.\n104 De Schutter and others (n 79) 1102 para 3; Marko Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (Oxford University Press 2011) 39.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nand omissions of the state authorities performed or which produce effects outside their own ter-\nritory,105even without a lawful basis.106However, as a principal rule, international human rights\nconventions enshrine a primarily territorial notion of jurisdiction, which they apply within the\nstate party\u2019s national territory.107\nThe two types of jurisdiction in IHRL, extraterritorial and territorial, leads to the obligations\nof two states in the cyber context: first, one that effectively controls the territory (Section 4.1),\nand second, the territorial state (Section 4.2).\n4.1. THE JURISDICTION OF THE OUTSIDE STATE\nExtraterritorial jurisdiction under IHRL may have two alternative preconditions, based on effect-\niveness over persons (the personal model):108whether cyber activities by a state could give rise to\nthe personal model and, if they could, what is the required level of effectiveness over the person\nabroad?109For present purposes it suffices to note that physical control over foreign territory\nentails the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state.

The Court held that the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdic-tion may be limited in exceptional circumstances \u2018where a State is prevented from exercising its authority in part of its territory\u2019 as a result of military occupation by another state, \u2018acts of war or rebellion, or the acts of a foreign State supporting the installation of a separatist State within the territory of the State concerned\u2019.124The same circumstances prevent the territorial state from exer-cising its authority in the cyberspace as far as it loses control over the physical layers.\n\tThe ECtHR did not recognise that the presumption of jurisdiction could be rebutted, but held that it might be \u2018limited\u2019 in such an exceptional situation:125\nThose [positive] obligations [undertaken by the states parties under Article 1 of the Convention] remain even where the exercise of the State\u2019s authority is limited in part of its territory, so that it has a duty to take all the appropriate measures which it is still within its power to take.\nAnd:126\nThe Court considers that where a Contracting State is prevented from exercising its authority over the whole of its territory by a constraining de facto situation, such as obtains when a separatist regime is set up, whether or not this is accompanied by military occupation by another State, it does not thereby cease to have jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention over that part of its ter-ritory temporarily subject to a local authority sustained by rebel forces or by another State.\nIn other words, the presumption is irrebuttable, as the territorial state continues to have residual jurisdiction under IHRL. Therefore, the ECtHR held that unilateral declarations made by territor-ial states by which they intend to exclude the application of the European Convention on Human\n120 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (entered into force 27 January 1980) 1155 UNTS 331, art 29.

However, the Budapest Convention is complementary to and does not affect states parties\u2019 applicable multilateral or bilateral treaties,131including human rights treaties.132Therefore, the non-application of the Budapest Convention to areas outside the state\u2019s effective control does not affect the human rights obligations of the territorial state or the scope of its jurisdiction under IHRL.\nBeyond confirming the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction, the ECtHR also clarified the kind of positive obligations the territorial state has with regard to individuals in the area outside its effect-ive control. It held that the territorial state is required to take \u2018appropriate and sufficient\u2019 measures in order to guarantee the rights of individuals under the ECHR in an area outside its effective control.133The Court stated:134\n[S]uch a factual situation reduces the scope of that jurisdiction in that the undertaking given by the state under Article 1 must be considered by the Court only in the light of the Contracting State\u2019s positive obligations towards persons within its territory. The state in question must endeavour, with all the legal and diplomatic means available to it vis-\u00e0-vis foreign states and international organisations, to continue to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention.\nIn the case of human rights violations committed by de facto authorities in the area, the ECtHR will verify whether the territorial state has complied with a minimum threshold in the particular circumstances \u2013 \u2018to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made\u2019.135The territorial state\u2019s positive obligations relate both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction, and to\n127 ibid paras 20\u201321; Assanidze (n 2) para 140; ECtHR, Sargsyan v Azerbaijan, App no 40167/06, Admissibility, 14 December 2011, paras 64\u201365.\n128 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49).\n129 Reservations and Declarations for Treaty (n 50). \n130 ECHR (n 29) art 56.\n131 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 39. \n132 ibid art 15(1).\n133 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 334.\n134 ibid para 333.\n135 Ibid para 334.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nmeasures to ensure respect for the applicants\u2019 rights\u2019.136The obligation to re-establish control\nover the territory requires the territorial state, \u2018first, to refrain from supporting the separatist\nregime and, secondly, to act by taking all the political, judicial and other measures at its disposal\nfor re-establishing control over that territory\u2019.137\nThe second aspect of the territorial state\u2019s positive obligation to ensure respect for individ-\nuals\u2019 rights includes \u2018the diplomatic, economic, judicial or other measures that it is in its\npower to take and are in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights\nguaranteed by the Convention\u2019.138The availability of those measures is context-dependent and\nmonitoring bodies will examine their use on a case-by-case basis.\nIn the Ilas\u00e7u judgment of the ECtHR six dissenting judges opposed the jurisdiction of Moldova,\nholding that there was no evidence of the state\u2019s direct or indirect authority over, or acquiescence in\nthe commission of the human rights violations in Transnistria.139Similarly, some commentators con-\nsider the judgment to be too strict with regard to Moldova.140However, subsequent case law shows\nunanimity or an overwhelming majority in the judgments regarding Moldova\u2019s responsibility.141\nIt seems that the ECtHR did not set the threshold too high, considering that the judgment cited\nseveral concrete examples where the measures taken by the Moldovan government produced real\neffects on the lives of individuals in Transnistria in general, or the applicants in particular.142The\nmeasures taken by the territorial state that the Court accepted as complying with its positive\nobligations consisted, for instance, of diplomatic acts such as protests or negotiation,143non-\nrecognition of the illegal situation,144investigative or judicial measures operated in the\ngovernment-controlled area,145provision of certain socio-economic benefits for individuals in\n136 ibid para 339; ECtHR.

Therefore, the relation between the due diligence standard and positive obligations in IHRL is that of the general and the special. The standard is especially applicable to a state having lost its territorial control, as it guarantees flexibility in assessing its particular situation. The state incurs responsibility for failing to comply with due diligence only under two cumula-tive conditions: (i) it had the means to prevent or to repress the human rights violation; and (ii) it knew or should have known about the risk of the violation.154The first condition \u2013 known also as the \u2018capacity to influence\u2019 effectively the actions of private actors155\u2013 assesses the actual means in the state\u2019s power to take legal, administrative, diplomatic and other measures to protect human rights. This means that the jurisdiction of the territorial state, while based mainly on sovereignty, still depends on effectiveness as far as the latter determines the scope of the state\u2019s obligations. Accordingly, the state is required to take all those steps it reasonably could within its effective power in the particular situation. According to the second condition, the state is responsible only if the human rights violation actually occurred and if the state was aware of, or should\n146 Catan (n 136) para 147; ECtHR Vardanean v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 22200/10, 30 May 2017, para 42.\n147 Ivan\u0163oc (n 143) para 109; Vardanean, ibid para 42.\n148 Island of Palmas Case (n 80) 839.\n149 Trail Smelter Case (US, Canada) (1938, 1941) III UNRIAA 1965; in the same sense Corfu Channel Case (UK v Albania) (Merits) [1949] ICJ Rep 4, 22.\n150 Corfu Channel case, ibid 18.\n151 Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay) (Merits) [2010] ICJ Rep 14, 55\u201356 [101]. 152 Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22; Timo Koivurova, \u2018Due Diligence\u2019, (2010) MPEPIL, para 2.\n153 Case of Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez v Honduras (Merits) (1988) Inter-Am CtHR, Judgment of 29 July 1988, (Ser C) No 4, [172].\n154 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro) (Merits) [2007] ICJ Rep 43, [430]\u2013[431].\n155 ibid [430].\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nnormally have learned of the risk of the violation.156In respect of areas outside the effective con-\ntrol of the state, actual knowledge and available means is to be assessed to establish whether the\nterritorial state complied with its due diligence \u2013 as is the practice of the ECtHR in its case law.\nIt could be argued that the threshold set by the ECtHR in separatist areas is too demanding,\nbinding only on states parties to the ECHR, a regional treaty enshrining one of the highest stan-\ndards. However, UN Charter-based human rights bodies157and universal treaty monitoring bod-\nies158have reiterated the same standard and addressed various positive obligations with regard to\nindividuals in areas outside government control in their concluding observations on territorial\nstates.159While the ECtHR has based this case law on the necessity to cover the European\n\u2018legal space\u2019 by the effective application of the ECHR160and to eliminate \u2018vacuums\u2019 at the\nregional level,161UN treaty monitoring bodies seek to ensure the universality of human rights\nwith the same practice. The irrebuttable presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction in\nIHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights treaties (the\n\u2018legal space\u2019 and elimination of the vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal\nlevel), but also with the concept of the \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 of the territorial state.162It is\nperhaps too early to speak of an established customary norm,163but at least international\nhuman rights treaties are interpreted in accordance with the above mentioned practice.164\nThe obligation not to allow the state\u2019s territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of\nother states or individuals binds the state in every activity performed in its territory, including\n156 ibid [431]; Corfu Channel Case (n 149) 22 (\u2018the laying of the minefield which caused the explosions on October 22nd, 1946, could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of the Albanian Government\u2019). 157 Human Rights Council (n 115) para 41; Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, \u2018Mission to the Republic of Moldova\u2019 (12 February 2009), UN Doc A/HRC/10/44/ Add.3, para 6.\n158 The Human Rights Committee has recently elaborated a general comment, providing that \u2018a State party has an obligation to respect and to ensure the rights under article 6 of all persons who are within its territory and all persons subject to its jurisdiction\u2019.

It equally fails to integrate the due diligence standard in IHRL \u2013 this would conceptualise the obli-gation to protect167and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes of international law applicable to cyber operations. The reason for these omissions is the focus of the Manual on customary rather than conventional IHRL.168However, given the almost universal ratification of the various UN human rights treaties and the wide ratification of regional human rights treaties, their convergent treaty practice should be taken into account. As explained in the next section, due diligence and the specific positive obligations it leads to in IHRL \u2013 namely, within the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over human rights violations committed in the area out-side its effective control \u2013 apply equally in cyberspace.\n5. THE APPLICATION OF IHRL BY THE TERRITORIAL STATE IN CYBERSPACE\nCertain states have declared their readiness to apply to cyberspace the existing norms of inter-national law, without the need to reinvent a new special branch of international law.169This sug-gests that IHRL is adaptable to new phenomena like cyberspace with its existing normative framework.170Because of the horizontal protection they impose against violations by third par-ties, the due diligence standard and the corresponding positive obligations of the territorial state in IHRL are likely to be adaptable to the online context. Human rights monitoring bodies have recognised that where a state exercises its jurisdiction in the sense of general international law (Section 3) \u2013 that is, its regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service pro-viders in its territory \u2013 the same state is bound by its international human rights obligations.171 However, they did not specify what the applicable norms are when the state has no effective con-trol over part of its territory.\nIf the case law of IHRL on the jurisdiction of the territorial state is applied to the cyberspace, it appears that the presumption of its jurisdiction and its positive obligations apply fully in the online context, even in the absence of effective control over the physical infrastructure. As men-tioned above, the ECtHR applies a two-step approach to examine whether the territorial state has complied with its positive obligations: its positive obligations relate both to the measures needed to re-establish its control over its territory \u2018as an expression of its jurisdiction\u2019 (Section 5.2), \u2018and\n165 Karine Bannelier and Theodore Christakis, \u2018Cyber-Attacks \u2013 Prevention-Reactions: The Role of States and Private Actors\u2019, Social Science Research Network 2017, SSRN Scholarly Paper ID 2941988 18, ; Schmitt (n 27) 30\u201343.\n166 Schmitt (n 27) 184\u201387, 198.\n167 ibid 197\u2013201.\n168 ibid 179\u201380.\n169 The White House (n 101) 9; AALCO (n 68) para 12 (Malaysia).\n170 Kubo Ma\u010d\u00e1k, \u2018From Cyber Norms to Cyber Rules: Re-Engaging States as Law-Makers\u2019 (2017) 30 Leiden Journal of International Law 877, 886.\n171 UNGA, Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age (30 June 2014), UN Doc A/HRC/27/37, para 34; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34: Article19: Freedom of Opinions and Expression (12 September 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/GC/34, para 39; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur (n 91) para 41.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nto measures to ensure respect for the individual applicants\u2019 rights\u2019172(Section 5.3). Before exam-ining how these positive obligations apply in cyberspace, the article will explain that, despite the focus of the ECtHR on positive duties, the territorial state is bound equally by negative obliga-tions under IHRL in cyberspace (Section 5.1). As this section will clarify, universal human rights monitoring bodies also share the territorial state\u2019s negative and positive obligations.\n5.1. NEGATIVE OBLIGATIONS\nThe emphasis of the ECtHR on positive obligations certainly does not disregard the fact that the territorial state continues to be bound by negative duties. Such duties are understood as the state\u2019s obligation not to violate human rights in an area outside its territorial control. Negative obliga-tions continue to impose on the territorial state, for example, the duty not to violate the right to life of individuals by cyber attacks, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment through online means,173and prohibitions on freedom of expression, including incitement to racial hatred174or to terrorism.175In this regard, there is no difference between government-controlled areas and those not under government control: negative obligations bind the territorial state in both contexts.\nAs mentioned above, territorial states have often had recourse to blocking or filtering commu-nications on the internet, invoking protection of their national security.176A first possible legal basis for such measures is the derogation allowed by certain human rights treaties in a state of emergency. Under such a derogation, a state may suspend provisionally the application of one or more human rights, to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation at a time of sufficiently grave crisis that threatens the life of the nation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.177While the territorial state may derogate in respect of certain human rights, such as freedom of expression, it cannot limit\n172 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339; Catan (n 136) para 145; Mozer (n 136) para 151.\n173 Cyber threats might cause mental suffering of such severity that would violate the prohibition of torture, or inhuman or degrading treatment: ECtHR G\u00e4fgen v Germany, App no 22978/05, 1 June 2010, para 108; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 20: Article 7 (27 May 2008), UN Doc HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9 (Vol I), 200\u201302 para 5.\n174 CERD (n 30) art 4; ICCPR (n 29) art 20; CERD, General Recommendation No 35: Combating Racist Hate Speech (26 September 2013), UN Doc CERD/C/GC/35.\n175 UNSC Res 2253 (17 December 2015), UN Doc S/RES/2253 (2015), para 22; UNGA, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression (10 August 2011), UN Doc A/66/290, para 81.\n176 eg, the Ukrainian presidential decree of 16 May 2017 targeted \u2018legal entities of the Russian Federation, the activity of which threatens information and cyber security of Ukraine\u2019: see Human Rights Committee (n 6) para 95, n 103.\n177 ECHR (n 29) art 15(1); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(1); American Convention on Human Rights (entered into force 18 July 1978) 1144 UNTS 143 (ACHR), art 27(1); Arab Charter on Human Rights (entered into force 15 March 2008), (2005) 12 International Human Rights Reports 893, art 4(b).\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nthe application of non-derogable rights,178nor the totality of human rights affected by the loss of\neffective control, and it should regularly review the derogation.179\nSecond, even beyond emergency situations, international human rights treaties permit the\nlawful restriction of freedom of expression, if prescribed by law and to the extent necessary to\nensure national security, territorial integrity, the protection of the rights of others or the preven-\ntion of disorder or crime.180The protection of the existence of the nation, its territorial integrity\nand political independence against the use of or threat of force might justify the invocation of\nnational security,181provided that the conventional limits of restricting freedom of expression\nare respected. As the Human Rights Committee held:182\nAny restrictions on the operation of websites, blogs or any other internet-based, electronic or other such\ninformation dissemination system, including systems to support such communication, such as internet\nservice providers or search engines, are only permissible to the extent that they are compatible with\nparagraph 3 [of Article 19 of the ICCPR on freedom of expression].\nFurthermore, \u2018[p]ermissible restrictions generally should be content-specific; generic bans on the\noperation of certain sites and systems are not compatible with paragraph 3\u2019.183Human rights\ntreaty bodies allow national authorities to restrict a given communication only in proportion to\nthe nature and extent of its perceived threat to national security or other protected interests.184\nIn other words, states parties have a negative obligation not to interfere with freedom of expres-\nsion, unless the restriction is prescribed by law, made in the interests of the admitted legitimate\npurposes, and satisfies the necessity and proportionality test. The same three-part test applies in\nsituations of armed conflict where international humanitarian law applies simultaneously.185\n178 ECHR (n 29) art 15(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 4(2) and Second Optional Protocol (entered into force 11 July 1991) 999 UNTS 414, art 6; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29: States of Emergency (Article 4) (31 August 2001), UN Doc CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, paras 8, 13, 15; ACHR, ibid arts 4(c), 27(2). 179 ECHR (n 29) art 15(3); ECtHR, Brannigan and McBride v United Kingdom, App nos 14553/89 and 14554/89, 23 May 1993, para 54; ICCPR (n 29) art 4(3); ACHR (n 177) art 27(3); Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 29, ibid para 4.\n180 ECHR (n 29) art 10(2); ICCPR (n 29) art 19(3)(b); ACHR (n 177) art 13(2)(b); a contrario, see, without any express limitation, African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, art 9 (for the implied limitations, see below n 184). 181 \u2018The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Symposium: Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Principles\u2019 (1985) 7 Human Rights Quarterly 3, 6 para 29.\n182 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43.\n183 ibid.\n184 Human Rights Committee, Keun-Tae Kim v Republic of Korea, Communication No 574/1994, views of 4 January 1999, UN Doc CCPR/C/64/D/574/1994, paras 12.4\u201312.5; and Jong-Kyu Sohn v Republic of Korea, Communication No 518/1992, 3 August 1995, UN Doc CCPR/C/54/D/518/1992, para 10.4; ECtHR, Jankovskis v Lithuania, App no 21575/08, 17 January 2017, paras 61\u201363; ECtHR, Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey, App no 3111/10, 18 December 2012, para 66 and concurring opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque; AfrCtHPR, Ingabire Victoire Umuhoza v Republic of Rwanda, App no 003/2014, Judgment of 24 November 2017, [161]\u2013[162].\n185 OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and Responses to Conflict Situations (4 May 2015), UN/OSCE/OAS/ACHPR, para 2(c), .\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nUnqualified and broadly defined monitoring of the content of internet communications, such as nationwide filtering measures, is likely to be considered an unlawful restriction of freedom of expression and the right of access to information.186The a posteriori (after publication) blocking or filtering of clearly specified unlawful content can be considered lawful, however, to protect the rights and interests of others and of society as a whole if the above-mentioned conditions of per-mitted restrictions are satisfied, even without notice from the alleged victims or from third parties.187\n5.2. MEASURES INTENDED TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTROL OVER TERRITORY/CYBERSPACE\nAs mentioned above, the territorial state is required to take all political, judicial and other mea-sures at its disposal for re-establishing control over its territory. Such measures serve as mere expression of its jurisdiction over areas not under government control,188irrespective of the inef-fectiveness of those measures: the ECtHR has also recognised that there might be little that the territorial state could do to re-establish its authority over the area.189Such measures could be considered to be \u2018pure political rhetoric\u2019190or the mere expression of the state\u2019s desire to re-establish its territorial control, which is incapable of being subjected to judicial review.191 While it is indeed difficult to derive such an obligation from IHRL which protects individuals rather than state sovereignty, it can be seen as part of the due diligence standard. The latter standard, that of the \u2018diligens paterfamilias\u2019,192would expect any reasonable, civilised govern-ment, as a minimum, to refrain from acquiescing in the wrongful acts,193and to reassert its responsibility for its national territory and its residents.\nThe expected measures may consist of asserting sovereignty over the area \u2018both internally and internationally\u2019; criminal proceedings against certain leaders of the de facto authorities; diplo-matic negotiations; or certain forms of cooperation with the de facto authorities with a view to normalising the everyday lives of the people living in the area.194The measures to re-establish control over territory apply to the online context as far as control over cyberspace and extending access to the internet ensure a greater likelihood of human rights protection by the territorial\n186 Ahmet Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m v Turkey (n 184) paras 66\u201369; ECtHR, Szab\u00f3 and Vissy v Hungary, App no 37138/14, 12 January 2016, paras 62\u201389; Case C-70/10 Scarlet Extended SA v Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge des auteurs [2011] ECR\n(29 November 2011), UN Doc CCPR/C/IRN/CO/3, para 27; Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations: Turkmenistan (19 April 2012), UN Doc CCPR/C/TKM/CO/1, para 18.\n187 ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, paras 153, 159.\n188 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 339.\n189 ibid para 341.\n190 Ganna Yudkivska, \u2018Territorial Jurisdiction and Positive Obligations of an Occupied State: Some Reflections on Evolving Issues under Article 1 of the European Convention\u2019 in Van Aaken and Motoc (n 7) 136, 143. 191 Marko Milanovic and Tatjana Papic\u0301, \u2018The Applicability of the ECHR in Contested Territories\u2019 (2018) 67 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 779, 796.\n192 Negrete case, cited in John Bassett Moore, A Digest of International Law (Goverment Printing Office 1906) 962.\n193 DRC v Uganda (n 81) [300], and Declaration of Judge Tomka, [2]\u2013[3].\n194 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) paras 341\u201345.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nstate.195The internet is a channel through which the state can fulfil human rights, such as the\nright to education, the right to vote and the right to an effective remedy for citizens from the\narea outside the state\u2019s effective control.196Therefore, measures that aim to re-establish \u2018internet\nsovereignty\u2019 are likely to satisfy the requirements of the ECtHR. For instance, diplomatic pro-\ntests against the ongoing violation of the state\u2019s sovereignty over cyberspace in the area,197the\nexpression of an intention to re-establish its control in a treaty declaration on the Budapest\nConvention on Cybercrime,198cooperation with the de facto authorities to restore telecommuni-\ncation links,199or the restoration of a transmission tower in the neighbourhood of the area not\nunder government control200are likely to constitute measures intended to re-establish control\nover sovereignty/cyberspace.\nAs a general rule, the state has a discretion to choose the measures to re-establish control that\nit deems the most appropriate. However, it is problematic if the state restricts internet/telecommu-\nnications for an extended period in order to re-assert control over its territory, while the same\nmeasures violate individuals\u2019 human rights and thus run against the third type of obligation\n(below). For instance, in the context of the Iraqi fight against online propaganda and terrorist\nrecruitment by ISIL, the Iraqi government ordered internet service providers to shut down the\ninternet in the five provinces under ISIL control in June 2014.201In fact, the measures aimed\nto re-establish control over territory/cyberspace should be taken within the limits defined by inter-\nnational law202in general, and IHRL in particular. The three-part test referred to above deter-\nmines the lawful restriction of qualified human rights, especially freedom of expression.

MEASURES INTENDED TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS\u2019 RIGHTS\nWhile cyberspace is considered largely as embodying freedom of internet communication, the free flow of information and respect for the right to freedom of opinion and expression,205entail-ing mainly negative obligations on the part of the state, does not exclude positive obligations to protect individuals against human rights violations by third parties. In recent years, human rights treaty monitoring bodies have clarified various positive obligations that states have in cyberspace.206 \n\tAs mentioned above, in areas outside the effective control of the state special measures with the aim of protecting the rights of individuals include positive duties \u2018to take the diplomatic, eco-nomic, judicial or other measures that were both in its power to take and in accordance with inter-national law\u2019.207As a translation of the due diligence standard, the anticipated measures depend on the context and must be reasonable \u2013 commensurate with the territorial state\u2019s limited ability to protect human rights in an area outside its effective control.208In the face of online human rights violations, the most relevant measures are providing remedies (5.3.1) and preventive mea-sures (5.3.2).\n5.3.1. PROVIDING REMEDIES\nAs the territorial state does not have physical access to the elements of the breach (the victim, the perpetrator or the ICT infrastructure) situated in the area, its judicial and investigative authorities are limited to the area under the control of the government. Its obligation to provide remedies should consist of enabling the victim to inform the state authorities \u2018of the details of his situation and to be kept informed of the various legal and diplomatic actions taken\u2019.209It may be possible to enable individuals to seek a remedy remotely, such as by allowing files to be sent\n203 CERD, Concluding Observations: Germany (30 June 2015), UN Doc CERD/C/DEU/CO/19\u201322, para 9(c). 204 Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 43; Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression\u2019(30 March 2017), UN Doc A/HRC/35/22, paras 8\u201316; OSCE, Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and the Internet, 1 June 2011, para 6(b), .\n205 Iginio Gagliardone and others, Countering Online Hate Speech (UNESCO 2015) 5; ECtHR, KU v Finland, App no 2872/02, 2 December 2008, para 49 (recognising freedom of expression and confidentiality of commu-nications for users of telecommunications and internet services as \u2018primary considerations\u2019 on the one hand, and the state\u2019s positive obligations to reconcile the various human rights which compete for protection in the cyberspace on the other).\n206 eg, ECtHR, KU v Finland, ibid paras 46\u201349; ECtHR, F\u00e9ret v Belgium, App no 15615/07, 16 July 2009, paras 72\u201373, 78; ECtHR, Delfi AS v Estonia [GC], App no 64569/09, 16 June 2015, para 159; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No 34 (n 171) para 15.\n207 Ilas\u0327cu (n 123) para 340; Catan (n 136) paras 109\u2013110; Mozer (n 136) paras 99\u2013100.\n208 Mozer (n 136) para 216.\n209 ibid para 214.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nelectronically, providing information about remedies and communicating via Skype or email with\ncitizens from the area outside its effective control.210Similarly, universal treaty bodies have\nrecommended that states guarantee access to toll-free helplines for victims in all regions within\ntheir territory.211Another way of complying with the obligation to provide a remedy is to create,\nin the government-controlled territory, \u2018a set of judicial, investigative and civil service authorities\nwhich work in parallel\u2019 with those created by the de facto authorities.212While the effects of any\ndecisions taken by these authorities can be felt only outside the conflict area, they have the func-\ntion of enabling cases to be brought in the proper manner before the territorial state\u2019s authorities,\n\u2018which can then initiate diplomatic and legal steps to attempt to intervene in specific cases\u2019.213\nThe territorial state is required to undertake to investigate cybercrimes committed in the area\noutside its effective control.214Even though denied access to the area, the territorial state should\ninitiate all investigative procedures commensurate with its limited ability,215for instance, by\nkeeping thorough documentation on the victims of human rights violations.216The absence of\nterritorial control and access to evidence on the spot is in itself a less important obstacle in\nthe case of cyber activities than in the case of offline human rights violations, because the former\ncan be investigated from remote places. As a first channel, the authorities of the territorial state\ncan monitor publicly available (open source) stored computer data.217A second method of inves-\ntigation is through mutual legal assistance requested from a third state where information tech-\nnology storing relevant data is located.218However, states hosting the largest cyber service\nproviders like the United Kingdom or the United States rarely allow the sharing of digital evi-\ndence and might impose restrictions on companies sharing content data with foreign\n210 For some good practices of Ukrainian relocated courts see OSCE (n 196); Mozer (n 136) para 214. 211 CRC, Concluding Observations: Georgia (9 March 2017), UN Doc CRC/C/GEO/CO/4, para 24(e); CEDAW, Concluding Observations: Azerbaijan (12 March 2015), UN Doc CEDAW/C/AZE/CO/5, para 23(d). 212 Mozer (n 136) para 215.\n213 ibid.\n214 In the same sense see certain NGOs: Promo-LEX, \u2018Resolution on Ensuring and Guaranteeing Free and Secure Internet Access to all Citizens of the Republic of Moldova, including the Transnistrian Region\u2019, 2016, .\n215 eg, Mozer (n 136) paras 215\u201316; ECtHR, Draci v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 5349/02, 17 October 2017, para 61; ECtHR, Stomatii v Republic of Moldova and Russia, App no 69528/10, 18 September 2018, paras 71\u201372.\n216 In their non-binding concluding observations, the treaty bodies have interpreted the duty to investigate violations of physical integrity (torture, enforced disappearance) in this sense: eg, CAT, Concluding Observations: Ukraine (n 159) para 11(a); CAT, Concluding Observations: Iraq (7 September 2015), UN Doc CAT/C/IRQ/CO/1, para 12(b) (victims of inhuman treatment); Committee on Enforced Disappearances, Concluding Observations: Iraq (13 October 2015), UN Doc CED/C/IRQ/CO/1, para 23.\n217 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) art 32(a); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) art 40(1).\n218 eg, Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (n 49) arts 29(1), 31(1), 33(1); Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences (n 70) arts 37, 39, 41.

For less serious online human rights violations, one can argue that the territorial state\nshould consider seeking cooperation with the de facto authorities.234The choice of the concrete\nforms of investigation depends on the context, but the state should use all available lawful means.\nGiven that these measures originate from the due diligence standard, under this standard the\nrequired degree of diligence depends upon the actual control the territorial state has over cyber-\nspace, its available resources, its capacity to influence the perpetrator effectively and the gravity\nof the harm.235In the cyber context, this means that during an ongoing armed conflict with grave\nhuman rights violations offline, while a territorial state like Ukraine might not have the capability\nto investigate an alleged hacking of e-mail in Eastern Ukraine, it should focus on serious and\nlarge-scale human rights violations, such as racial hatred, through the internet.236Likewise,\nwhen the Iraqi authorities have to allocate their limited investigative capacity among various\nmajor human rights violations, it is legitimate that they focus on the online sale of girls237as\nthat relates to ongoing violations of the victims\u2019 physical integrity to the detriment of less serious\nbreaches of media freedom.\n5.3.2. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\nIt has been queried whether states have a customary international law obligation to prevent\nwrongful acts in the cyber context.238The majority of experts are of the view that the due dili-\ngence standard does not impose on states a general obligation of prevention before the cyber\nactivity generates serious adverse effects, but expects the state to stop ongoing wrongful acts\n232 ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [Chamber], App no 36925/07, 4 April 2017, paras 291, 293\u201396; ECtHR, G\u00fczelyurtlu and Others v Cyprus and Turkey [GC], App no 36925/07, 29 January 2019, paras 237\u201338, 241\u201357. The difference between the rulings of the Chamber and the Grand Chamber is the extent to which the state is expected to take reasonable steps to cooperate. Contrary to the Chamber, the Grand Chamber held that supplying the whole investigation file to the de facto authorities would be unreasonable, as it \u2018would amount in substance to a transfer of the criminal case by Cyprus to the \u201cTRNC\u201d courts, and Cyprus would thereby be waiv-ing its criminal jurisdiction\u2019 over the crime: ibid para 253; a contrario, considering the majority judgment as the rejection of the territorial state\u2019s procedural obligation to cooperate with the TRNC, see the partly dissenting opin-ion of Judges Karakas\u0327 and Pejchal, para 11.\n233 G\u00fczelyurtlu [Chamber], ibid para 238 (Republic of Cyprus) and partly dissenting opinion of Judge Serghides, para 47(h), (o); G\u00fczelyurtlu [GC], ibid paras 207\u201308 (Republic of Cyprus).\n234 CEDAW, Concluding Observations: Georgia (24 July 2014), UN Doc CEDAW/C/GEO/CO/4-5, para 13; Olga Demian, \u2018Strengthening the Respect for Human Rights in the Implementation of the Republic of Moldova\u2019s Digital Agenda, Report on Human Rights Protection on the Internet\u2019, CoE Consultant, December 2015, para 7.1.12, , 67.\n235 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v USA), Merits, Judgment, [1986] ICJ Rep 14, 85 [157]; Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) 221 [430].\n236 CERD, Concluding Observations: Ukraine (4 October 2016), UN Doc CERD/C/UKR/CO/22-23, para 12. 237 CRC, Concluding Observations: Iraq (n 159) para 19(b); on online slave auctions by ISIL, see Human Rights Council (n 58) paras 57, 118.\n238 In favour of such an existing customary norm, Sklerov (n 18) 71; in favour of an \u2018emerging norm\u2019, Erik Talbot Jensen, \u2018Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead\u2019 (2015) 50 Texas International Law Journal 275, 299; Bannelier-Christakis (n 18) 32\u201336.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at . \nin cyberspace.239IHRL, however, enshrines special duties of prevention that are not limited to the duty to react to and repress ongoing human rights violations in cyberspace, but expects effective measures to prevent violations by third parties if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such abuse will occur.240 \n\tHuman rights monitoring bodies have interpreted various treaty provisions as requiring pre-ventive measures to combat online human rights violations in ordinary situations of governmental control over territory. Their recommendations include, for example, that states parties regularly monitor and prevent incidences of (cyber-)bullying;241identify internet service providers with a view to preventing the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography;242collaborate with the media and the ICT industry to enforce global standards for child protection;243establish\u2018effective mechanisms for identifying potential future threats of terrorist attacks before they have materialized\u2019 through the gathering and analysis of relevant information by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.244The general rule is that the territorial state is required to take all mea-sures within its power as far as their effects might affect areas that are not under government control.\n\tFurthermore, online human rights violations should be prevented by regulatory means,245for example, by criminal legislation adopted in the government-controlled area that extends its regu-latory scope to the entire territory.246The rationale is the preventive effect of the law, even if it is enforceable in the government-controlled area only. For example, the customary international law duty on the part of states to prohibit and prosecute the online recruitment of children, at least under 15 years, into armed forces or armed groups applies to the entire territory.247 \n\tA state can always regulate internet service providers or online media companies based in the government-controlled area.

This would be effective as far as those companies provide services in the area outside the government\u2019s control. For instance, the Iraqi government could regulate the conduct of those ISPs in the ISIL-controlled areas that were based in the government-controlled territory. As Baghdad does not have centralised control over the country\u2019s telecommu-nications infrastructure, such regulatory measures could not prevent terrorist communication using the service of ISPs based in Turkey and Iran.249With regard to those private actors, due diligence would expect Iraq to use all available means, such as requesting legal assistance from its neighbours, even if its efforts are unsuccessful.250In the case of belligerent occupation, however, where the territorial state no longer has de facto regulatory power over ISPs, preventive measures might be limited to diplomatic protests and the seizure of international human rights control mechanisms.251 \n\tWhile preventing certain online human rights violations, the state should ensure a balance between the limitations of the various human rights. In the case of restricting online content to prevent racial hatred, freedom of expression may be restricted only by applying the three-point test. In the example referred to above of shutting down the internet in five Iraqi provinces under ISIL control, a lawful preventive measure could have involved ordering Iraqi internet service pro-viders to disrupt the use of specific websites and social media by those associated with extremist groups for delivering propaganda and recruiting foreign terrorist fighters.252 \n\tWhile the above measures are not exhaustive, human rights control bodies will verify whether a minimum effort was taken by the territorial state to protect human rights online.253The thresh-old of the positive obligations described above, in accordance with due diligence, depends on the actual knowledge and the available means of the territorial state to prevent and mitigate the com-mission of wrongful acts by third parties. If the state is not aware of the online human rights vio-lations committed against a victim in the area outside its control, it cannot be expected to take positive measures to protect the victim.254 \n\tThe greater the capacity that the state has to comply with its due diligence, the higher is the standard of action required in the particular case.

Feasibility depends, among others, \u2018on the technical wherewithal of the state concerned, the intellectual and financial resources at its disposal, the state\u2019s institutional capacity to take measures, and the extent of its control over cyber infrastructure\u2019 located in the government-controlled territory.255 \n\tThis capacity is to a large extent technical, often referred to as \u2018virtual power\u2019256or \u2018virtual control\u2019, understood as the \u2018ability to intercept, store, analyse and use communications\u2019.257Since governments might have very different relationships with the internet and telecommunications companies that could facilitate surveillance, their capacity to access directly the undersea cables and other carriers of internet and telephonic communications might be different. However, \u2018vir-tual power\u2019 or \u2018virtual control\u2019 is not the only factor that determines the capacity of the territorial state to comply with its due diligence. Even if the state is not a developed state with modern tech-nical infrastructure, it might still have legislative or diplomatic means, for example, to exert pres-sure on the perpetrators to cease the violation or to prosecute them. Many of the above-mentioned preventive, regulatory, investigative and redress measures can be taken in the government-controlled areas and this fact relativises the importance of the lack of territorial control over the area.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe lack of control of the territorial state over the physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace on the other. Notwithstanding the absence of its effective territorial control, the state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the ter-ritory and the cyberspace. The consequence of sovereignty in IHRL is the presumed jurisdiction of the territorial state. The irrebuttable presumption of the state\u2019s jurisdiction over its entire ter-ritory in IHRL is in conformity not only with the object and the purpose of human rights con-ventions (the \u2018legal space\u2019 and the elimination of vacuums at the regional level, universality at the universal level), but also with the concept of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019. In accordance with the latter theory, it is the primary responsibility of the territorial state to guarantee human rights in its territory.\n255 Schmitt (n 27) 47 para 16; in general international law, see the same factors reiterated in Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (n 154) [430]; US Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment [1980] ICJ Rep 3, 31\u201333 [63]\u2013[68]; DRC v Uganda (n 81) 268 [301].\n256 Eliza Watt, \u2018The Role of International Human Rights Law in the Protection of Online Privacy in the Age of Surveillance\u2019 in H R\u00f5igas and others (eds), 2017 9th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Defending the Core (NATO CCD COE Publication 2017) 102.\n257 ibid 103.

The territorial state is obliged to use its investigative and judicial capabilities, legislate and regulate non-state actors in the entire national territory, and seek international cooperation in reacting to online human rights violations.\nAs a result of technological progress, the presumption of the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction is a fortiori applicable to cyberspace where the state can ensure the re-establishment of its control over human rights violations, even in the absence of territorial control. Given that most territorial states retain some information and telecommunications infrastructures in their government-controlled area, applying the so-called due diligence standard to human rights in cyberspace in areas outside the effective control of the territorial state is feasible. Consequently, national legislation, cyber security strategies, military manuals and doctrinal commentaries like the Tallinn Manual258should expressly recognise that the state is presumed to have jurisdiction under IHRL over its entire territory, even in the absence of effective control over it.\nA revised Tallinn Manual should integrate the due diligence standard in its chapter on IHRL with a view to conceptualising the obligation to protect259and establish systemic integration between the general and the special regimes applicable to cyber operations. More generally, it should further take into account the obligations flowing from international human rights treaties, especially those applied universally.\n258 Schmitt (n 27) 182\u201384 (rule 34 \u2013 Applicability). \n259 ibid 197\u2013201.\nDownloade.  14:29:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at .

Recent scholarship demonstrates that the covert nature of cyber intrusions allows states to respond with restraint, avoiding escalation. But what happens when cyber intrusions become public and are highly visible? This article examines the rhetorical strategies employed by authoritarian Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs associated with a public cyber intrusion. Drawing on the conceptual language of image-repair and crisis communication theories and employing discourse analysis of original data in Arabic, we identify three types of face-saving strategies: diminishing, self-complimenting, and accusing. Our findings indicate that intrusions involving leaking or faking information bring about unique \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies that do not only deal with the intrusion itself but also with the subsequent information crisis. Overall, the article identifies how states employ diverse rhetorical strategies\u2014beyond attribution\u2014to narrate cyber intrusions and keep cyber conflict contained.\nKEYWORDS Cybersecurity; Middle East; constructivism; image; discourse analysis\nIn July 2017, nearly two months after Qatar had suffered a cyber intrusion,\nthe Qatari Ministry of Interior (MOI) held a press conference to reveal evi-\ndence concerning the intrusion. Rather than only providing technical details,\nthe MOI broadcasted a dramatic video with intense music, thrilling graphics,\nand a spy-style vibe to reveal the intrusion step-by-step (Qatar MOI, 2017).\nIn addition to delegitimizing cyber intrusions as acts of terrorism, the video\nemphasized the Qatari remarkable success in containing the intrusion and\ndetecting its source despite the intrusion\u2019s sophistication.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The terms on which this article has been published allow the posting of the Accepted Manuscript in a repository by the author(s) or with their consent.\nThe Qatari press conference is not unique. When cyber intrusions become public knowledge, states do not only engage in technical strategies to block the intrusion and identify the initiator, but also manage their public relations\u2014they publish messages, hold press conferences, brief reporters, and rhetori-cally try to manage this crisis. These performative, social, and symbolic strat-egies are often left unnoticed in existing research on cyber discourse. While extant studies examine different elements in the discursive construction of cyberspace, threats, and responses (e.g., Branch, 2019; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2017), we know less about the narration of cyber intrusions after they had happened. Of course, many studies zoom-in on the discourse of attribution or credit-claiming by the initiators (e.g., Brown & Fazal, 2021; Egloff, 2020a, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a; Poznansky & Perkoski, 2018), but as this article demonstrates, there is much more going on discursively following cyber intrusions.\n\tThis article explores the rhetorical strategies used by governments in response to a public cyber intrusion they suffered. In addition to obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted, protecting intelligence sources or technical capabilities, and identifying the initiator, we suggest that states employ rhetori-cal strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect their public image in front of domestic, regional, or international audiences. Drawing on two scholarly traditions\u2014the sociology of accounts and apologies (Benoit, 2014; Schlenker, 1980; Scott & Lyman, 1968) and self-presentation theories (Goffman, 1959)\u2014the article maps and categorizes the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf countries to narrate the public cyber intrusion and manage their public impression. We do so via an original discourse analysis of official statements and state-spon-sored media reports in five cyber intrusions that differ in their targets and methods: Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to cyber intrusion against its oil company Aramco (\u201cShamoon,\u201d August 2012), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusion (May-June 2015), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to intrusions using \u201cShamoon 2.0\u201d malware (November 2016-January 2017), Qatar\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-fake\u201d intrusion (May 2017), and Bahrain\u2019s response to multiple hacking operations (July-August 2019).1 \n\tExamining the strategies used by these states to \u201csave face\u201d is important for two reasons. Empirically, these strategies are a crucial stepping-stone to understanding the restraint and the limited nature of cyber conflicts. Existing International Relations (IR) scholarship focuses on the operational aspects of offensive cyber operations (OCOs), showing that targeted states practice restraint in their response to cyber intrusions, and that escalation is not a common practice (Fischerkeller et al., 2022, pp. 130\u2013141; Gartzke, 2013; Jacobsen, 2021; Kaminska, 2021; Lindsay, 2013; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).2However, we have little knowledge of how that restraint is legiti-mized, justified, and buttressed publicly. As Steele (2019) argues, in addition to systemic considerations, normative commitments, or institutional\nconstraints, restraint needs to be strategically narrated. When cyber intru-sions go public\u2014such as in the cases below\u2014targeted states employ \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to contain the crisis and avoid escalation. In light of research that emphasizes the importance of public attitudes toward retalia-tion against cyber intrusions (Hedgecock & Sukin, 2023; Kreps & Schneider, 2019), the rhetorical strategies described below can be used to reduce pressure to retaliate as well as to justify why retaliation is not necessary. In the broader discussion about the possibilities for de-securitizing cyber intru-sions, the content of the rhetoric described below can be seen as an attempt to \u201clower the cyber rhetoric and hyperbole\u201d or \u201ctone down\u201d its existential dimensions (Burton & Lain, 2020, pp. 462\u2013463).\nTheoretically, our findings broaden constructivist scholarship on the repertoire of strategies used by states to cope with image-related damage. Existing works on stigma, shaming, and wrongdoing examine how states respond to accusations regarding their normative transgressions, and how they deal with the harm to their image and identity\u2014employing strategies of avoidance, rejection, acceptance, or containment (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). In contrast, this article analyzes a different type of image-related harm, caused by being vul-nerable. Doing so, allows us to uncover additional micro-strategies used by states to manage their images. Thus, the empirical findings from the cyber context can serve as a starting point to explore \u201cface-saving\u201d discourse in other contexts of perceived state failures\u2014inability to deal with an environ-mental disaster, a health crisis, or even in response to some kinetic attacks. We discuss these possibilities in the concluding section.\nThe Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regard-ing face-saving rhetoric in the cyber context. These countries are particularly concerned about their domestic and international image and they tie this image to their level of technological development (Hertog & Luciani, 2011, p. 248; Shires, 2021b, p. 27). Further, focusing on the Gulf countries sheds light on a non-Western cyber conflict context and underscores the agency of states located in the Global South to publicly interpret cyber intrusions in front of domestic, regional, and international audiences.\nWe begin by situating this study within the intersection of cyber conflict and impression management. Building on existing literature on offensive cyber operations, we suggest that public, visible, and high-profile cyber intrusions might be perceived by domestic and international audiences as embarrassing to the targeted states. To manage this public impression, states adopt \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies intended to mitigate the harm to the state\u2019s image. Following a methodological section detailing our procedure for discourse analysis, the article introduces a typology of \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies drawing partly on the conceptual language of \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). We find that Gulf countries have a repertoire\nof strategies\u2014diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accus-ing strategies\u2014used to narrate the intrusion. Specifically, our discourse analy-sis shows that intrusions that involved faking or leaking information included additional rhetorical strategies than intrusions that involved hacking alone. We conclude our discussion by suggesting how our findings can travel beyond the cyber domain and the Gulf region.\nCyber intrusions and image costs\nOur research question\u2014how do states \u201csave face\u201d following a public cyber intrusion that they suffered\u2014rests on the assumption that the publicity of the intrusion entails image-related costs. First, when a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge (i.e., exposed by the media, the initiators, or third-party actors), it reveals the targeted state\u2019s shortcomings and vulner-abilities. It publicly shows the targeted state\u2019s incompetence to prevent or block an intrusion and its failure to guarantee security for its government offices, critical infrastructure, citizens, or investors. In addition to technical reasons and intelligence concerns (Broeders et al., 2019; Riemer, 2021), states\u2019 inability to block or prevent a cyber intrusion might be experienced (or at least seen by others) as damaging their self-image.3 \n\tThe existing literature on cyber conflict already points to these image-related costs faced by targeted states. Rid (2012) suggests that there are incen-tives for governments and firms to keep cyber intrusion secret \u201clest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment\u201d (pp. 28\u201329). Waxman (2013) claims that targeted states \u201cmay be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of cyberattacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions\u201d (p. 119). Libicki (2012) explains that targeted states might say nothing in response to a cyber intrusion because it would require them to \u201cadmit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned,\u201d and because \u201cthere is no pride involved in being a victim\u201d (p. 45). While in some cases, targeted states prefer to disclose the fact that they have been attacked (for instance, to justify retaliation), existing data show that targeted states often choose not to do so (Baram & Sommer, 2019).\nSecond, some cyber intrusions purposefully seek to embarrass the target by revealing sensitive data, government secrets, intimate details, or even planting \u201cfake news\u201d (Kostyuk & Zhukov, 2019, p. 320; Lindsay, 2015, pp. 56\u201357; Nye, 2017, p. 48; Sharp, 2017; Shuya, 2018, p. 11). This intensifies the concern for the state image\u2014not only that the initiator successfully pene-trated supposedly protected computer systems, but it also manipulated sen-sitive information or exposed private information to the public. Leaking\nsensitive information often reveals a gap between the government\u2019s state-ments and its practice or reveals governmental wrongdoing that the govern-ment was trying to hide. Indeed, Shires (2020) conceptualizes \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusions as a simulation of a scandal aimed to embarrass the target.\nPublic discourse also reproduces the perception that being attacked in cyberspace damages the state\u2019s image. For instance, successful intrusions into the websites or services of government agencies are described as \u201cembar-rassing\u201d or \u201chumiliating\u201d (Ashkenaz, 2022; Bob, 2022; Kahan, 2020; Kalman, 2011). Referring to the theft of US government workers\u2019 data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), attributed to China, Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA, reflected on the US image, noting:\u201cThis is not \u2018shame on China.\u2019 This is \u2018shame on us\u2019 for not protecting that kind of information\u201d (Paletta, 2015). Following the hack of the British Army social media accounts, a UK parliament member claimed it was\u201cembarrassing\u201d (Clinton, 2022). As the literature on emotions and IR argues, these various affective modes\u2014shame, humiliation, or embarrass-ment\u2014have undesirable implications for states\u2019 sense of Self and how they are seen by significant others (Lupovici, 2016b, pp. 66\u201369; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013).4Anecdotally, the term \u201cp0wned\u201d is used in hackers\u2019 slang to signal humiliation\u2014being defeated or controlled by someone else.\nThe understanding that states are concerned about their image and that image-related concerns matter for conflict escalation is not new to IR literature. Several studies indicate that humiliating or embarrassing an opponent might magnify pressures to retaliate due to the psychological fea-tures of specific leaders, public demands, or concerns regarding the inter-national image of the state (Carson, 2016; Masterson, 2022; Wolf, 2011; Yarhi-Milo, 2018). Another line of research elaborates on the \u201cface work\u201demployed by states to mitigate embarrassment, shame, or guilt. For instance, in response to international accusations regarding normative transgressions, states use strategies such as apologizing, counter-shaming, or containing in order to protect the damage to their image (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Kampf & L\u00f6wenheim, 2012; Lind, 2011; O. L\u00f6wenheim & Heimann, 2008; Snyder, 2020). A public cyber intrusion brings about an ana-lytically different challenge to the state\u2019s image, similar to the one felt when admitting a failure or an injury.\nWhen a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge, states need to miti-gate these image-related costs by narrating the event. As the broader research agenda linking constructivist IR to cybersecurity highlights, cyber intrusions are not merely technical phenomena but socio-political ones that are inter-subjectively interpreted. For instance, several studies trace how cyber-related discourse (e.g., representations, metaphors, and analogies but also non-textual practices) constitutes cyberspace as a domain, frames particular policy problems and solutions, and forges links between cyber, security, or\nrisks (Branch, 2019; Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2014). Similarly, attribution, rather than being a purely technical process, is a socially managed one that instills meaning in an uncertain cyber intrusion (Egloff, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a). Moreover, cyber intrusions might challenge states\u2019 ability to function as ontological security providers. Such intrusions may challenge the state\u2019s role to serve as a secure space for the nation (Lupovici, 2023). Thus, public and visible cyber intrusions require states to craft symbolic and per-formative strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect or enhance their image, perform as security providers, and avoid the unease associated with the intrusion. In addition to other goals, such as obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted or repairing diplomatic relations with the potential initiator, targeted states need to address, explain, and narrate what happened. The following section discusses these strategies.\nResponding to public cyber intrusions\nWhen cyber intrusions remain covert (not publicly known or exposed), they take place \u201cbackstage\u201d without much public audience. In such cases, targeted states can choose to remain silent\u2014concealing the fact that they have been attacked, avoiding public embarrassment altogether, and removing the need to employ a rhetorical strategy. For instance, several successful hacking oper-ations by CopyKittens\u2014a cyber espionage group associated with Iran\u2014were never reported in the mainstream Arab media. Despite the successful extrac-tion of a large amount of government and military data in Saudi Arabia and the exposure of the intrusion by private cyber companies, the Saudi govern-ment never disclosed that such an intrusion took place.\nWhen cyber intrusions have visible consequences, such as damage to the global oil supply, a massive leak of data, or a kinetic impact, it is harder for states to remain silent. In these moments, states can seize the inherent ambi-guity and the lack of details to deny that there was any intrusion. For instance, states can claim that a technical malfunction or an accident hap-pened, thus suggesting that the incident was out of their control. For example, the cyber intrusion that caused a major power outage at the Natanz nuclear facility in April 2021, was first described by Iran as an \u201cacci-dent\u201d (Coulter, 2021).\nThese two strategies\u2014staying silent or denying a cyber intrusion took place\u2014are not always viable. Cyber intrusions sometimes become public knowledge when they are exposed by external actors or by the targeted state itself.5In such moments, states need to face domestic, regional, and international audiences and explain why were they targeted, why was the intrusion successful, and what measures have been taken to address the situ-ation. In other words, states engage in \u201cremedial self-presentation\u201d\n(Schlenker & Darby, 1981) to narrate their failure and cast themselves in a less negative light.6 \n\tTo identify these rhetorical strategies, we draw on literature focusing on\u201cImage Repair\u201d and Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). These works primarily examine the strategies used by corporations to repair their reputations following a crisis. By releas-ing official statements, organizing press conferences, conducting interviews, and sending messages to the public, corporate officials engage in rhetorical strategies aimed at framing the crisis in a certain way and protecting the cor-poration\u2019s reputation in front of multiple audiences. These strategies involve denial (\u201cthe event did not happen\u201d), evading responsibility (\u201cthe event was accidental\u201d), reducing offensiveness (\u201cthe event was not that bad\u201d or\u201cdespite the event, we are so good\u201d), mortification (\u201cwe apologize for the event\u201d), and corrective action (\u201cwe are taking steps to prevent future similar events\u201d) (Benoit, 2014, pp. 22\u201329).\nTranslating these insights to the cyber realm, we expect the choice of rhe-torical strategy to depend on the kind of event. Specifically, intrusions that involve leaking sensitive information or spreading fake rumors might be par-ticularly damaging to the state\u2019s image. Not only that targeted states have to deal with the intrusion itself but they also need to address the scandal regard-ing the leaked or falsified information (Shires, 2020). In these cases, we expect to find intense rhetorical strategies addressing the leaked or falsified information. Drawing on the conceptual language of \u201cimage repair\u201d and crisis communication theories, this article employs original discourse analy-sis to identify the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs caused by a publicly visible cyber intrusion and when they use each. To do so, we use an abductive methodological approach as detailed in the following section.\nMethodology\nCase-selection\nOur analytical approach to studying states\u2019 discursive responses to cyber intrusions follows several steps. The research question, which focuses on governments\u2019 rhetorical responses, led us to focus only on intrusions that targeted government agencies or critical infrastructure within a country. Intrusion that targeted non-state actors, commercial companies, or societal organization were not studied. We further limited the universe of cases to include only cyber intrusions that took place in the Gulf countries for three main reasons. First, in general, cyber interactions tend to be of regional character and the Middle East has been known as one of the most active regions in terms of cyber activity (Valeriano & Maness, 2015, p. 129).\nHowever, the Gulf countries share unique features that distinguish them from other countries in the region both domestically and in relation to cyber conflict (Shires, 2018, p. 34). The exclusion of other countries in the region is also useful to limit the comparison to relatively similar political systems and patterns of civil-society relations.\nSecond, the Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regarding \u201csaving face\u201d strategies. These countries have been known to be particularly occupied with their domestic and international image. Their pol-itical economic strategy is significantly based on projecting a strong, innova-tive, and technologically modern image abroad (Cooke, 2014; Gray, 2016; Kamrava, 2013). In addition, their neo-patrimonial and authoritarian char-acter means that domestic political rule is based on fostering an image of strong leadership, maintaining a high degree of control over information, and silencing criticism in order to sustain regime legitimacy (Dukalskis, 2021; Gray, 2011, p. 7; Khatib & Maziad, 2019, p. 9).\nThird, most of the scholarly and policy debate about cyber conflict has focused on Russia, China, and the United States as well as the challenges posed by North Korea and Iran (Buchanan & Cunningham, 2020; Farwell & Rohozinski, 2011; Lindsay et al., 2015; Shackelford et al., 2017). Little attention has been paid to the Arab world compared to other regions (For an exception, see Shires, 2021b). Similarly, most works on cyber intrusions rely on English sources. Instead, we analyze original documents in Arabic to study how state elites mediate cyber intrusion to their public.\nTo identify the relevant cyber intrusions, we built an original dataset of Arabic sources using the general framework of the Dyadic Cyber Incident Dataset (DCID) version 1.1 as a baseline and added data for the years 2010\u20132019, based on the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker dataset. We included only intrusions that were verified by two cred-ible and reliable sources (such as cybersecurity companies\u2019 reports as well as media reports such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and more). Overall, our data includes the following five cases:7\n(1) Cyber intrusion on the Saudi oil company Aramco (Shamoon, August 2012): On August 15, 2012, Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil and gas firm\u2014and the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u2014Saudi Aramco, suffered a major cyberattack that infected more than 35,000 computers in the company\u2019s network. The incident was first revealed on Pastebin by a message from a hacking group named \u201cCutting Sword of Justice\u201d (Weitzenkorn, 2012). Later that day, Aramco\u2019s Facebook page posted an English message noting that the company had isolated its systems as a precautionary measure due to a network disruption caused by a virus (Lennon, 2012). Despite its vast resources, Saudi Aramco took almost two weeks to recover from the attack and restore the damage (Bronk &\nTikk-Ringas, 2013). The malware that was used for this attack, called Shamoon and revealed by the Russian-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky, erased data on three-quarters of Aramco\u2019s corporate PCs\u2014documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, files, and more. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Perlroth, 2012).\n(2) Hack-and-leak intrusion in Saudi Arabia (May-June 2015): On May 20, 2015, as a Saudi-led coalition was conducting airstrikes in Yemen, the\u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d announced that they had hacked several Saudi ministries in \u201cOperation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi,\u201d named after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen. The group declared they had gained \u201cfull control\u201d of over 3,000 computers and servers belonging to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign, Interior, and Defense Ministries (Fars News Agency, 2015). They also released nearly 2,000 internal emails, documents, and information about citizens and person-nel of the Saudi MFA (Paganini, 2015) In the following weeks, additional documents have been released and the group even threatened to wipe the MFA\u2019s computers automatically. Finally, on June 19th,2015, Wiki-Leaks released \u201cThe Saudi Cables\u201d partially based on the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u2019s\u201d hack (WikiLeaks, 2015). It has been estimated that Iran stands behind the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d (Franceschi-Bicchierai, 2015), although others have argued that this group is used as a front for the Russian group Sofacy (Bartholomew & Guerrero-Saade, 2016).\n(3) Shamoon 2.0 in Saudi Arabia (November 2016-January 2017): At the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, Saudi Arabia suffered another major cyberattack, with similar characteristics to the 2012 one. These intrusions were publicly revealed by several US security firms (e.g., CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Symantec) (Finkle & Wagstaff, 2016). Thousands of computers were damaged at the headquarters of the General Authority of Civil Aviation starting in mid-November, erasing critical data and bringing operations to a halt for several days (Riley et al., 2016). Another victim of this attack was the Jubail-based Sadara Chemical Co, a joint venture firm owned by Saudi Aramco and U.S. company Dow Chemical. In this case, too, cybersecurity researchers estimated Iran was the initiator of the attack (Williams, 2017).\n(4) Hack-and-fake intrusion in Qatar (May-June 2017): On May 24, 2017, the Qatari News Agency\u2019s (QNA) website, Twitter, and YouTube accounts published false statements allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The false statements\u2014focused on Qatar\u2019s foreign policy\u2014served as a pretext for a broader diplomatic crisis. Despite repeated Qatari statements that the information was fabricated,\nmedia outlets in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia engaged in a \u201csustained medial onslaught\u201d against Qatar (Fattah, 2017; Ulrichsen, 2017). Further, only a few days after the incident, on June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the U.A.E. (\u201cThe Quartet\u201d) severed diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, withdrew their nationals, and issued a travel ban on Qatar (Mitchell, 2021; Soubrier et al., 2021). While IP address data pointed to Russia, additional information and investigation pointed to the UAE as a more likely initiator (Shires, 2021a).\n(5) Series of cyber intrusions in Bahrain (July-August 2019): In July-August 2019, Bahraini authorities detected and reported that several networks of Bahrain\u2019s government agencies, including the Electricity and Water Authority, the National Security Agency, the Ministry of Interior, and the Office of the First Deputy Prime Minister were hacked. No discern-ible damage was reported, so the nature of these intrusions was not very visible publicly. The primary repercussion of these intrusions on Bah-raini citizens seemed to be that during June, July, and August 2019, elec-tricity and water bills were tremendously higher than usual, leading to many citizens\u2019 complaints. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Doffman, 2019; Hope et al., 2019).\nThese cyberattacks and intrusions vary along two main dimensions: the method of the attacks and the type of target. The method of the attack ranges from hacking, hacking-and-leaking, hacking-and-faking, or covert disruption. The targets of the intrusions range from critical infrastructures (such as Saudi oil company Aramco) to governmental agencies (such as gov-ernment ministries) as well as national media channels (such as the Qatari national news agency). The vast difference between the cases is quite useful for identifying common and divergent rhetorical strategies used when facing a public cyber intrusion.\nDiscourse analysis\nOnce all our cases were identified, we moved to systematically collect discur-sive responses to these intrusions. First, we checked whether a specific intru-sion was reported in the state\u2019s newspapers and whether state officials responded to this intrusion. Second, we collected all statements that were issued by an official state figure. In each country, we surveyed the official websites of the relevant authorities as well as their Facebook and Twitter accounts. We also looked at widely-circulated and semiofficial newspapers known to reflect the government\u2019s approach (in Saudi Arabia\u2014al-Riadh and al-Madina; in Bahrain\u2014al-Bilad, al-Ayam; in Qatar\u2014al-Watan and al-Raya). In addition, we included additional Arabic news sources, such as\nAlarabiya Net, Al-Jazeera, and Bahrain Mirror looking for references for cyber intrusions.8 \n\tTo map the rhetorical strategies used in these texts, we employed abduc-tive methodological reasoning. As explained by Friedrichs and Kratochwil (2009), \u201c[i]nstead of trying to impose an abstract theoretical template (deduction) or \u2018simply\u2019 inferring propositions from facts (induction), we start reasoning at an intermediate level (abduction)\u201d (p. 709). This means that we moved back and forth between the categories already identified by\u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories and the empirical textual data at hand. On the one hand, we compared the textual data to exist-ing categories identified by the literature (e.g., \u201cbolstering\u201d or \u201cminimizing\u201d). On the other hand, we coded new categories based on the emerging data. The coding procedure involved two independent research assistants blind to each other coding. After coding one case, we had a collaborative meeting to refine the labels and continued coding independently all the other cases. Thus, our abductive method combined the deductive ascription of preexisting cat-egories with an inductive interpretation of the text. The full discursive data, which includes about 240 statements, appears in the supplemental material file.\nMessages are crafted to shape the opinion of a target audience. Looking at discourse in Arabic makes it difficult to determine which audience was tar-geted. While governments probably address their domestic audience, they also take into consideration regional Arab-speaking audiences. This is par-ticularly true in the Gulf context, where neighboring countries are involved in initiating the cyber intrusions described below. Official press conferences and announcements are also targeting international audiences, as English-speaking media picks up and translates government messages. Thus, our analysis cannot determine audience-related influences, and this aspect merits additional research.\n\u201cFace-saving\u201d strategies following public cyber intrusions\nBased on the discursive data, we can identify multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies used by Gulf countries following a public cyber intrusion. These can be classified under three broad categories: diminishing strategies, self-compli-menting strategies, and accusing strategies. These differ from one another in their object of focus (the attack, the state itself, or the initiator) and in the way they address the image-related needs of the state. Diminishing strat-egies reduce the impact and the seriousness of the intrusion itself. Self-com-plimenting strategies seek to portray the targeted state in a good and positive light. Accusing strategies direct the attention toward the initiator. Table 1 below summarizes the various strategies.9\nTable 1. Rhetorical strategies following a cyber intrusion.\nDiminishing strategies\nDiminishing strategies involve (1) minimizing the effect of the intrusion or (2) normalizing it as a routine part of international politics. In cases of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, another strategy manifests itself: (3) debunking\u2014claiming that the information is fabricated.\nFirst, states use a minimizing strategy to reduce the impact, magnitude, or scale of the incident, claiming that nothing serious has happened (\u201cit\u2019s not as bad as it seems\u201d). This strategy seeks to convince the audience that the incident is not significant and that no serious damage was incurred, thus reducing the damage to the state\u2019s image. For instance, following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, Maj. Gen. Al-Turki, organized a press conference, claiming that \u201cthe hacking attempt did not reach its goals\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Immediately after, the chairperson of the investigation committee and the deputy director-general of strategic plan-ning in Aramco added that despite some damage, \u201cthe attackers did not reach their intended goal \u2026 \u201d and that \u201cthere was no impact on the company\u2019s con-tinued oil and gas production\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Following the 2017 intru-sion using Shamoon 2.0, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture stated that \u201cour systems operate at full capacity and were not affected by that attacks of Shamoon 2.0 attacks and the ransomware virus\u201d(Okaz, 2017). To mitigate the public damage caused by planning fake infor-mation on the Qatari news website, Qatar\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs emphasized that \u201cthe cooperation between Qatar and the United States or any other friendly country was not affected\u201d (Qatar MFA, 2017f).\nSecond, states use a normalizing strategy to reduce the uniqueness of the event, framing it as a routine part of global politics (\u201cnothing is out of the ordinary\u201d). By claiming that other states experience cyber intrusions or that they happen all the time, this strategy de-individuates the targeted state (i.e., avoids signaling it out) and reduces some level of responsibility from the targeted state. In the case of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake intru-sions, states can claim that the information leaked does not reveal anything out of the ordinary. Following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the company stated that \u201cAramco is not the only company that was exposed to this type of operations, and this isn\u2019t the first nor the last time we\u2019ll see this type of attack\u201d (Al-Hawawi, 2012). In 2016, after the intrusion of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Al-Saadoun, the chairperson of the Security Affairs Committee in the Saudi Shura Council stated that: \u201cthe Kingdom is targeted the same as other countries, and all countries suffer from these attacks\u201d (Al-Turaisi, 2016). In Bahrain, a technology expert and a parliament member noted the fact that there are numerous intrusions all over the world and emphasized that even American companies lost money due to cyber intrusions (Al-Bilad, 2019).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake cyber intrusions, states can use a debunking strategy and claim that the information is fabri-cated (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d). When using this strategy, states will provide evidence that the information is untrue and will try to change the narrative to high-light their version of the truth. Debunking does not only involve disputing the content of the information but also preventing the dissemination of the information by issuing \u201cfake news\u201d warnings or even shutting down media channels (especially in more authoritarian settings). In the Qatari, Bahraini, and Saudi (2015) cases, official representatives issued statements emphasizing the leaks are fabricated (Al-Bilad, 2017; GCO, 2017; Qatar MFA, 2017b, 2017a; Saudi Arabia, MFA, 2015a, 2015b).\nOverall, diminishing strategies help protect the image of the targeted state by reducing the magnitude of the failure and trying to change beliefs regard-ing the responsibility of the targeted state. A minimization strategy seeks to convince the audience that the intrusion was not significant (hence, the state failure was not that bad). In addition to the domestic audience, this strategy can be also used to signal to the initiator that their intrusion did not achieve its goals. By employing these strategies, the victim aims to downplay poten-tial tensions and subtly communicate a message to the adversary. A normal-ization strategy seeks to convince the audience that cyber intrusions are a regular feature of international politics (hence, there is nothing uniquely wrong about the targeted state). A debunking strategy seeks to convince the audience that leaked information is wrong (hence, rectifying the image of the targeted state).\nSelf-complimenting strategies\nStates can use self-complimenting strategies to highlight their positive traits. They \u201cmitigate the negative effects of the act on the actor by strengthening the audience\u2019s positive affect for the actor\u201d (Benoit, 2014, p. 24). Specifically, our findings identify three such strategies. First, as image-repair theorists note, states can use a bolstering strategy to identify themselves \u201cwith some-thing viewed favorably by the audience\u201d (Ware & Linkugel, 1973, p. 277). In this strategy, states emphasize their successes, their international connec-tions, and their good values (\u201clook how good we are\u201d).\nIn several of our cases, the state officials emphasized their success in quickly blocking the intrusion or continuing their operations despite it. Some statements highlight that the state did so independently without help from external sources (Al-Ghamdi, 2012), while other statements emphasize how quick and efficient the state was in dealing with the intrusion or how many intrusions had been blocked before (Al-Arabiya, 2017; Al-Bilad, 2019; Al-Hawawi, 2012). Further, the statements often noted the good standing of the state within the international community and their\nability to secure international cooperation to investigate the intrusion (Al-Ghamdi, 2012; Qatar MFA, 2017c, 2017d, 2017e).\nSecond, states can assure the audience that measures have been taken to guarantee future protection. We label this strategy reasserting control as it involves a symbolic display of efforts showing that the government is com-mitted and well-functioning (\u201ceverything is under control\u201d). Our findings show that states repeatedly emphasized that they would investigate, establish new cyber institutions, and develop new cyber regulations. Further, in many cases, press conferences included specific and detailed technical explanations to signal authoritative and thorough knowledge regarding what happened. Qatar, which suffered a hack-and-fake intrusion, even produced an impress-ive and dramatic movie clip documenting the intrusion step-by-step. The image-related dimensions of this clip, broadcasted publicly during a press conference, are self-evident (Al-Shiyadhmi, 2017).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, states need to work \u201cuphill\u201d to correct the information that was leaked or faked. Thus, states use the strategy of correcting, which involves rebutting misinformation by providing an alternative and beneficial description of the \u201ctruth\u201d (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d). The goal of a correcting strategy is to replace the image cultivated by the leaked or fabricated infor-mation with a new\u2014more positive\u2014image. The correcting strategy was intensively used by Qatar following the planting of a fake news story on the QNA website. Qatari officials released statements emphasizing that\u201cthe relationship between Qatar and the United States is strong and strategic\u201dor that \u201cQatar has always maintained friendly relations with the Gulf States\u201d(Qatar MFA, 2017f;\ufeed\ufeaf\ufe8d\ufead\ufe93\ufe8d\ufedf\ufea8\ufe8e\ufead\ufe9f\ufef4\ufe94-\ufed7\ufec4\ufeae,2017 ). The correcting strategy was used only in the Qatari case. In this case, a lot of embarrassing information was published in a short time and it seems that choosing the correcting strat-egy was an efficient way for Qatar to mitigate the embarrassment.\nOverall, self-complimenting strategies aim to improve the image of the tar-geted states following a public cyber intrusion. A bolstering strategy seeks to shift the discussion to emphasize the positive traits of the targeted state. Reas-serting control seeks to convince the audience that the state is competent, capable, and manages the situation. As Shandler and Gomez (2022) show, cyber intrusions diminish public confidence in the government. Thus, reas-serting control aims to restore such confidence within the domestic public as well asinternational businesses. A correcting strategyseeks to present infor-mation in a way that will shed good light on the targeted state.\nAccusing strategies\nStates can adopt accusing strategies to denigrate the attacking state and cast it in a bad light. By accusing another actor, the state shifts the blame to the\nexternal actor and situates itself as a victim of bad behavior by others (Benoit, 2014, p. 25). We classify the sub-strategies following Finnemore and Hollis who identify three discrete processes (2020, p. 974).\nFirst, once the intrusion becomes public knowledge, states employ the strategy of exposing. They disclose what happened to third parties, acknowl-edging publicly that they have been attacked (\u201cwe have been attacked\u201d). In all of our cases, state officials issued brief statements admitting that there was an intrusion and providing general details about it. The degree of exposure was dependent on the degree of publicity the intrusion received. For instance, immediately after the Saudi 2015 intrusion, the Spokesperson of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Osama Bin Ahmed Nuqli, only stated that the MFA computer was hacked (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015a). About a month later, when Saudi documents were leaked, Nuqli issued a new statement con-necting the leaked documents to the earlier cyber intrusion (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015b).\nSecond, in addition to exposing the intrusion, states can engage in the strategy of condemning (\u201cthey are bullies\u201d), which is the process of signaling disapproval of what happened, delegitimizing it, and casting the other side in a bad light. Our findings demonstrate that states often use negative and dero-gatory labels to describe the cyber intrusion or its initiators, such as crime/ criminals, terrorism, enemies of the state, illegitimate actions, and shameful acts. This strategy was used by all states as well and was among the first ones to be used.\nThird, states can also ascribe the intrusion to a particular actor, a strategy known as attributing (\u201cthis is who did it\u201d). The vast literature on attribution highlights the technical, political, and social aspects related to attribution. While attribution can help states \u201cname and shame\u201d the initiator and address public demands for answers, there are also some incentives to eschew attribution, such as maintaining secrecy or strategic calculations (Borghard & Lonergan, 2019; Egloff, 2020b, 2020a; Rid & Buchanan, 2015).\nOverall, accusing strategies seek to shift audience perceptions regarding responsibility\u2014rather than focusing on the failure of the targeted state, these strategies seek to attribute responsibility to a malevolent actor. A second possible goal is norm-setting or norm-reinforcing. By denigrating the intrusion (and/or the initiator) the targeted state reproduces what is appropriate behavior in international politics (Egloff, 2020b; Egloff & Smeets, 2021). That said, harsh accusing strategies could potentially increase the risk of escalation (Egloff, 2020b).\nRhetorical strategies in practice\nIn addition to identifying the variety of strategies employed by the Gulf States following a public cyber intrusion, we can move on to offer some\nTable 2. Distribution of strategies per intrusion.\ngeneral insights regarding the practical use of these strategies. We find that the various strategies were used differently across our cases (table 2).\nOn the one hand, we find that exposing the intrusion, condemning it, and normalizing it were commonly used in all of our cases. Similarly, the rhetori-cal strategies of reasserting control following the intrusion and bolstering the image of the targeted state also appeared in all cases. This suggests that the Gulf countries are indeed sensitive to their image following a cyber intrusion and indicates that these strategies might serve as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of image management rhetoric. It could also suggest that there is a common repertoire of rhetorical strategies commonly used in the region (or internationally) fol-lowing a failure event. On the other hand, we find that hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions involve additional strategies that do not appear in other intrusions. Specifically, the strategies of debunking (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d) and correcting (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d) are uniquely used when private information is leaked or fake information is disseminated. This finding is also supported in the Saudi case, where the strategy of debunking primarily appeared after the Saudi Cables were released. It seems that this strategy is more useful when the fabricated information is already outed by others, and the victim states use it to minimize the reputa-tional damage in the fastest way possible\u2014by claiming it is a lie. Further, the strategy of minimizing was used in most cases except the Bahraini one. This can be explained by the fact that there was no visible damage in the Bahraini intrusion.\nWhen appeared, the strategy of attribution emerged relatively little in gov-ernment discourse. Interestingly, only in the Qatari and Bahraini cases, there was a clear public attribution directed at the UAE and Iran, respectively. However, in both cases, such attribution came only after an American source had already attributed the intrusion. It is plausible that Bahrain and\nQatar preferred to \u201cpass the buck,\u201d allowing the hegemon to publicly attri-bute the intrusion, minimizing the risk of escalation and retaliation. These findings resonate with recent works that claim that attribution is a political decision as well as a technical one. The rhetorical strategy of attribution did not appear in any of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrusions. This behavior might be explained by the Saudi\u2019s inclination not to risk escalation or compel the per-petrator to respond if attribution is publicly made. Since Saudi Arabia and Iran are in constant rivalry and share inspiration as regional powers, choos-ing the option of a public attribution strategy might have greater escalation risks compared to the cases of Qatar and Bahrain.\nIn terms of sequencing, we did not find a particular order in the appear-ance of rhetorical strategies. As can be seen in the supplementary file, early responses were relatively short and mainly included the strategies of expos-ing coupled with minimizing and normalizing.\nConclusions\nWhen thinking about the public response of states to public cyber intrusions, existing literature primarily discusses the risks of retaliation or escalation (Healey & Jervis, 2020; Libicki, 2020; Valeriano et al., 2018) as well as attri-bution (Egloff, 2020b; Rid & Buchanan, 2015). However, as this article shows, states engage in multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to manage their image and legitimize their restraint. Attribution is only one rhetorical option out of many.\nOur systematic discourse analysis of five cyber intrusions in Gulf states advances three findings. First, drawing partly on the conceptual language used by \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis-communication theories, the article cat-egorizes three broad \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies adopted by states following a public cyber intrusion: diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accusing strategies. Second, the results suggest that different contextual factors shape the specific strategies used. In cyber intrusions that involve leaking or faking information, unique strategies of debunking or correcting were used. Third, regarding attribution, the cases involving Saudi Arabia\u2014a regional power\u2014did not include public attribution. In contrast, Bahrain and Qatar\u2014smaller powers\u2014did attribute the intrusions but did so only after such attribution was made by American media. These suggestive contextual factors might be used in future research on the rhetoric of cyber responses in other areas.\nIt is important to acknowledge that our findings are not exhaustive and do not include all possible strategies. For instance, our focus on public cyber intrusion means that the strategies of silence (not responding at all) or denial (claiming that nothing happened) were not really usable strategies. Further, theoretically, states also have the option of apologizing to their\npublic for not preventing the intrusion. While apologizing might be con-sidered appropriate in some contexts (Aldar et al., 2021; Lind, 2011; N. L\u00f6wenheim, 2009),10it seems unlikely that a public apology by the targeted states would help mitigate any image-related costs. Instead, apologizing would probably be interpreted as an admission of failure and responsibility.\nThe discursive toolkit identified in this article is not necessarily unique to the Gulf countries. Israel, Albania, and the US\u2014different from the Gulf countries and each other in their regime type\u2014also employed similar strat-egies in response to cyber intrusions directed at them. For instance, after a cyber intrusion against Israel\u2019s water facilities in April 2020, Israeli officials employed the rhetorical strategies of minimizing and reasserting control, stating \u201c[t]he attempted attack was dealt with by the Water Authority and National Cyber Directorate. It should be emphasized that there was no harm to the water supply and it operated, and continues to operate, without interruption\u201d (TOI, 2020). Albania\u2019s response to the Iranian cyber-attack against its governmental systems in September 2022 also involved minimizing and reasserting control. In a video message, the Albanian Prime Minister stated that \u201cThe said attack failed its purpose. Damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor. All systems came back fully operational and there was no irreversible wiping of data\u201d (Republic of Albania, 2022). Both countries also used accusing strat-egies and attributed these intrusions to Iran.\nIn response to the data breach of the OPM in June 2015, The White House Press Secretary primarily employed the strategy of exposing and reasserting control, while avoiding attribution early on. It also used a normalizing strat-egy stating that \u201cto say that our computer systems in the federal government are at risk is not news \u2026 all of the computer networks on which we interact on a daily basis\u2014whether that\u2019s at work, or when we\u2019re checking our email, or purchasing an airline ticket\u2014that there is risk associated with that\u201d (The White House, 2015). In contrast, following the SolarWinds intrusion into United States government networks in December 2020 the White House added a new rhetorical strategy detailing the retaliatory measures taken against Russia (The White House, 2021)\u2014a strategy that can be classified under \u201cbolstering\u201d attempts.\nAdditional research is required in order to delve more into the conditions that explain variations in the rhetorical repertoire of states\u2014Under which conditions do states use silence compared to rhetoric in response to cyber intrusions? Under which conditions do states use some strategies and not others? And under which conditions do states engage in short, laconic mess-ages compared to detailed press conferences or engaging videos? Possible factors could be related to the type of attack, the extent of the damage, the attack\u2019s degree of publicity, the suspected initiator, and the strategic culture of the specific state. Moreover, while this research does not\nexamine the effectiveness of these rhetorical strategies, experimental social science can identify the micro-foundations that make some strategies more persuasive than others.\nThe rhetorical strategies presented here should not be seen as necessarily tied to the cyber context. For example, scholars on public relations have already examined the use of image-repair strategies by governments or indi-vidual leaders following health or environmental crises (Benoit & Henson, 2009; Chon & Kim, 2022; Zhang & Benoit, 2009). IR scholars can extend the framework suggested here to study how states deal with image-related damage caused by kinetic attacks. A quick look at how Israel discursively responded to incendiary kites fired from the Gaza Strip (causing forest and farmland fires in Israel) provides some preliminary suggestions.\nFirst, similar to the cyber context, accusation strategies also seem to appear in the Israeli response (labeling an intrusion as \u201cterrorism\u201d or an infringement of international law, identifying an actor, or condemning the act). Second, self-complimenting strategies also seem to appear in both con-texts but in different ways. For instance, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister used a bol-stering strategy emphasizing that 400 out of 600 kites were intercepted (Hay, 2018). However, Israel\u2019s rhetoric also pointed to its past reputation as a way to bolster its image as a deterring actor\u2014\u201cWe will act and exact a heavy price. We\u2019ve done it in the past. Remember that, because we will do it again now\u201d(Ahronheim et al., 2020). This rhetorical move of referencing the past was not found in our cases. Third, diminishing strategies, while extensively appearing in our findings, do not seem to be rhetorically prevalent in the Israeli response. These suggestive ideas imply that there might be important normative and socio-political differences in the ways states are expected to manage their image in the cyber vs. the kinetic spheres.\nIn sum, this article shows that in addition to covert technical and political strategies to deal with cyber intrusion, states engage in performative public strategies to manage their image. Identifying the various strategies directs our attention to the agency of states\u2014how targeted states perceive the context of the intrusion, interpret it, and narrate it. Diminishing the magni-tude of a cyber intrusion, complimenting the successes of the Self, and accus-ing the adversary of bad behavior allows states to mitigate image-related costs in front of a domestic and international audience and perform their role as ontological security providers (Lupovici, 2023). \u201cFace-saving\u201d strat-egies are the bread and butter of international society\u2014justifications, apolo-gies, rejections, or acknowledgments\u2014are some of the ways states resolve tensions, legitimize their behavior, and reinforce or contest norms. In the case of public cyber intrusions, these rhetorical strategies narrate the intru-sion, justify the lack of retaliation, and potentially facilitate the de-securitiza-tion of the event.\nNotes\n1. Hack-and-leak operations are defined as \u201can intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak).\u201d Hack-and-fake operations are similarly defined but they involve the public fabrication of information. See Shires, 2019.\n2. For the bigger question of whether cyber capabilities are escalatory, see Bor-\tghard & Lonergan, 2019; Healey & Jervis, 2020.\n3. A similar point is made with regard to countries\u2019 failure to deter (especially when these countries see themselves as deterring actors). Their inability to prevent a challenger damages their sense of Self (Fettweis, 2013; Lupovici, 2016b).\n4. In contrast to shame, which is associated with \u201cperceived deficiencies of one\u2019s core self,\u201d embarrassment is associated with \u201cdeficiencies in one\u2019s presented self.\u201d Thus, shame is a more enduring sense of negative self-evaluation, while embarrassment is tied to more transient, situation-specific failures and pratfalls\u201d(Tangney et al., 1996, p. 1258; cf. Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). Humiliation is under-stood as \u201cas an act of extreme disrespect that intends to deprive an actor of its status as an autonomous agent that counts\u201d (Wolf, 2017, p. 494). It is a result of the actions of another (rather than a failure of the Self) (Lupovici, 2016b, p. 66). 5. The targeted states can also leak information to encourage external actors to reveal the intrusion.\n6. In addition to rhetorical strategies, states also develop legal and institutional \tresponses, see Shires, 2021b.\n7. The datasets we use did not contain any cyber incidents involving the UAE that met our inclusion criteria\u2014such as a range of years, a public response that can be examined in more detail, etc.\n8. We specifically examined the dates in which cyber intrusions were revealed as \twell as key terms in Arabic, such as cyber, hacking, and electronic attack. 9. The impact of these strategies is beyond the scope of this paper.\n10. However, states can also refuse to apologize to protect their identity, see \tZarakol, 2010.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Or Greif, Noya Peer, and Jason Silverman for valuable research assistance, and James Shires and Tarek Tutunji for commenting on previous drafts.

Recent scholarship demonstrates that the covert nature of cyber intrusions allows states to respond with restraint, avoiding escalation. But what happens when cyber intrusions become public and are highly visible? This article examines the rhetorical strategies employed by authoritarian Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs associated with a public cyber intrusion. Drawing on the conceptual language of image-repair and crisis communication theories and employing discourse analysis of original data in Arabic, we identify three types of face-saving strategies: diminishing, self-complimenting, and accusing. Our findings indicate that intrusions involving leaking or faking information bring about unique \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies that do not only deal with the intrusion itself but also with the subsequent information crisis. Overall, the article identifies how states employ diverse rhetorical strategies\u2014beyond attribution\u2014to narrate cyber intrusions and keep cyber conflict contained.\nKEYWORDS Cybersecurity; Middle East; constructivism; image; discourse analysis\nIn July 2017, nearly two months after Qatar had suffered a cyber intrusion,\nthe Qatari Ministry of Interior (MOI) held a press conference to reveal evi-\ndence concerning the intrusion. Rather than only providing technical details,\nthe MOI broadcasted a dramatic video with intense music, thrilling graphics,\nand a spy-style vibe to reveal the intrusion step-by-step (Qatar MOI, 2017).\nIn addition to delegitimizing cyber intrusions as acts of terrorism, the video\nemphasized the Qatari remarkable success in containing the intrusion and\ndetecting its source despite the intrusion\u2019s sophistication.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The terms on which this article has been published allow the posting of the Accepted Manuscript in a repository by the author(s) or with their consent.\nThe Qatari press conference is not unique. When cyber intrusions become public knowledge, states do not only engage in technical strategies to block the intrusion and identify the initiator, but also manage their public relations\u2014they publish messages, hold press conferences, brief reporters, and rhetori-cally try to manage this crisis. These performative, social, and symbolic strat-egies are often left unnoticed in existing research on cyber discourse. While extant studies examine different elements in the discursive construction of cyberspace, threats, and responses (e.g., Branch, 2019; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2017), we know less about the narration of cyber intrusions after they had happened. Of course, many studies zoom-in on the discourse of attribution or credit-claiming by the initiators (e.g., Brown & Fazal, 2021; Egloff, 2020a, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a; Poznansky & Perkoski, 2018), but as this article demonstrates, there is much more going on discursively following cyber intrusions.\n\tThis article explores the rhetorical strategies used by governments in response to a public cyber intrusion they suffered. In addition to obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted, protecting intelligence sources or technical capabilities, and identifying the initiator, we suggest that states employ rhetori-cal strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect their public image in front of domestic, regional, or international audiences. Drawing on two scholarly traditions\u2014the sociology of accounts and apologies (Benoit, 2014; Schlenker, 1980; Scott & Lyman, 1968) and self-presentation theories (Goffman, 1959)\u2014the article maps and categorizes the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf countries to narrate the public cyber intrusion and manage their public impression. We do so via an original discourse analysis of official statements and state-spon-sored media reports in five cyber intrusions that differ in their targets and methods: Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to cyber intrusion against its oil company Aramco (\u201cShamoon,\u201d August 2012), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusion (May-June 2015), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to intrusions using \u201cShamoon 2.0\u201d malware (November 2016-January 2017), Qatar\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-fake\u201d intrusion (May 2017), and Bahrain\u2019s response to multiple hacking operations (July-August 2019).1 \n\tExamining the strategies used by these states to \u201csave face\u201d is important for two reasons. Empirically, these strategies are a crucial stepping-stone to understanding the restraint and the limited nature of cyber conflicts. Existing International Relations (IR) scholarship focuses on the operational aspects of offensive cyber operations (OCOs), showing that targeted states practice restraint in their response to cyber intrusions, and that escalation is not a common practice (Fischerkeller et al., 2022, pp. 130\u2013141; Gartzke, 2013; Jacobsen, 2021; Kaminska, 2021; Lindsay, 2013; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).2However, we have little knowledge of how that restraint is legiti-mized, justified, and buttressed publicly. As Steele (2019) argues, in addition to systemic considerations, normative commitments, or institutional\nconstraints, restraint needs to be strategically narrated. When cyber intru-sions go public\u2014such as in the cases below\u2014targeted states employ \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to contain the crisis and avoid escalation. In light of research that emphasizes the importance of public attitudes toward retalia-tion against cyber intrusions (Hedgecock & Sukin, 2023; Kreps & Schneider, 2019), the rhetorical strategies described below can be used to reduce pressure to retaliate as well as to justify why retaliation is not necessary. In the broader discussion about the possibilities for de-securitizing cyber intru-sions, the content of the rhetoric described below can be seen as an attempt to \u201clower the cyber rhetoric and hyperbole\u201d or \u201ctone down\u201d its existential dimensions (Burton & Lain, 2020, pp. 462\u2013463).\nTheoretically, our findings broaden constructivist scholarship on the repertoire of strategies used by states to cope with image-related damage. Existing works on stigma, shaming, and wrongdoing examine how states respond to accusations regarding their normative transgressions, and how they deal with the harm to their image and identity\u2014employing strategies of avoidance, rejection, acceptance, or containment (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). In contrast, this article analyzes a different type of image-related harm, caused by being vul-nerable. Doing so, allows us to uncover additional micro-strategies used by states to manage their images. Thus, the empirical findings from the cyber context can serve as a starting point to explore \u201cface-saving\u201d discourse in other contexts of perceived state failures\u2014inability to deal with an environ-mental disaster, a health crisis, or even in response to some kinetic attacks. We discuss these possibilities in the concluding section.\nThe Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regard-ing face-saving rhetoric in the cyber context. These countries are particularly concerned about their domestic and international image and they tie this image to their level of technological development (Hertog & Luciani, 2011, p. 248; Shires, 2021b, p. 27). Further, focusing on the Gulf countries sheds light on a non-Western cyber conflict context and underscores the agency of states located in the Global South to publicly interpret cyber intrusions in front of domestic, regional, and international audiences.\nWe begin by situating this study within the intersection of cyber conflict and impression management. Building on existing literature on offensive cyber operations, we suggest that public, visible, and high-profile cyber intrusions might be perceived by domestic and international audiences as embarrassing to the targeted states. To manage this public impression, states adopt \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies intended to mitigate the harm to the state\u2019s image. Following a methodological section detailing our procedure for discourse analysis, the article introduces a typology of \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies drawing partly on the conceptual language of \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). We find that Gulf countries have a repertoire\nof strategies\u2014diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accus-ing strategies\u2014used to narrate the intrusion. Specifically, our discourse analy-sis shows that intrusions that involved faking or leaking information included additional rhetorical strategies than intrusions that involved hacking alone. We conclude our discussion by suggesting how our findings can travel beyond the cyber domain and the Gulf region.\nCyber intrusions and image costs\nOur research question\u2014how do states \u201csave face\u201d following a public cyber intrusion that they suffered\u2014rests on the assumption that the publicity of the intrusion entails image-related costs. First, when a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge (i.e., exposed by the media, the initiators, or third-party actors), it reveals the targeted state\u2019s shortcomings and vulner-abilities. It publicly shows the targeted state\u2019s incompetence to prevent or block an intrusion and its failure to guarantee security for its government offices, critical infrastructure, citizens, or investors. In addition to technical reasons and intelligence concerns (Broeders et al., 2019; Riemer, 2021), states\u2019 inability to block or prevent a cyber intrusion might be experienced (or at least seen by others) as damaging their self-image.3 \n\tThe existing literature on cyber conflict already points to these image-related costs faced by targeted states. Rid (2012) suggests that there are incen-tives for governments and firms to keep cyber intrusion secret \u201clest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment\u201d (pp. 28\u201329). Waxman (2013) claims that targeted states \u201cmay be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of cyberattacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions\u201d (p. 119). Libicki (2012) explains that targeted states might say nothing in response to a cyber intrusion because it would require them to \u201cadmit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned,\u201d and because \u201cthere is no pride involved in being a victim\u201d (p. 45). While in some cases, targeted states prefer to disclose the fact that they have been attacked (for instance, to justify retaliation), existing data show that targeted states often choose not to do so (Baram & Sommer, 2019).\nSecond, some cyber intrusions purposefully seek to embarrass the target by revealing sensitive data, government secrets, intimate details, or even planting \u201cfake news\u201d (Kostyuk & Zhukov, 2019, p. 320; Lindsay, 2015, pp. 56\u201357; Nye, 2017, p. 48; Sharp, 2017; Shuya, 2018, p. 11). This intensifies the concern for the state image\u2014not only that the initiator successfully pene-trated supposedly protected computer systems, but it also manipulated sen-sitive information or exposed private information to the public. Leaking\nsensitive information often reveals a gap between the government\u2019s state-ments and its practice or reveals governmental wrongdoing that the govern-ment was trying to hide. Indeed, Shires (2020) conceptualizes \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusions as a simulation of a scandal aimed to embarrass the target.\nPublic discourse also reproduces the perception that being attacked in cyberspace damages the state\u2019s image. For instance, successful intrusions into the websites or services of government agencies are described as \u201cembar-rassing\u201d or \u201chumiliating\u201d (Ashkenaz, 2022; Bob, 2022; Kahan, 2020; Kalman, 2011). Referring to the theft of US government workers\u2019 data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), attributed to China, Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA, reflected on the US image, noting:\u201cThis is not \u2018shame on China.\u2019 This is \u2018shame on us\u2019 for not protecting that kind of information\u201d (Paletta, 2015). Following the hack of the British Army social media accounts, a UK parliament member claimed it was\u201cembarrassing\u201d (Clinton, 2022). As the literature on emotions and IR argues, these various affective modes\u2014shame, humiliation, or embarrass-ment\u2014have undesirable implications for states\u2019 sense of Self and how they are seen by significant others (Lupovici, 2016b, pp. 66\u201369; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013).4Anecdotally, the term \u201cp0wned\u201d is used in hackers\u2019 slang to signal humiliation\u2014being defeated or controlled by someone else.\nThe understanding that states are concerned about their image and that image-related concerns matter for conflict escalation is not new to IR literature. Several studies indicate that humiliating or embarrassing an opponent might magnify pressures to retaliate due to the psychological fea-tures of specific leaders, public demands, or concerns regarding the inter-national image of the state (Carson, 2016; Masterson, 2022; Wolf, 2011; Yarhi-Milo, 2018). Another line of research elaborates on the \u201cface work\u201demployed by states to mitigate embarrassment, shame, or guilt. For instance, in response to international accusations regarding normative transgressions, states use strategies such as apologizing, counter-shaming, or containing in order to protect the damage to their image (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Kampf & L\u00f6wenheim, 2012; Lind, 2011; O. L\u00f6wenheim & Heimann, 2008; Snyder, 2020). A public cyber intrusion brings about an ana-lytically different challenge to the state\u2019s image, similar to the one felt when admitting a failure or an injury.\nWhen a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge, states need to miti-gate these image-related costs by narrating the event. As the broader research agenda linking constructivist IR to cybersecurity highlights, cyber intrusions are not merely technical phenomena but socio-political ones that are inter-subjectively interpreted. For instance, several studies trace how cyber-related discourse (e.g., representations, metaphors, and analogies but also non-textual practices) constitutes cyberspace as a domain, frames particular policy problems and solutions, and forges links between cyber, security, or\nrisks (Branch, 2019; Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2014). Similarly, attribution, rather than being a purely technical process, is a socially managed one that instills meaning in an uncertain cyber intrusion (Egloff, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a). Moreover, cyber intrusions might challenge states\u2019 ability to function as ontological security providers. Such intrusions may challenge the state\u2019s role to serve as a secure space for the nation (Lupovici, 2023). Thus, public and visible cyber intrusions require states to craft symbolic and per-formative strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect or enhance their image, perform as security providers, and avoid the unease associated with the intrusion. In addition to other goals, such as obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted or repairing diplomatic relations with the potential initiator, targeted states need to address, explain, and narrate what happened. The following section discusses these strategies.\nResponding to public cyber intrusions\nWhen cyber intrusions remain covert (not publicly known or exposed), they take place \u201cbackstage\u201d without much public audience. In such cases, targeted states can choose to remain silent\u2014concealing the fact that they have been attacked, avoiding public embarrassment altogether, and removing the need to employ a rhetorical strategy. For instance, several successful hacking oper-ations by CopyKittens\u2014a cyber espionage group associated with Iran\u2014were never reported in the mainstream Arab media. Despite the successful extrac-tion of a large amount of government and military data in Saudi Arabia and the exposure of the intrusion by private cyber companies, the Saudi govern-ment never disclosed that such an intrusion took place.\nWhen cyber intrusions have visible consequences, such as damage to the global oil supply, a massive leak of data, or a kinetic impact, it is harder for states to remain silent. In these moments, states can seize the inherent ambi-guity and the lack of details to deny that there was any intrusion. For instance, states can claim that a technical malfunction or an accident hap-pened, thus suggesting that the incident was out of their control. For example, the cyber intrusion that caused a major power outage at the Natanz nuclear facility in April 2021, was first described by Iran as an \u201cacci-dent\u201d (Coulter, 2021).\nThese two strategies\u2014staying silent or denying a cyber intrusion took place\u2014are not always viable. Cyber intrusions sometimes become public knowledge when they are exposed by external actors or by the targeted state itself.5In such moments, states need to face domestic, regional, and international audiences and explain why were they targeted, why was the intrusion successful, and what measures have been taken to address the situ-ation. In other words, states engage in \u201cremedial self-presentation\u201d\n(Schlenker & Darby, 1981) to narrate their failure and cast themselves in a less negative light.6 \n\tTo identify these rhetorical strategies, we draw on literature focusing on\u201cImage Repair\u201d and Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). These works primarily examine the strategies used by corporations to repair their reputations following a crisis. By releas-ing official statements, organizing press conferences, conducting interviews, and sending messages to the public, corporate officials engage in rhetorical strategies aimed at framing the crisis in a certain way and protecting the cor-poration\u2019s reputation in front of multiple audiences. These strategies involve denial (\u201cthe event did not happen\u201d), evading responsibility (\u201cthe event was accidental\u201d), reducing offensiveness (\u201cthe event was not that bad\u201d or\u201cdespite the event, we are so good\u201d), mortification (\u201cwe apologize for the event\u201d), and corrective action (\u201cwe are taking steps to prevent future similar events\u201d) (Benoit, 2014, pp. 22\u201329).\nTranslating these insights to the cyber realm, we expect the choice of rhe-torical strategy to depend on the kind of event. Specifically, intrusions that involve leaking sensitive information or spreading fake rumors might be par-ticularly damaging to the state\u2019s image. Not only that targeted states have to deal with the intrusion itself but they also need to address the scandal regard-ing the leaked or falsified information (Shires, 2020). In these cases, we expect to find intense rhetorical strategies addressing the leaked or falsified information. Drawing on the conceptual language of \u201cimage repair\u201d and crisis communication theories, this article employs original discourse analy-sis to identify the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs caused by a publicly visible cyber intrusion and when they use each. To do so, we use an abductive methodological approach as detailed in the following section.\nMethodology\nCase-selection\nOur analytical approach to studying states\u2019 discursive responses to cyber intrusions follows several steps. The research question, which focuses on governments\u2019 rhetorical responses, led us to focus only on intrusions that targeted government agencies or critical infrastructure within a country. Intrusion that targeted non-state actors, commercial companies, or societal organization were not studied. We further limited the universe of cases to include only cyber intrusions that took place in the Gulf countries for three main reasons. First, in general, cyber interactions tend to be of regional character and the Middle East has been known as one of the most active regions in terms of cyber activity (Valeriano & Maness, 2015, p. 129).\nHowever, the Gulf countries share unique features that distinguish them from other countries in the region both domestically and in relation to cyber conflict (Shires, 2018, p. 34). The exclusion of other countries in the region is also useful to limit the comparison to relatively similar political systems and patterns of civil-society relations.\nSecond, the Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regarding \u201csaving face\u201d strategies. These countries have been known to be particularly occupied with their domestic and international image. Their pol-itical economic strategy is significantly based on projecting a strong, innova-tive, and technologically modern image abroad (Cooke, 2014; Gray, 2016; Kamrava, 2013). In addition, their neo-patrimonial and authoritarian char-acter means that domestic political rule is based on fostering an image of strong leadership, maintaining a high degree of control over information, and silencing criticism in order to sustain regime legitimacy (Dukalskis, 2021; Gray, 2011, p. 7; Khatib & Maziad, 2019, p. 9).\nThird, most of the scholarly and policy debate about cyber conflict has focused on Russia, China, and the United States as well as the challenges posed by North Korea and Iran (Buchanan & Cunningham, 2020; Farwell & Rohozinski, 2011; Lindsay et al., 2015; Shackelford et al., 2017). Little attention has been paid to the Arab world compared to other regions (For an exception, see Shires, 2021b). Similarly, most works on cyber intrusions rely on English sources. Instead, we analyze original documents in Arabic to study how state elites mediate cyber intrusion to their public.\nTo identify the relevant cyber intrusions, we built an original dataset of Arabic sources using the general framework of the Dyadic Cyber Incident Dataset (DCID) version 1.1 as a baseline and added data for the years 2010\u20132019, based on the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker dataset. We included only intrusions that were verified by two cred-ible and reliable sources (such as cybersecurity companies\u2019 reports as well as media reports such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and more). Overall, our data includes the following five cases:7\n(1) Cyber intrusion on the Saudi oil company Aramco (Shamoon, August 2012): On August 15, 2012, Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil and gas firm\u2014and the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u2014Saudi Aramco, suffered a major cyberattack that infected more than 35,000 computers in the company\u2019s network. The incident was first revealed on Pastebin by a message from a hacking group named \u201cCutting Sword of Justice\u201d (Weitzenkorn, 2012). Later that day, Aramco\u2019s Facebook page posted an English message noting that the company had isolated its systems as a precautionary measure due to a network disruption caused by a virus (Lennon, 2012). Despite its vast resources, Saudi Aramco took almost two weeks to recover from the attack and restore the damage (Bronk &\nTikk-Ringas, 2013). The malware that was used for this attack, called Shamoon and revealed by the Russian-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky, erased data on three-quarters of Aramco\u2019s corporate PCs\u2014documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, files, and more. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Perlroth, 2012).\n(2) Hack-and-leak intrusion in Saudi Arabia (May-June 2015): On May 20, 2015, as a Saudi-led coalition was conducting airstrikes in Yemen, the\u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d announced that they had hacked several Saudi ministries in \u201cOperation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi,\u201d named after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen. The group declared they had gained \u201cfull control\u201d of over 3,000 computers and servers belonging to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign, Interior, and Defense Ministries (Fars News Agency, 2015). They also released nearly 2,000 internal emails, documents, and information about citizens and person-nel of the Saudi MFA (Paganini, 2015) In the following weeks, additional documents have been released and the group even threatened to wipe the MFA\u2019s computers automatically. Finally, on June 19th,2015, Wiki-Leaks released \u201cThe Saudi Cables\u201d partially based on the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u2019s\u201d hack (WikiLeaks, 2015). It has been estimated that Iran stands behind the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d (Franceschi-Bicchierai, 2015), although others have argued that this group is used as a front for the Russian group Sofacy (Bartholomew & Guerrero-Saade, 2016).\n(3) Shamoon 2.0 in Saudi Arabia (November 2016-January 2017): At the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, Saudi Arabia suffered another major cyberattack, with similar characteristics to the 2012 one. These intrusions were publicly revealed by several US security firms (e.g., CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Symantec) (Finkle & Wagstaff, 2016). Thousands of computers were damaged at the headquarters of the General Authority of Civil Aviation starting in mid-November, erasing critical data and bringing operations to a halt for several days (Riley et al., 2016). Another victim of this attack was the Jubail-based Sadara Chemical Co, a joint venture firm owned by Saudi Aramco and U.S. company Dow Chemical. In this case, too, cybersecurity researchers estimated Iran was the initiator of the attack (Williams, 2017).\n(4) Hack-and-fake intrusion in Qatar (May-June 2017): On May 24, 2017, the Qatari News Agency\u2019s (QNA) website, Twitter, and YouTube accounts published false statements allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The false statements\u2014focused on Qatar\u2019s foreign policy\u2014served as a pretext for a broader diplomatic crisis. Despite repeated Qatari statements that the information was fabricated,\nmedia outlets in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia engaged in a \u201csustained medial onslaught\u201d against Qatar (Fattah, 2017; Ulrichsen, 2017). Further, only a few days after the incident, on June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the U.A.E. (\u201cThe Quartet\u201d) severed diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, withdrew their nationals, and issued a travel ban on Qatar (Mitchell, 2021; Soubrier et al., 2021). While IP address data pointed to Russia, additional information and investigation pointed to the UAE as a more likely initiator (Shires, 2021a).\n(5) Series of cyber intrusions in Bahrain (July-August 2019): In July-August 2019, Bahraini authorities detected and reported that several networks of Bahrain\u2019s government agencies, including the Electricity and Water Authority, the National Security Agency, the Ministry of Interior, and the Office of the First Deputy Prime Minister were hacked. No discern-ible damage was reported, so the nature of these intrusions was not very visible publicly. The primary repercussion of these intrusions on Bah-raini citizens seemed to be that during June, July, and August 2019, elec-tricity and water bills were tremendously higher than usual, leading to many citizens\u2019 complaints. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Doffman, 2019; Hope et al., 2019).\nThese cyberattacks and intrusions vary along two main dimensions: the method of the attacks and the type of target. The method of the attack ranges from hacking, hacking-and-leaking, hacking-and-faking, or covert disruption. The targets of the intrusions range from critical infrastructures (such as Saudi oil company Aramco) to governmental agencies (such as gov-ernment ministries) as well as national media channels (such as the Qatari national news agency). The vast difference between the cases is quite useful for identifying common and divergent rhetorical strategies used when facing a public cyber intrusion.\nDiscourse analysis\nOnce all our cases were identified, we moved to systematically collect discur-sive responses to these intrusions. First, we checked whether a specific intru-sion was reported in the state\u2019s newspapers and whether state officials responded to this intrusion. Second, we collected all statements that were issued by an official state figure. In each country, we surveyed the official websites of the relevant authorities as well as their Facebook and Twitter accounts. We also looked at widely-circulated and semiofficial newspapers known to reflect the government\u2019s approach (in Saudi Arabia\u2014al-Riadh and al-Madina; in Bahrain\u2014al-Bilad, al-Ayam; in Qatar\u2014al-Watan and al-Raya). In addition, we included additional Arabic news sources, such as\nAlarabiya Net, Al-Jazeera, and Bahrain Mirror looking for references for cyber intrusions.8 \n\tTo map the rhetorical strategies used in these texts, we employed abduc-tive methodological reasoning. As explained by Friedrichs and Kratochwil (2009), \u201c[i]nstead of trying to impose an abstract theoretical template (deduction) or \u2018simply\u2019 inferring propositions from facts (induction), we start reasoning at an intermediate level (abduction)\u201d (p. 709). This means that we moved back and forth between the categories already identified by\u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories and the empirical textual data at hand. On the one hand, we compared the textual data to exist-ing categories identified by the literature (e.g., \u201cbolstering\u201d or \u201cminimizing\u201d). On the other hand, we coded new categories based on the emerging data. The coding procedure involved two independent research assistants blind to each other coding. After coding one case, we had a collaborative meeting to refine the labels and continued coding independently all the other cases. Thus, our abductive method combined the deductive ascription of preexisting cat-egories with an inductive interpretation of the text. The full discursive data, which includes about 240 statements, appears in the supplemental material file.\nMessages are crafted to shape the opinion of a target audience. Looking at discourse in Arabic makes it difficult to determine which audience was tar-geted. While governments probably address their domestic audience, they also take into consideration regional Arab-speaking audiences. This is par-ticularly true in the Gulf context, where neighboring countries are involved in initiating the cyber intrusions described below. Official press conferences and announcements are also targeting international audiences, as English-speaking media picks up and translates government messages. Thus, our analysis cannot determine audience-related influences, and this aspect merits additional research.\n\u201cFace-saving\u201d strategies following public cyber intrusions\nBased on the discursive data, we can identify multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies used by Gulf countries following a public cyber intrusion. These can be classified under three broad categories: diminishing strategies, self-compli-menting strategies, and accusing strategies. These differ from one another in their object of focus (the attack, the state itself, or the initiator) and in the way they address the image-related needs of the state. Diminishing strat-egies reduce the impact and the seriousness of the intrusion itself. Self-com-plimenting strategies seek to portray the targeted state in a good and positive light. Accusing strategies direct the attention toward the initiator. Table 1 below summarizes the various strategies.9\nTable 1. Rhetorical strategies following a cyber intrusion.\nDiminishing strategies\nDiminishing strategies involve (1) minimizing the effect of the intrusion or (2) normalizing it as a routine part of international politics. In cases of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, another strategy manifests itself: (3) debunking\u2014claiming that the information is fabricated.\nFirst, states use a minimizing strategy to reduce the impact, magnitude, or scale of the incident, claiming that nothing serious has happened (\u201cit\u2019s not as bad as it seems\u201d). This strategy seeks to convince the audience that the incident is not significant and that no serious damage was incurred, thus reducing the damage to the state\u2019s image. For instance, following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, Maj. Gen. Al-Turki, organized a press conference, claiming that \u201cthe hacking attempt did not reach its goals\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Immediately after, the chairperson of the investigation committee and the deputy director-general of strategic plan-ning in Aramco added that despite some damage, \u201cthe attackers did not reach their intended goal \u2026 \u201d and that \u201cthere was no impact on the company\u2019s con-tinued oil and gas production\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Following the 2017 intru-sion using Shamoon 2.0, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture stated that \u201cour systems operate at full capacity and were not affected by that attacks of Shamoon 2.0 attacks and the ransomware virus\u201d(Okaz, 2017). To mitigate the public damage caused by planning fake infor-mation on the Qatari news website, Qatar\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs emphasized that \u201cthe cooperation between Qatar and the United States or any other friendly country was not affected\u201d (Qatar MFA, 2017f).\nSecond, states use a normalizing strategy to reduce the uniqueness of the event, framing it as a routine part of global politics (\u201cnothing is out of the ordinary\u201d). By claiming that other states experience cyber intrusions or that they happen all the time, this strategy de-individuates the targeted state (i.e., avoids signaling it out) and reduces some level of responsibility from the targeted state. In the case of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake intru-sions, states can claim that the information leaked does not reveal anything out of the ordinary. Following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the company stated that \u201cAramco is not the only company that was exposed to this type of operations, and this isn\u2019t the first nor the last time we\u2019ll see this type of attack\u201d (Al-Hawawi, 2012). In 2016, after the intrusion of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Al-Saadoun, the chairperson of the Security Affairs Committee in the Saudi Shura Council stated that: \u201cthe Kingdom is targeted the same as other countries, and all countries suffer from these attacks\u201d (Al-Turaisi, 2016). In Bahrain, a technology expert and a parliament member noted the fact that there are numerous intrusions all over the world and emphasized that even American companies lost money due to cyber intrusions (Al-Bilad, 2019).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake cyber intrusions, states can use a debunking strategy and claim that the information is fabri-cated (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d). When using this strategy, states will provide evidence that the information is untrue and will try to change the narrative to high-light their version of the truth. Debunking does not only involve disputing the content of the information but also preventing the dissemination of the information by issuing \u201cfake news\u201d warnings or even shutting down media channels (especially in more authoritarian settings). In the Qatari, Bahraini, and Saudi (2015) cases, official representatives issued statements emphasizing the leaks are fabricated (Al-Bilad, 2017; GCO, 2017; Qatar MFA, 2017b, 2017a; Saudi Arabia, MFA, 2015a, 2015b).\nOverall, diminishing strategies help protect the image of the targeted state by reducing the magnitude of the failure and trying to change beliefs regard-ing the responsibility of the targeted state. A minimization strategy seeks to convince the audience that the intrusion was not significant (hence, the state failure was not that bad). In addition to the domestic audience, this strategy can be also used to signal to the initiator that their intrusion did not achieve its goals. By employing these strategies, the victim aims to downplay poten-tial tensions and subtly communicate a message to the adversary. A normal-ization strategy seeks to convince the audience that cyber intrusions are a regular feature of international politics (hence, there is nothing uniquely wrong about the targeted state). A debunking strategy seeks to convince the audience that leaked information is wrong (hence, rectifying the image of the targeted state).\nSelf-complimenting strategies\nStates can use self-complimenting strategies to highlight their positive traits. They \u201cmitigate the negative effects of the act on the actor by strengthening the audience\u2019s positive affect for the actor\u201d (Benoit, 2014, p. 24). Specifically, our findings identify three such strategies. First, as image-repair theorists note, states can use a bolstering strategy to identify themselves \u201cwith some-thing viewed favorably by the audience\u201d (Ware & Linkugel, 1973, p. 277). In this strategy, states emphasize their successes, their international connec-tions, and their good values (\u201clook how good we are\u201d).\nIn several of our cases, the state officials emphasized their success in quickly blocking the intrusion or continuing their operations despite it. Some statements highlight that the state did so independently without help from external sources (Al-Ghamdi, 2012), while other statements emphasize how quick and efficient the state was in dealing with the intrusion or how many intrusions had been blocked before (Al-Arabiya, 2017; Al-Bilad, 2019; Al-Hawawi, 2012). Further, the statements often noted the good standing of the state within the international community and their\nability to secure international cooperation to investigate the intrusion (Al-Ghamdi, 2012; Qatar MFA, 2017c, 2017d, 2017e).\nSecond, states can assure the audience that measures have been taken to guarantee future protection. We label this strategy reasserting control as it involves a symbolic display of efforts showing that the government is com-mitted and well-functioning (\u201ceverything is under control\u201d). Our findings show that states repeatedly emphasized that they would investigate, establish new cyber institutions, and develop new cyber regulations. Further, in many cases, press conferences included specific and detailed technical explanations to signal authoritative and thorough knowledge regarding what happened. Qatar, which suffered a hack-and-fake intrusion, even produced an impress-ive and dramatic movie clip documenting the intrusion step-by-step. The image-related dimensions of this clip, broadcasted publicly during a press conference, are self-evident (Al-Shiyadhmi, 2017).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, states need to work \u201cuphill\u201d to correct the information that was leaked or faked. Thus, states use the strategy of correcting, which involves rebutting misinformation by providing an alternative and beneficial description of the \u201ctruth\u201d (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d). The goal of a correcting strategy is to replace the image cultivated by the leaked or fabricated infor-mation with a new\u2014more positive\u2014image. The correcting strategy was intensively used by Qatar following the planting of a fake news story on the QNA website. Qatari officials released statements emphasizing that\u201cthe relationship between Qatar and the United States is strong and strategic\u201dor that \u201cQatar has always maintained friendly relations with the Gulf States\u201d(Qatar MFA, 2017f;\ufeed\ufeaf\ufe8d\ufead\ufe93\ufe8d\ufedf\ufea8\ufe8e\ufead\ufe9f\ufef4\ufe94-\ufed7\ufec4\ufeae,2017 ). The correcting strategy was used only in the Qatari case. In this case, a lot of embarrassing information was published in a short time and it seems that choosing the correcting strat-egy was an efficient way for Qatar to mitigate the embarrassment.\nOverall, self-complimenting strategies aim to improve the image of the tar-geted states following a public cyber intrusion. A bolstering strategy seeks to shift the discussion to emphasize the positive traits of the targeted state. Reas-serting control seeks to convince the audience that the state is competent, capable, and manages the situation. As Shandler and Gomez (2022) show, cyber intrusions diminish public confidence in the government. Thus, reas-serting control aims to restore such confidence within the domestic public as well asinternational businesses. A correcting strategyseeks to present infor-mation in a way that will shed good light on the targeted state.\nAccusing strategies\nStates can adopt accusing strategies to denigrate the attacking state and cast it in a bad light. By accusing another actor, the state shifts the blame to the\nexternal actor and situates itself as a victim of bad behavior by others (Benoit, 2014, p. 25). We classify the sub-strategies following Finnemore and Hollis who identify three discrete processes (2020, p. 974).\nFirst, once the intrusion becomes public knowledge, states employ the strategy of exposing. They disclose what happened to third parties, acknowl-edging publicly that they have been attacked (\u201cwe have been attacked\u201d). In all of our cases, state officials issued brief statements admitting that there was an intrusion and providing general details about it. The degree of exposure was dependent on the degree of publicity the intrusion received. For instance, immediately after the Saudi 2015 intrusion, the Spokesperson of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Osama Bin Ahmed Nuqli, only stated that the MFA computer was hacked (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015a). About a month later, when Saudi documents were leaked, Nuqli issued a new statement con-necting the leaked documents to the earlier cyber intrusion (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015b).\nSecond, in addition to exposing the intrusion, states can engage in the strategy of condemning (\u201cthey are bullies\u201d), which is the process of signaling disapproval of what happened, delegitimizing it, and casting the other side in a bad light. Our findings demonstrate that states often use negative and dero-gatory labels to describe the cyber intrusion or its initiators, such as crime/ criminals, terrorism, enemies of the state, illegitimate actions, and shameful acts. This strategy was used by all states as well and was among the first ones to be used.\nThird, states can also ascribe the intrusion to a particular actor, a strategy known as attributing (\u201cthis is who did it\u201d). The vast literature on attribution highlights the technical, political, and social aspects related to attribution. While attribution can help states \u201cname and shame\u201d the initiator and address public demands for answers, there are also some incentives to eschew attribution, such as maintaining secrecy or strategic calculations (Borghard & Lonergan, 2019; Egloff, 2020b, 2020a; Rid & Buchanan, 2015).\nOverall, accusing strategies seek to shift audience perceptions regarding responsibility\u2014rather than focusing on the failure of the targeted state, these strategies seek to attribute responsibility to a malevolent actor. A second possible goal is norm-setting or norm-reinforcing. By denigrating the intrusion (and/or the initiator) the targeted state reproduces what is appropriate behavior in international politics (Egloff, 2020b; Egloff & Smeets, 2021). That said, harsh accusing strategies could potentially increase the risk of escalation (Egloff, 2020b).\nRhetorical strategies in practice\nIn addition to identifying the variety of strategies employed by the Gulf States following a public cyber intrusion, we can move on to offer some\nTable 2. Distribution of strategies per intrusion.\ngeneral insights regarding the practical use of these strategies. We find that the various strategies were used differently across our cases (table 2).\nOn the one hand, we find that exposing the intrusion, condemning it, and normalizing it were commonly used in all of our cases. Similarly, the rhetori-cal strategies of reasserting control following the intrusion and bolstering the image of the targeted state also appeared in all cases. This suggests that the Gulf countries are indeed sensitive to their image following a cyber intrusion and indicates that these strategies might serve as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of image management rhetoric. It could also suggest that there is a common repertoire of rhetorical strategies commonly used in the region (or internationally) fol-lowing a failure event. On the other hand, we find that hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions involve additional strategies that do not appear in other intrusions. Specifically, the strategies of debunking (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d) and correcting (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d) are uniquely used when private information is leaked or fake information is disseminated. This finding is also supported in the Saudi case, where the strategy of debunking primarily appeared after the Saudi Cables were released. It seems that this strategy is more useful when the fabricated information is already outed by others, and the victim states use it to minimize the reputa-tional damage in the fastest way possible\u2014by claiming it is a lie. Further, the strategy of minimizing was used in most cases except the Bahraini one. This can be explained by the fact that there was no visible damage in the Bahraini intrusion.\nWhen appeared, the strategy of attribution emerged relatively little in gov-ernment discourse. Interestingly, only in the Qatari and Bahraini cases, there was a clear public attribution directed at the UAE and Iran, respectively. However, in both cases, such attribution came only after an American source had already attributed the intrusion. It is plausible that Bahrain and\nQatar preferred to \u201cpass the buck,\u201d allowing the hegemon to publicly attri-bute the intrusion, minimizing the risk of escalation and retaliation. These findings resonate with recent works that claim that attribution is a political decision as well as a technical one. The rhetorical strategy of attribution did not appear in any of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrusions. This behavior might be explained by the Saudi\u2019s inclination not to risk escalation or compel the per-petrator to respond if attribution is publicly made. Since Saudi Arabia and Iran are in constant rivalry and share inspiration as regional powers, choos-ing the option of a public attribution strategy might have greater escalation risks compared to the cases of Qatar and Bahrain.\nIn terms of sequencing, we did not find a particular order in the appear-ance of rhetorical strategies. As can be seen in the supplementary file, early responses were relatively short and mainly included the strategies of expos-ing coupled with minimizing and normalizing.\nConclusions\nWhen thinking about the public response of states to public cyber intrusions, existing literature primarily discusses the risks of retaliation or escalation (Healey & Jervis, 2020; Libicki, 2020; Valeriano et al., 2018) as well as attri-bution (Egloff, 2020b; Rid & Buchanan, 2015). However, as this article shows, states engage in multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to manage their image and legitimize their restraint. Attribution is only one rhetorical option out of many.\nOur systematic discourse analysis of five cyber intrusions in Gulf states advances three findings. First, drawing partly on the conceptual language used by \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis-communication theories, the article cat-egorizes three broad \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies adopted by states following a public cyber intrusion: diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accusing strategies. Second, the results suggest that different contextual factors shape the specific strategies used. In cyber intrusions that involve leaking or faking information, unique strategies of debunking or correcting were used. Third, regarding attribution, the cases involving Saudi Arabia\u2014a regional power\u2014did not include public attribution. In contrast, Bahrain and Qatar\u2014smaller powers\u2014did attribute the intrusions but did so only after such attribution was made by American media. These suggestive contextual factors might be used in future research on the rhetoric of cyber responses in other areas.\nIt is important to acknowledge that our findings are not exhaustive and do not include all possible strategies. For instance, our focus on public cyber intrusion means that the strategies of silence (not responding at all) or denial (claiming that nothing happened) were not really usable strategies. Further, theoretically, states also have the option of apologizing to their\npublic for not preventing the intrusion. While apologizing might be con-sidered appropriate in some contexts (Aldar et al., 2021; Lind, 2011; N. L\u00f6wenheim, 2009),10it seems unlikely that a public apology by the targeted states would help mitigate any image-related costs. Instead, apologizing would probably be interpreted as an admission of failure and responsibility.\nThe discursive toolkit identified in this article is not necessarily unique to the Gulf countries. Israel, Albania, and the US\u2014different from the Gulf countries and each other in their regime type\u2014also employed similar strat-egies in response to cyber intrusions directed at them. For instance, after a cyber intrusion against Israel\u2019s water facilities in April 2020, Israeli officials employed the rhetorical strategies of minimizing and reasserting control, stating \u201c[t]he attempted attack was dealt with by the Water Authority and National Cyber Directorate. It should be emphasized that there was no harm to the water supply and it operated, and continues to operate, without interruption\u201d (TOI, 2020). Albania\u2019s response to the Iranian cyber-attack against its governmental systems in September 2022 also involved minimizing and reasserting control. In a video message, the Albanian Prime Minister stated that \u201cThe said attack failed its purpose. Damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor. All systems came back fully operational and there was no irreversible wiping of data\u201d (Republic of Albania, 2022). Both countries also used accusing strat-egies and attributed these intrusions to Iran.\nIn response to the data breach of the OPM in June 2015, The White House Press Secretary primarily employed the strategy of exposing and reasserting control, while avoiding attribution early on. It also used a normalizing strat-egy stating that \u201cto say that our computer systems in the federal government are at risk is not news \u2026 all of the computer networks on which we interact on a daily basis\u2014whether that\u2019s at work, or when we\u2019re checking our email, or purchasing an airline ticket\u2014that there is risk associated with that\u201d (The White House, 2015). In contrast, following the SolarWinds intrusion into United States government networks in December 2020 the White House added a new rhetorical strategy detailing the retaliatory measures taken against Russia (The White House, 2021)\u2014a strategy that can be classified under \u201cbolstering\u201d attempts.\nAdditional research is required in order to delve more into the conditions that explain variations in the rhetorical repertoire of states\u2014Under which conditions do states use silence compared to rhetoric in response to cyber intrusions? Under which conditions do states use some strategies and not others? And under which conditions do states engage in short, laconic mess-ages compared to detailed press conferences or engaging videos? Possible factors could be related to the type of attack, the extent of the damage, the attack\u2019s degree of publicity, the suspected initiator, and the strategic culture of the specific state. Moreover, while this research does not\nexamine the effectiveness of these rhetorical strategies, experimental social science can identify the micro-foundations that make some strategies more persuasive than others.\nThe rhetorical strategies presented here should not be seen as necessarily tied to the cyber context. For example, scholars on public relations have already examined the use of image-repair strategies by governments or indi-vidual leaders following health or environmental crises (Benoit & Henson, 2009; Chon & Kim, 2022; Zhang & Benoit, 2009). IR scholars can extend the framework suggested here to study how states deal with image-related damage caused by kinetic attacks. A quick look at how Israel discursively responded to incendiary kites fired from the Gaza Strip (causing forest and farmland fires in Israel) provides some preliminary suggestions.\nFirst, similar to the cyber context, accusation strategies also seem to appear in the Israeli response (labeling an intrusion as \u201cterrorism\u201d or an infringement of international law, identifying an actor, or condemning the act). Second, self-complimenting strategies also seem to appear in both con-texts but in different ways. For instance, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister used a bol-stering strategy emphasizing that 400 out of 600 kites were intercepted (Hay, 2018). However, Israel\u2019s rhetoric also pointed to its past reputation as a way to bolster its image as a deterring actor\u2014\u201cWe will act and exact a heavy price. We\u2019ve done it in the past. Remember that, because we will do it again now\u201d(Ahronheim et al., 2020). This rhetorical move of referencing the past was not found in our cases. Third, diminishing strategies, while extensively appearing in our findings, do not seem to be rhetorically prevalent in the Israeli response. These suggestive ideas imply that there might be important normative and socio-political differences in the ways states are expected to manage their image in the cyber vs. the kinetic spheres.\nIn sum, this article shows that in addition to covert technical and political strategies to deal with cyber intrusion, states engage in performative public strategies to manage their image. Identifying the various strategies directs our attention to the agency of states\u2014how targeted states perceive the context of the intrusion, interpret it, and narrate it. Diminishing the magni-tude of a cyber intrusion, complimenting the successes of the Self, and accus-ing the adversary of bad behavior allows states to mitigate image-related costs in front of a domestic and international audience and perform their role as ontological security providers (Lupovici, 2023). \u201cFace-saving\u201d strat-egies are the bread and butter of international society\u2014justifications, apolo-gies, rejections, or acknowledgments\u2014are some of the ways states resolve tensions, legitimize their behavior, and reinforce or contest norms. In the case of public cyber intrusions, these rhetorical strategies narrate the intru-sion, justify the lack of retaliation, and potentially facilitate the de-securitiza-tion of the event.\nNotes\n1. Hack-and-leak operations are defined as \u201can intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak).\u201d Hack-and-fake operations are similarly defined but they involve the public fabrication of information. See Shires, 2019.\n2. For the bigger question of whether cyber capabilities are escalatory, see Bor-\tghard & Lonergan, 2019; Healey & Jervis, 2020.\n3. A similar point is made with regard to countries\u2019 failure to deter (especially when these countries see themselves as deterring actors). Their inability to prevent a challenger damages their sense of Self (Fettweis, 2013; Lupovici, 2016b).\n4. In contrast to shame, which is associated with \u201cperceived deficiencies of one\u2019s core self,\u201d embarrassment is associated with \u201cdeficiencies in one\u2019s presented self.\u201d Thus, shame is a more enduring sense of negative self-evaluation, while embarrassment is tied to more transient, situation-specific failures and pratfalls\u201d(Tangney et al., 1996, p. 1258; cf. Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). Humiliation is under-stood as \u201cas an act of extreme disrespect that intends to deprive an actor of its status as an autonomous agent that counts\u201d (Wolf, 2017, p. 494). It is a result of the actions of another (rather than a failure of the Self) (Lupovici, 2016b, p. 66). 5. The targeted states can also leak information to encourage external actors to reveal the intrusion.\n6. In addition to rhetorical strategies, states also develop legal and institutional \tresponses, see Shires, 2021b.\n7. The datasets we use did not contain any cyber incidents involving the UAE that met our inclusion criteria\u2014such as a range of years, a public response that can be examined in more detail, etc.\n8. We specifically examined the dates in which cyber intrusions were revealed as \twell as key terms in Arabic, such as cyber, hacking, and electronic attack. 9. The impact of these strategies is beyond the scope of this paper.\n10. However, states can also refuse to apologize to protect their identity, see \tZarakol, 2010.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Or Greif, Noya Peer, and Jason Silverman for valuable research assistance, and James Shires and Tarek Tutunji for commenting on previous drafts.

Recent scholarship demonstrates that the covert nature of cyber intrusions allows states to respond with restraint, avoiding escalation. But what happens when cyber intrusions become public and are highly visible? This article examines the rhetorical strategies employed by authoritarian Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs associated with a public cyber intrusion. Drawing on the conceptual language of image-repair and crisis communication theories and employing discourse analysis of original data in Arabic, we identify three types of face-saving strategies: diminishing, self-complimenting, and accusing. Our findings indicate that intrusions involving leaking or faking information bring about unique \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies that do not only deal with the intrusion itself but also with the subsequent information crisis. Overall, the article identifies how states employ diverse rhetorical strategies\u2014beyond attribution\u2014to narrate cyber intrusions and keep cyber conflict contained.\nKEYWORDS Cybersecurity; Middle East; constructivism; image; discourse analysis\nIn July 2017, nearly two months after Qatar had suffered a cyber intrusion,\nthe Qatari Ministry of Interior (MOI) held a press conference to reveal evi-\ndence concerning the intrusion. Rather than only providing technical details,\nthe MOI broadcasted a dramatic video with intense music, thrilling graphics,\nand a spy-style vibe to reveal the intrusion step-by-step (Qatar MOI, 2017).\nIn addition to delegitimizing cyber intrusions as acts of terrorism, the video\nemphasized the Qatari remarkable success in containing the intrusion and\ndetecting its source despite the intrusion\u2019s sophistication.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The terms on which this article has been published allow the posting of the Accepted Manuscript in a repository by the author(s) or with their consent.\nThe Qatari press conference is not unique. When cyber intrusions become public knowledge, states do not only engage in technical strategies to block the intrusion and identify the initiator, but also manage their public relations\u2014they publish messages, hold press conferences, brief reporters, and rhetori-cally try to manage this crisis. These performative, social, and symbolic strat-egies are often left unnoticed in existing research on cyber discourse. While extant studies examine different elements in the discursive construction of cyberspace, threats, and responses (e.g., Branch, 2019; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2017), we know less about the narration of cyber intrusions after they had happened. Of course, many studies zoom-in on the discourse of attribution or credit-claiming by the initiators (e.g., Brown & Fazal, 2021; Egloff, 2020a, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a; Poznansky & Perkoski, 2018), but as this article demonstrates, there is much more going on discursively following cyber intrusions.\n\tThis article explores the rhetorical strategies used by governments in response to a public cyber intrusion they suffered. In addition to obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted, protecting intelligence sources or technical capabilities, and identifying the initiator, we suggest that states employ rhetori-cal strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect their public image in front of domestic, regional, or international audiences. Drawing on two scholarly traditions\u2014the sociology of accounts and apologies (Benoit, 2014; Schlenker, 1980; Scott & Lyman, 1968) and self-presentation theories (Goffman, 1959)\u2014the article maps and categorizes the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf countries to narrate the public cyber intrusion and manage their public impression. We do so via an original discourse analysis of official statements and state-spon-sored media reports in five cyber intrusions that differ in their targets and methods: Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to cyber intrusion against its oil company Aramco (\u201cShamoon,\u201d August 2012), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusion (May-June 2015), Saudi Arabia\u2019s response to intrusions using \u201cShamoon 2.0\u201d malware (November 2016-January 2017), Qatar\u2019s response to a \u201chack-and-fake\u201d intrusion (May 2017), and Bahrain\u2019s response to multiple hacking operations (July-August 2019).1 \n\tExamining the strategies used by these states to \u201csave face\u201d is important for two reasons. Empirically, these strategies are a crucial stepping-stone to understanding the restraint and the limited nature of cyber conflicts. Existing International Relations (IR) scholarship focuses on the operational aspects of offensive cyber operations (OCOs), showing that targeted states practice restraint in their response to cyber intrusions, and that escalation is not a common practice (Fischerkeller et al., 2022, pp. 130\u2013141; Gartzke, 2013; Jacobsen, 2021; Kaminska, 2021; Lindsay, 2013; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).2However, we have little knowledge of how that restraint is legiti-mized, justified, and buttressed publicly. As Steele (2019) argues, in addition to systemic considerations, normative commitments, or institutional\nconstraints, restraint needs to be strategically narrated. When cyber intru-sions go public\u2014such as in the cases below\u2014targeted states employ \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to contain the crisis and avoid escalation. In light of research that emphasizes the importance of public attitudes toward retalia-tion against cyber intrusions (Hedgecock & Sukin, 2023; Kreps & Schneider, 2019), the rhetorical strategies described below can be used to reduce pressure to retaliate as well as to justify why retaliation is not necessary. In the broader discussion about the possibilities for de-securitizing cyber intru-sions, the content of the rhetoric described below can be seen as an attempt to \u201clower the cyber rhetoric and hyperbole\u201d or \u201ctone down\u201d its existential dimensions (Burton & Lain, 2020, pp. 462\u2013463).\nTheoretically, our findings broaden constructivist scholarship on the repertoire of strategies used by states to cope with image-related damage. Existing works on stigma, shaming, and wrongdoing examine how states respond to accusations regarding their normative transgressions, and how they deal with the harm to their image and identity\u2014employing strategies of avoidance, rejection, acceptance, or containment (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). In contrast, this article analyzes a different type of image-related harm, caused by being vul-nerable. Doing so, allows us to uncover additional micro-strategies used by states to manage their images. Thus, the empirical findings from the cyber context can serve as a starting point to explore \u201cface-saving\u201d discourse in other contexts of perceived state failures\u2014inability to deal with an environ-mental disaster, a health crisis, or even in response to some kinetic attacks. We discuss these possibilities in the concluding section.\nThe Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regard-ing face-saving rhetoric in the cyber context. These countries are particularly concerned about their domestic and international image and they tie this image to their level of technological development (Hertog & Luciani, 2011, p. 248; Shires, 2021b, p. 27). Further, focusing on the Gulf countries sheds light on a non-Western cyber conflict context and underscores the agency of states located in the Global South to publicly interpret cyber intrusions in front of domestic, regional, and international audiences.\nWe begin by situating this study within the intersection of cyber conflict and impression management. Building on existing literature on offensive cyber operations, we suggest that public, visible, and high-profile cyber intrusions might be perceived by domestic and international audiences as embarrassing to the targeted states. To manage this public impression, states adopt \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies intended to mitigate the harm to the state\u2019s image. Following a methodological section detailing our procedure for discourse analysis, the article introduces a typology of \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies drawing partly on the conceptual language of \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). We find that Gulf countries have a repertoire\nof strategies\u2014diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accus-ing strategies\u2014used to narrate the intrusion. Specifically, our discourse analy-sis shows that intrusions that involved faking or leaking information included additional rhetorical strategies than intrusions that involved hacking alone. We conclude our discussion by suggesting how our findings can travel beyond the cyber domain and the Gulf region.\nCyber intrusions and image costs\nOur research question\u2014how do states \u201csave face\u201d following a public cyber intrusion that they suffered\u2014rests on the assumption that the publicity of the intrusion entails image-related costs. First, when a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge (i.e., exposed by the media, the initiators, or third-party actors), it reveals the targeted state\u2019s shortcomings and vulner-abilities. It publicly shows the targeted state\u2019s incompetence to prevent or block an intrusion and its failure to guarantee security for its government offices, critical infrastructure, citizens, or investors. In addition to technical reasons and intelligence concerns (Broeders et al., 2019; Riemer, 2021), states\u2019 inability to block or prevent a cyber intrusion might be experienced (or at least seen by others) as damaging their self-image.3 \n\tThe existing literature on cyber conflict already points to these image-related costs faced by targeted states. Rid (2012) suggests that there are incen-tives for governments and firms to keep cyber intrusion secret \u201clest they would expose their vulnerabilities and damage their reputation as a place for secure investment\u201d (pp. 28\u201329). Waxman (2013) claims that targeted states \u201cmay be reluctant to disclose details or even the very existence of cyberattacks, whether to protect secrets about their vulnerabilities and defenses, prevent public panic, avoid political embarrassment, or escape unwanted domestic pressure to take retaliatory actions\u201d (p. 119). Libicki (2012) explains that targeted states might say nothing in response to a cyber intrusion because it would require them to \u201cadmit that their machines and they, by extension, were conned,\u201d and because \u201cthere is no pride involved in being a victim\u201d (p. 45). While in some cases, targeted states prefer to disclose the fact that they have been attacked (for instance, to justify retaliation), existing data show that targeted states often choose not to do so (Baram & Sommer, 2019).\nSecond, some cyber intrusions purposefully seek to embarrass the target by revealing sensitive data, government secrets, intimate details, or even planting \u201cfake news\u201d (Kostyuk & Zhukov, 2019, p. 320; Lindsay, 2015, pp. 56\u201357; Nye, 2017, p. 48; Sharp, 2017; Shuya, 2018, p. 11). This intensifies the concern for the state image\u2014not only that the initiator successfully pene-trated supposedly protected computer systems, but it also manipulated sen-sitive information or exposed private information to the public. Leaking\nsensitive information often reveals a gap between the government\u2019s state-ments and its practice or reveals governmental wrongdoing that the govern-ment was trying to hide. Indeed, Shires (2020) conceptualizes \u201chack-and-leak\u201d intrusions as a simulation of a scandal aimed to embarrass the target.\nPublic discourse also reproduces the perception that being attacked in cyberspace damages the state\u2019s image. For instance, successful intrusions into the websites or services of government agencies are described as \u201cembar-rassing\u201d or \u201chumiliating\u201d (Ashkenaz, 2022; Bob, 2022; Kahan, 2020; Kalman, 2011). Referring to the theft of US government workers\u2019 data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), attributed to China, Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA, reflected on the US image, noting:\u201cThis is not \u2018shame on China.\u2019 This is \u2018shame on us\u2019 for not protecting that kind of information\u201d (Paletta, 2015). Following the hack of the British Army social media accounts, a UK parliament member claimed it was\u201cembarrassing\u201d (Clinton, 2022). As the literature on emotions and IR argues, these various affective modes\u2014shame, humiliation, or embarrass-ment\u2014have undesirable implications for states\u2019 sense of Self and how they are seen by significant others (Lupovici, 2016b, pp. 66\u201369; Subotic & Zarakol, 2013).4Anecdotally, the term \u201cp0wned\u201d is used in hackers\u2019 slang to signal humiliation\u2014being defeated or controlled by someone else.\nThe understanding that states are concerned about their image and that image-related concerns matter for conflict escalation is not new to IR literature. Several studies indicate that humiliating or embarrassing an opponent might magnify pressures to retaliate due to the psychological fea-tures of specific leaders, public demands, or concerns regarding the inter-national image of the state (Carson, 2016; Masterson, 2022; Wolf, 2011; Yarhi-Milo, 2018). Another line of research elaborates on the \u201cface work\u201demployed by states to mitigate embarrassment, shame, or guilt. For instance, in response to international accusations regarding normative transgressions, states use strategies such as apologizing, counter-shaming, or containing in order to protect the damage to their image (Adler-Nissen, 2014; Haugevik & Neumann, 2021; Kampf & L\u00f6wenheim, 2012; Lind, 2011; O. L\u00f6wenheim & Heimann, 2008; Snyder, 2020). A public cyber intrusion brings about an ana-lytically different challenge to the state\u2019s image, similar to the one felt when admitting a failure or an injury.\nWhen a cyber intrusion becomes public knowledge, states need to miti-gate these image-related costs by narrating the event. As the broader research agenda linking constructivist IR to cybersecurity highlights, cyber intrusions are not merely technical phenomena but socio-political ones that are inter-subjectively interpreted. For instance, several studies trace how cyber-related discourse (e.g., representations, metaphors, and analogies but also non-textual practices) constitutes cyberspace as a domain, frames particular policy problems and solutions, and forges links between cyber, security, or\nrisks (Branch, 2019; Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, 2013; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009; Jarvis et al., 2014). Similarly, attribution, rather than being a purely technical process, is a socially managed one that instills meaning in an uncertain cyber intrusion (Egloff, 2020b; Lupovici, 2016a). Moreover, cyber intrusions might challenge states\u2019 ability to function as ontological security providers. Such intrusions may challenge the state\u2019s role to serve as a secure space for the nation (Lupovici, 2023). Thus, public and visible cyber intrusions require states to craft symbolic and per-formative strategies to \u201csave face\u201d\u2014to protect or enhance their image, perform as security providers, and avoid the unease associated with the intrusion. In addition to other goals, such as obscuring the extent of the damage inflicted or repairing diplomatic relations with the potential initiator, targeted states need to address, explain, and narrate what happened. The following section discusses these strategies.\nResponding to public cyber intrusions\nWhen cyber intrusions remain covert (not publicly known or exposed), they take place \u201cbackstage\u201d without much public audience. In such cases, targeted states can choose to remain silent\u2014concealing the fact that they have been attacked, avoiding public embarrassment altogether, and removing the need to employ a rhetorical strategy. For instance, several successful hacking oper-ations by CopyKittens\u2014a cyber espionage group associated with Iran\u2014were never reported in the mainstream Arab media. Despite the successful extrac-tion of a large amount of government and military data in Saudi Arabia and the exposure of the intrusion by private cyber companies, the Saudi govern-ment never disclosed that such an intrusion took place.\nWhen cyber intrusions have visible consequences, such as damage to the global oil supply, a massive leak of data, or a kinetic impact, it is harder for states to remain silent. In these moments, states can seize the inherent ambi-guity and the lack of details to deny that there was any intrusion. For instance, states can claim that a technical malfunction or an accident hap-pened, thus suggesting that the incident was out of their control. For example, the cyber intrusion that caused a major power outage at the Natanz nuclear facility in April 2021, was first described by Iran as an \u201cacci-dent\u201d (Coulter, 2021).\nThese two strategies\u2014staying silent or denying a cyber intrusion took place\u2014are not always viable. Cyber intrusions sometimes become public knowledge when they are exposed by external actors or by the targeted state itself.5In such moments, states need to face domestic, regional, and international audiences and explain why were they targeted, why was the intrusion successful, and what measures have been taken to address the situ-ation. In other words, states engage in \u201cremedial self-presentation\u201d\n(Schlenker & Darby, 1981) to narrate their failure and cast themselves in a less negative light.6 \n\tTo identify these rhetorical strategies, we draw on literature focusing on\u201cImage Repair\u201d and Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) (Benoit, 2014; Coombs, 1998). These works primarily examine the strategies used by corporations to repair their reputations following a crisis. By releas-ing official statements, organizing press conferences, conducting interviews, and sending messages to the public, corporate officials engage in rhetorical strategies aimed at framing the crisis in a certain way and protecting the cor-poration\u2019s reputation in front of multiple audiences. These strategies involve denial (\u201cthe event did not happen\u201d), evading responsibility (\u201cthe event was accidental\u201d), reducing offensiveness (\u201cthe event was not that bad\u201d or\u201cdespite the event, we are so good\u201d), mortification (\u201cwe apologize for the event\u201d), and corrective action (\u201cwe are taking steps to prevent future similar events\u201d) (Benoit, 2014, pp. 22\u201329).\nTranslating these insights to the cyber realm, we expect the choice of rhe-torical strategy to depend on the kind of event. Specifically, intrusions that involve leaking sensitive information or spreading fake rumors might be par-ticularly damaging to the state\u2019s image. Not only that targeted states have to deal with the intrusion itself but they also need to address the scandal regard-ing the leaked or falsified information (Shires, 2020). In these cases, we expect to find intense rhetorical strategies addressing the leaked or falsified information. Drawing on the conceptual language of \u201cimage repair\u201d and crisis communication theories, this article employs original discourse analy-sis to identify the rhetorical strategies used by Gulf states to mitigate the image-related costs caused by a publicly visible cyber intrusion and when they use each. To do so, we use an abductive methodological approach as detailed in the following section.\nMethodology\nCase-selection\nOur analytical approach to studying states\u2019 discursive responses to cyber intrusions follows several steps. The research question, which focuses on governments\u2019 rhetorical responses, led us to focus only on intrusions that targeted government agencies or critical infrastructure within a country. Intrusion that targeted non-state actors, commercial companies, or societal organization were not studied. We further limited the universe of cases to include only cyber intrusions that took place in the Gulf countries for three main reasons. First, in general, cyber interactions tend to be of regional character and the Middle East has been known as one of the most active regions in terms of cyber activity (Valeriano & Maness, 2015, p. 129).\nHowever, the Gulf countries share unique features that distinguish them from other countries in the region both domestically and in relation to cyber conflict (Shires, 2018, p. 34). The exclusion of other countries in the region is also useful to limit the comparison to relatively similar political systems and patterns of civil-society relations.\nSecond, the Gulf countries are particularly useful for theory development regarding \u201csaving face\u201d strategies. These countries have been known to be particularly occupied with their domestic and international image. Their pol-itical economic strategy is significantly based on projecting a strong, innova-tive, and technologically modern image abroad (Cooke, 2014; Gray, 2016; Kamrava, 2013). In addition, their neo-patrimonial and authoritarian char-acter means that domestic political rule is based on fostering an image of strong leadership, maintaining a high degree of control over information, and silencing criticism in order to sustain regime legitimacy (Dukalskis, 2021; Gray, 2011, p. 7; Khatib & Maziad, 2019, p. 9).\nThird, most of the scholarly and policy debate about cyber conflict has focused on Russia, China, and the United States as well as the challenges posed by North Korea and Iran (Buchanan & Cunningham, 2020; Farwell & Rohozinski, 2011; Lindsay et al., 2015; Shackelford et al., 2017). Little attention has been paid to the Arab world compared to other regions (For an exception, see Shires, 2021b). Similarly, most works on cyber intrusions rely on English sources. Instead, we analyze original documents in Arabic to study how state elites mediate cyber intrusion to their public.\nTo identify the relevant cyber intrusions, we built an original dataset of Arabic sources using the general framework of the Dyadic Cyber Incident Dataset (DCID) version 1.1 as a baseline and added data for the years 2010\u20132019, based on the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker dataset. We included only intrusions that were verified by two cred-ible and reliable sources (such as cybersecurity companies\u2019 reports as well as media reports such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and more). Overall, our data includes the following five cases:7\n(1) Cyber intrusion on the Saudi oil company Aramco (Shamoon, August 2012): On August 15, 2012, Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil and gas firm\u2014and the world\u2019s largest oil producer\u2014Saudi Aramco, suffered a major cyberattack that infected more than 35,000 computers in the company\u2019s network. The incident was first revealed on Pastebin by a message from a hacking group named \u201cCutting Sword of Justice\u201d (Weitzenkorn, 2012). Later that day, Aramco\u2019s Facebook page posted an English message noting that the company had isolated its systems as a precautionary measure due to a network disruption caused by a virus (Lennon, 2012). Despite its vast resources, Saudi Aramco took almost two weeks to recover from the attack and restore the damage (Bronk &\nTikk-Ringas, 2013). The malware that was used for this attack, called Shamoon and revealed by the Russian-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky, erased data on three-quarters of Aramco\u2019s corporate PCs\u2014documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, files, and more. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Perlroth, 2012).\n(2) Hack-and-leak intrusion in Saudi Arabia (May-June 2015): On May 20, 2015, as a Saudi-led coalition was conducting airstrikes in Yemen, the\u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d announced that they had hacked several Saudi ministries in \u201cOperation Hussein Badreddin Al-Houthi,\u201d named after the deceased leader of the Houthi armed movement in Yemen. The group declared they had gained \u201cfull control\u201d of over 3,000 computers and servers belonging to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign, Interior, and Defense Ministries (Fars News Agency, 2015). They also released nearly 2,000 internal emails, documents, and information about citizens and person-nel of the Saudi MFA (Paganini, 2015) In the following weeks, additional documents have been released and the group even threatened to wipe the MFA\u2019s computers automatically. Finally, on June 19th,2015, Wiki-Leaks released \u201cThe Saudi Cables\u201d partially based on the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u2019s\u201d hack (WikiLeaks, 2015). It has been estimated that Iran stands behind the \u201cYemen Cyber Army\u201d (Franceschi-Bicchierai, 2015), although others have argued that this group is used as a front for the Russian group Sofacy (Bartholomew & Guerrero-Saade, 2016).\n(3) Shamoon 2.0 in Saudi Arabia (November 2016-January 2017): At the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, Saudi Arabia suffered another major cyberattack, with similar characteristics to the 2012 one. These intrusions were publicly revealed by several US security firms (e.g., CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Symantec) (Finkle & Wagstaff, 2016). Thousands of computers were damaged at the headquarters of the General Authority of Civil Aviation starting in mid-November, erasing critical data and bringing operations to a halt for several days (Riley et al., 2016). Another victim of this attack was the Jubail-based Sadara Chemical Co, a joint venture firm owned by Saudi Aramco and U.S. company Dow Chemical. In this case, too, cybersecurity researchers estimated Iran was the initiator of the attack (Williams, 2017).\n(4) Hack-and-fake intrusion in Qatar (May-June 2017): On May 24, 2017, the Qatari News Agency\u2019s (QNA) website, Twitter, and YouTube accounts published false statements allegedly made by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The false statements\u2014focused on Qatar\u2019s foreign policy\u2014served as a pretext for a broader diplomatic crisis. Despite repeated Qatari statements that the information was fabricated,\nmedia outlets in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia engaged in a \u201csustained medial onslaught\u201d against Qatar (Fattah, 2017; Ulrichsen, 2017). Further, only a few days after the incident, on June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the U.A.E. (\u201cThe Quartet\u201d) severed diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, withdrew their nationals, and issued a travel ban on Qatar (Mitchell, 2021; Soubrier et al., 2021). While IP address data pointed to Russia, additional information and investigation pointed to the UAE as a more likely initiator (Shires, 2021a).\n(5) Series of cyber intrusions in Bahrain (July-August 2019): In July-August 2019, Bahraini authorities detected and reported that several networks of Bahrain\u2019s government agencies, including the Electricity and Water Authority, the National Security Agency, the Ministry of Interior, and the Office of the First Deputy Prime Minister were hacked. No discern-ible damage was reported, so the nature of these intrusions was not very visible publicly. The primary repercussion of these intrusions on Bah-raini citizens seemed to be that during June, July, and August 2019, elec-tricity and water bills were tremendously higher than usual, leading to many citizens\u2019 complaints. It was estimated that Iran was the initiator of this attack (Doffman, 2019; Hope et al., 2019).\nThese cyberattacks and intrusions vary along two main dimensions: the method of the attacks and the type of target. The method of the attack ranges from hacking, hacking-and-leaking, hacking-and-faking, or covert disruption. The targets of the intrusions range from critical infrastructures (such as Saudi oil company Aramco) to governmental agencies (such as gov-ernment ministries) as well as national media channels (such as the Qatari national news agency). The vast difference between the cases is quite useful for identifying common and divergent rhetorical strategies used when facing a public cyber intrusion.\nDiscourse analysis\nOnce all our cases were identified, we moved to systematically collect discur-sive responses to these intrusions. First, we checked whether a specific intru-sion was reported in the state\u2019s newspapers and whether state officials responded to this intrusion. Second, we collected all statements that were issued by an official state figure. In each country, we surveyed the official websites of the relevant authorities as well as their Facebook and Twitter accounts. We also looked at widely-circulated and semiofficial newspapers known to reflect the government\u2019s approach (in Saudi Arabia\u2014al-Riadh and al-Madina; in Bahrain\u2014al-Bilad, al-Ayam; in Qatar\u2014al-Watan and al-Raya). In addition, we included additional Arabic news sources, such as\nAlarabiya Net, Al-Jazeera, and Bahrain Mirror looking for references for cyber intrusions.8 \n\tTo map the rhetorical strategies used in these texts, we employed abduc-tive methodological reasoning. As explained by Friedrichs and Kratochwil (2009), \u201c[i]nstead of trying to impose an abstract theoretical template (deduction) or \u2018simply\u2019 inferring propositions from facts (induction), we start reasoning at an intermediate level (abduction)\u201d (p. 709). This means that we moved back and forth between the categories already identified by\u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis communication theories and the empirical textual data at hand. On the one hand, we compared the textual data to exist-ing categories identified by the literature (e.g., \u201cbolstering\u201d or \u201cminimizing\u201d). On the other hand, we coded new categories based on the emerging data. The coding procedure involved two independent research assistants blind to each other coding. After coding one case, we had a collaborative meeting to refine the labels and continued coding independently all the other cases. Thus, our abductive method combined the deductive ascription of preexisting cat-egories with an inductive interpretation of the text. The full discursive data, which includes about 240 statements, appears in the supplemental material file.\nMessages are crafted to shape the opinion of a target audience. Looking at discourse in Arabic makes it difficult to determine which audience was tar-geted. While governments probably address their domestic audience, they also take into consideration regional Arab-speaking audiences. This is par-ticularly true in the Gulf context, where neighboring countries are involved in initiating the cyber intrusions described below. Official press conferences and announcements are also targeting international audiences, as English-speaking media picks up and translates government messages. Thus, our analysis cannot determine audience-related influences, and this aspect merits additional research.\n\u201cFace-saving\u201d strategies following public cyber intrusions\nBased on the discursive data, we can identify multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies used by Gulf countries following a public cyber intrusion. These can be classified under three broad categories: diminishing strategies, self-compli-menting strategies, and accusing strategies. These differ from one another in their object of focus (the attack, the state itself, or the initiator) and in the way they address the image-related needs of the state. Diminishing strat-egies reduce the impact and the seriousness of the intrusion itself. Self-com-plimenting strategies seek to portray the targeted state in a good and positive light. Accusing strategies direct the attention toward the initiator. Table 1 below summarizes the various strategies.9\nTable 1. Rhetorical strategies following a cyber intrusion.\nDiminishing strategies\nDiminishing strategies involve (1) minimizing the effect of the intrusion or (2) normalizing it as a routine part of international politics. In cases of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, another strategy manifests itself: (3) debunking\u2014claiming that the information is fabricated.\nFirst, states use a minimizing strategy to reduce the impact, magnitude, or scale of the incident, claiming that nothing serious has happened (\u201cit\u2019s not as bad as it seems\u201d). This strategy seeks to convince the audience that the incident is not significant and that no serious damage was incurred, thus reducing the damage to the state\u2019s image. For instance, following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior, Maj. Gen. Al-Turki, organized a press conference, claiming that \u201cthe hacking attempt did not reach its goals\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Immediately after, the chairperson of the investigation committee and the deputy director-general of strategic plan-ning in Aramco added that despite some damage, \u201cthe attackers did not reach their intended goal \u2026 \u201d and that \u201cthere was no impact on the company\u2019s con-tinued oil and gas production\u201d (Al-Ghamdi, 2012). Following the 2017 intru-sion using Shamoon 2.0, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture stated that \u201cour systems operate at full capacity and were not affected by that attacks of Shamoon 2.0 attacks and the ransomware virus\u201d(Okaz, 2017). To mitigate the public damage caused by planning fake infor-mation on the Qatari news website, Qatar\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs emphasized that \u201cthe cooperation between Qatar and the United States or any other friendly country was not affected\u201d (Qatar MFA, 2017f).\nSecond, states use a normalizing strategy to reduce the uniqueness of the event, framing it as a routine part of global politics (\u201cnothing is out of the ordinary\u201d). By claiming that other states experience cyber intrusions or that they happen all the time, this strategy de-individuates the targeted state (i.e., avoids signaling it out) and reduces some level of responsibility from the targeted state. In the case of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake intru-sions, states can claim that the information leaked does not reveal anything out of the ordinary. Following the 2012 intrusion on Aramco, the company stated that \u201cAramco is not the only company that was exposed to this type of operations, and this isn\u2019t the first nor the last time we\u2019ll see this type of attack\u201d (Al-Hawawi, 2012). In 2016, after the intrusion of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abdullah Al-Saadoun, the chairperson of the Security Affairs Committee in the Saudi Shura Council stated that: \u201cthe Kingdom is targeted the same as other countries, and all countries suffer from these attacks\u201d (Al-Turaisi, 2016). In Bahrain, a technology expert and a parliament member noted the fact that there are numerous intrusions all over the world and emphasized that even American companies lost money due to cyber intrusions (Al-Bilad, 2019).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak or hack-and-fake cyber intrusions, states can use a debunking strategy and claim that the information is fabri-cated (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d). When using this strategy, states will provide evidence that the information is untrue and will try to change the narrative to high-light their version of the truth. Debunking does not only involve disputing the content of the information but also preventing the dissemination of the information by issuing \u201cfake news\u201d warnings or even shutting down media channels (especially in more authoritarian settings). In the Qatari, Bahraini, and Saudi (2015) cases, official representatives issued statements emphasizing the leaks are fabricated (Al-Bilad, 2017; GCO, 2017; Qatar MFA, 2017b, 2017a; Saudi Arabia, MFA, 2015a, 2015b).\nOverall, diminishing strategies help protect the image of the targeted state by reducing the magnitude of the failure and trying to change beliefs regard-ing the responsibility of the targeted state. A minimization strategy seeks to convince the audience that the intrusion was not significant (hence, the state failure was not that bad). In addition to the domestic audience, this strategy can be also used to signal to the initiator that their intrusion did not achieve its goals. By employing these strategies, the victim aims to downplay poten-tial tensions and subtly communicate a message to the adversary. A normal-ization strategy seeks to convince the audience that cyber intrusions are a regular feature of international politics (hence, there is nothing uniquely wrong about the targeted state). A debunking strategy seeks to convince the audience that leaked information is wrong (hence, rectifying the image of the targeted state).\nSelf-complimenting strategies\nStates can use self-complimenting strategies to highlight their positive traits. They \u201cmitigate the negative effects of the act on the actor by strengthening the audience\u2019s positive affect for the actor\u201d (Benoit, 2014, p. 24). Specifically, our findings identify three such strategies. First, as image-repair theorists note, states can use a bolstering strategy to identify themselves \u201cwith some-thing viewed favorably by the audience\u201d (Ware & Linkugel, 1973, p. 277). In this strategy, states emphasize their successes, their international connec-tions, and their good values (\u201clook how good we are\u201d).\nIn several of our cases, the state officials emphasized their success in quickly blocking the intrusion or continuing their operations despite it. Some statements highlight that the state did so independently without help from external sources (Al-Ghamdi, 2012), while other statements emphasize how quick and efficient the state was in dealing with the intrusion or how many intrusions had been blocked before (Al-Arabiya, 2017; Al-Bilad, 2019; Al-Hawawi, 2012). Further, the statements often noted the good standing of the state within the international community and their\nability to secure international cooperation to investigate the intrusion (Al-Ghamdi, 2012; Qatar MFA, 2017c, 2017d, 2017e).\nSecond, states can assure the audience that measures have been taken to guarantee future protection. We label this strategy reasserting control as it involves a symbolic display of efforts showing that the government is com-mitted and well-functioning (\u201ceverything is under control\u201d). Our findings show that states repeatedly emphasized that they would investigate, establish new cyber institutions, and develop new cyber regulations. Further, in many cases, press conferences included specific and detailed technical explanations to signal authoritative and thorough knowledge regarding what happened. Qatar, which suffered a hack-and-fake intrusion, even produced an impress-ive and dramatic movie clip documenting the intrusion step-by-step. The image-related dimensions of this clip, broadcasted publicly during a press conference, are self-evident (Al-Shiyadhmi, 2017).\nThird, in the context of hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions, states need to work \u201cuphill\u201d to correct the information that was leaked or faked. Thus, states use the strategy of correcting, which involves rebutting misinformation by providing an alternative and beneficial description of the \u201ctruth\u201d (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d). The goal of a correcting strategy is to replace the image cultivated by the leaked or fabricated infor-mation with a new\u2014more positive\u2014image. The correcting strategy was intensively used by Qatar following the planting of a fake news story on the QNA website. Qatari officials released statements emphasizing that\u201cthe relationship between Qatar and the United States is strong and strategic\u201dor that \u201cQatar has always maintained friendly relations with the Gulf States\u201d(Qatar MFA, 2017f;\ufeed\ufeaf\ufe8d\ufead\ufe93\ufe8d\ufedf\ufea8\ufe8e\ufead\ufe9f\ufef4\ufe94-\ufed7\ufec4\ufeae,2017 ). The correcting strategy was used only in the Qatari case. In this case, a lot of embarrassing information was published in a short time and it seems that choosing the correcting strat-egy was an efficient way for Qatar to mitigate the embarrassment.\nOverall, self-complimenting strategies aim to improve the image of the tar-geted states following a public cyber intrusion. A bolstering strategy seeks to shift the discussion to emphasize the positive traits of the targeted state. Reas-serting control seeks to convince the audience that the state is competent, capable, and manages the situation. As Shandler and Gomez (2022) show, cyber intrusions diminish public confidence in the government. Thus, reas-serting control aims to restore such confidence within the domestic public as well asinternational businesses. A correcting strategyseeks to present infor-mation in a way that will shed good light on the targeted state.\nAccusing strategies\nStates can adopt accusing strategies to denigrate the attacking state and cast it in a bad light. By accusing another actor, the state shifts the blame to the\nexternal actor and situates itself as a victim of bad behavior by others (Benoit, 2014, p. 25). We classify the sub-strategies following Finnemore and Hollis who identify three discrete processes (2020, p. 974).\nFirst, once the intrusion becomes public knowledge, states employ the strategy of exposing. They disclose what happened to third parties, acknowl-edging publicly that they have been attacked (\u201cwe have been attacked\u201d). In all of our cases, state officials issued brief statements admitting that there was an intrusion and providing general details about it. The degree of exposure was dependent on the degree of publicity the intrusion received. For instance, immediately after the Saudi 2015 intrusion, the Spokesperson of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Osama Bin Ahmed Nuqli, only stated that the MFA computer was hacked (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015a). About a month later, when Saudi documents were leaked, Nuqli issued a new statement con-necting the leaked documents to the earlier cyber intrusion (Saudi Arabia MFA, 2015b).\nSecond, in addition to exposing the intrusion, states can engage in the strategy of condemning (\u201cthey are bullies\u201d), which is the process of signaling disapproval of what happened, delegitimizing it, and casting the other side in a bad light. Our findings demonstrate that states often use negative and dero-gatory labels to describe the cyber intrusion or its initiators, such as crime/ criminals, terrorism, enemies of the state, illegitimate actions, and shameful acts. This strategy was used by all states as well and was among the first ones to be used.\nThird, states can also ascribe the intrusion to a particular actor, a strategy known as attributing (\u201cthis is who did it\u201d). The vast literature on attribution highlights the technical, political, and social aspects related to attribution. While attribution can help states \u201cname and shame\u201d the initiator and address public demands for answers, there are also some incentives to eschew attribution, such as maintaining secrecy or strategic calculations (Borghard & Lonergan, 2019; Egloff, 2020b, 2020a; Rid & Buchanan, 2015).\nOverall, accusing strategies seek to shift audience perceptions regarding responsibility\u2014rather than focusing on the failure of the targeted state, these strategies seek to attribute responsibility to a malevolent actor. A second possible goal is norm-setting or norm-reinforcing. By denigrating the intrusion (and/or the initiator) the targeted state reproduces what is appropriate behavior in international politics (Egloff, 2020b; Egloff & Smeets, 2021). That said, harsh accusing strategies could potentially increase the risk of escalation (Egloff, 2020b).\nRhetorical strategies in practice\nIn addition to identifying the variety of strategies employed by the Gulf States following a public cyber intrusion, we can move on to offer some\nTable 2. Distribution of strategies per intrusion.\ngeneral insights regarding the practical use of these strategies. We find that the various strategies were used differently across our cases (table 2).\nOn the one hand, we find that exposing the intrusion, condemning it, and normalizing it were commonly used in all of our cases. Similarly, the rhetori-cal strategies of reasserting control following the intrusion and bolstering the image of the targeted state also appeared in all cases. This suggests that the Gulf countries are indeed sensitive to their image following a cyber intrusion and indicates that these strategies might serve as \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of image management rhetoric. It could also suggest that there is a common repertoire of rhetorical strategies commonly used in the region (or internationally) fol-lowing a failure event. On the other hand, we find that hack-and-leak and hack-and-fake intrusions involve additional strategies that do not appear in other intrusions. Specifically, the strategies of debunking (\u201cthis is a lie\u201d) and correcting (\u201clet me tell you what really happened\u201d) are uniquely used when private information is leaked or fake information is disseminated. This finding is also supported in the Saudi case, where the strategy of debunking primarily appeared after the Saudi Cables were released. It seems that this strategy is more useful when the fabricated information is already outed by others, and the victim states use it to minimize the reputa-tional damage in the fastest way possible\u2014by claiming it is a lie. Further, the strategy of minimizing was used in most cases except the Bahraini one. This can be explained by the fact that there was no visible damage in the Bahraini intrusion.\nWhen appeared, the strategy of attribution emerged relatively little in gov-ernment discourse. Interestingly, only in the Qatari and Bahraini cases, there was a clear public attribution directed at the UAE and Iran, respectively. However, in both cases, such attribution came only after an American source had already attributed the intrusion. It is plausible that Bahrain and\nQatar preferred to \u201cpass the buck,\u201d allowing the hegemon to publicly attri-bute the intrusion, minimizing the risk of escalation and retaliation. These findings resonate with recent works that claim that attribution is a political decision as well as a technical one. The rhetorical strategy of attribution did not appear in any of Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrusions. This behavior might be explained by the Saudi\u2019s inclination not to risk escalation or compel the per-petrator to respond if attribution is publicly made. Since Saudi Arabia and Iran are in constant rivalry and share inspiration as regional powers, choos-ing the option of a public attribution strategy might have greater escalation risks compared to the cases of Qatar and Bahrain.\nIn terms of sequencing, we did not find a particular order in the appear-ance of rhetorical strategies. As can be seen in the supplementary file, early responses were relatively short and mainly included the strategies of expos-ing coupled with minimizing and normalizing.\nConclusions\nWhen thinking about the public response of states to public cyber intrusions, existing literature primarily discusses the risks of retaliation or escalation (Healey & Jervis, 2020; Libicki, 2020; Valeriano et al., 2018) as well as attri-bution (Egloff, 2020b; Rid & Buchanan, 2015). However, as this article shows, states engage in multiple \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies to manage their image and legitimize their restraint. Attribution is only one rhetorical option out of many.\nOur systematic discourse analysis of five cyber intrusions in Gulf states advances three findings. First, drawing partly on the conceptual language used by \u201cimage-repair\u201d and crisis-communication theories, the article cat-egorizes three broad \u201cface-saving\u201d strategies adopted by states following a public cyber intrusion: diminishing strategies, self-complimenting strategies, and accusing strategies. Second, the results suggest that different contextual factors shape the specific strategies used. In cyber intrusions that involve leaking or faking information, unique strategies of debunking or correcting were used. Third, regarding attribution, the cases involving Saudi Arabia\u2014a regional power\u2014did not include public attribution. In contrast, Bahrain and Qatar\u2014smaller powers\u2014did attribute the intrusions but did so only after such attribution was made by American media. These suggestive contextual factors might be used in future research on the rhetoric of cyber responses in other areas.\nIt is important to acknowledge that our findings are not exhaustive and do not include all possible strategies. For instance, our focus on public cyber intrusion means that the strategies of silence (not responding at all) or denial (claiming that nothing happened) were not really usable strategies. Further, theoretically, states also have the option of apologizing to their\npublic for not preventing the intrusion. While apologizing might be con-sidered appropriate in some contexts (Aldar et al., 2021; Lind, 2011; N. L\u00f6wenheim, 2009),10it seems unlikely that a public apology by the targeted states would help mitigate any image-related costs. Instead, apologizing would probably be interpreted as an admission of failure and responsibility.\nThe discursive toolkit identified in this article is not necessarily unique to the Gulf countries. Israel, Albania, and the US\u2014different from the Gulf countries and each other in their regime type\u2014also employed similar strat-egies in response to cyber intrusions directed at them. For instance, after a cyber intrusion against Israel\u2019s water facilities in April 2020, Israeli officials employed the rhetorical strategies of minimizing and reasserting control, stating \u201c[t]he attempted attack was dealt with by the Water Authority and National Cyber Directorate. It should be emphasized that there was no harm to the water supply and it operated, and continues to operate, without interruption\u201d (TOI, 2020). Albania\u2019s response to the Iranian cyber-attack against its governmental systems in September 2022 also involved minimizing and reasserting control. In a video message, the Albanian Prime Minister stated that \u201cThe said attack failed its purpose. Damages may be considered minimal compared to the goals of the aggressor. All systems came back fully operational and there was no irreversible wiping of data\u201d (Republic of Albania, 2022). Both countries also used accusing strat-egies and attributed these intrusions to Iran.\nIn response to the data breach of the OPM in June 2015, The White House Press Secretary primarily employed the strategy of exposing and reasserting control, while avoiding attribution early on. It also used a normalizing strat-egy stating that \u201cto say that our computer systems in the federal government are at risk is not news \u2026 all of the computer networks on which we interact on a daily basis\u2014whether that\u2019s at work, or when we\u2019re checking our email, or purchasing an airline ticket\u2014that there is risk associated with that\u201d (The White House, 2015). In contrast, following the SolarWinds intrusion into United States government networks in December 2020 the White House added a new rhetorical strategy detailing the retaliatory measures taken against Russia (The White House, 2021)\u2014a strategy that can be classified under \u201cbolstering\u201d attempts.\nAdditional research is required in order to delve more into the conditions that explain variations in the rhetorical repertoire of states\u2014Under which conditions do states use silence compared to rhetoric in response to cyber intrusions? Under which conditions do states use some strategies and not others? And under which conditions do states engage in short, laconic mess-ages compared to detailed press conferences or engaging videos? Possible factors could be related to the type of attack, the extent of the damage, the attack\u2019s degree of publicity, the suspected initiator, and the strategic culture of the specific state. Moreover, while this research does not\nexamine the effectiveness of these rhetorical strategies, experimental social science can identify the micro-foundations that make some strategies more persuasive than others.\nThe rhetorical strategies presented here should not be seen as necessarily tied to the cyber context. For example, scholars on public relations have already examined the use of image-repair strategies by governments or indi-vidual leaders following health or environmental crises (Benoit & Henson, 2009; Chon & Kim, 2022; Zhang & Benoit, 2009). IR scholars can extend the framework suggested here to study how states deal with image-related damage caused by kinetic attacks. A quick look at how Israel discursively responded to incendiary kites fired from the Gaza Strip (causing forest and farmland fires in Israel) provides some preliminary suggestions.\nFirst, similar to the cyber context, accusation strategies also seem to appear in the Israeli response (labeling an intrusion as \u201cterrorism\u201d or an infringement of international law, identifying an actor, or condemning the act). Second, self-complimenting strategies also seem to appear in both con-texts but in different ways. For instance, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister used a bol-stering strategy emphasizing that 400 out of 600 kites were intercepted (Hay, 2018). However, Israel\u2019s rhetoric also pointed to its past reputation as a way to bolster its image as a deterring actor\u2014\u201cWe will act and exact a heavy price. We\u2019ve done it in the past. Remember that, because we will do it again now\u201d(Ahronheim et al., 2020). This rhetorical move of referencing the past was not found in our cases. Third, diminishing strategies, while extensively appearing in our findings, do not seem to be rhetorically prevalent in the Israeli response. These suggestive ideas imply that there might be important normative and socio-political differences in the ways states are expected to manage their image in the cyber vs. the kinetic spheres.\nIn sum, this article shows that in addition to covert technical and political strategies to deal with cyber intrusion, states engage in performative public strategies to manage their image. Identifying the various strategies directs our attention to the agency of states\u2014how targeted states perceive the context of the intrusion, interpret it, and narrate it. Diminishing the magni-tude of a cyber intrusion, complimenting the successes of the Self, and accus-ing the adversary of bad behavior allows states to mitigate image-related costs in front of a domestic and international audience and perform their role as ontological security providers (Lupovici, 2023). \u201cFace-saving\u201d strat-egies are the bread and butter of international society\u2014justifications, apolo-gies, rejections, or acknowledgments\u2014are some of the ways states resolve tensions, legitimize their behavior, and reinforce or contest norms. In the case of public cyber intrusions, these rhetorical strategies narrate the intru-sion, justify the lack of retaliation, and potentially facilitate the de-securitiza-tion of the event.\nNotes\n1. Hack-and-leak operations are defined as \u201can intrusion into specific digital systems and networks (hack) and an attempt to influence certain audiences through the public release of information obtained through that intrusion (leak).\u201d Hack-and-fake operations are similarly defined but they involve the public fabrication of information. See Shires, 2019.\n2. For the bigger question of whether cyber capabilities are escalatory, see Bor-\tghard & Lonergan, 2019; Healey & Jervis, 2020.\n3. A similar point is made with regard to countries\u2019 failure to deter (especially when these countries see themselves as deterring actors). Their inability to prevent a challenger damages their sense of Self (Fettweis, 2013; Lupovici, 2016b).\n4. In contrast to shame, which is associated with \u201cperceived deficiencies of one\u2019s core self,\u201d embarrassment is associated with \u201cdeficiencies in one\u2019s presented self.\u201d Thus, shame is a more enduring sense of negative self-evaluation, while embarrassment is tied to more transient, situation-specific failures and pratfalls\u201d(Tangney et al., 1996, p. 1258; cf. Subotic & Zarakol, 2013). Humiliation is under-stood as \u201cas an act of extreme disrespect that intends to deprive an actor of its status as an autonomous agent that counts\u201d (Wolf, 2017, p. 494). It is a result of the actions of another (rather than a failure of the Self) (Lupovici, 2016b, p. 66). 5. The targeted states can also leak information to encourage external actors to reveal the intrusion.\n6. In addition to rhetorical strategies, states also develop legal and institutional \tresponses, see Shires, 2021b.\n7. The datasets we use did not contain any cyber incidents involving the UAE that met our inclusion criteria\u2014such as a range of years, a public response that can be examined in more detail, etc.\n8. We specifically examined the dates in which cyber intrusions were revealed as \twell as key terms in Arabic, such as cyber, hacking, and electronic attack. 9. The impact of these strategies is beyond the scope of this paper.\n10. However, states can also refuse to apologize to protect their identity, see \tZarakol, 2010.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Or Greif, Noya Peer, and Jason Silverman for valuable research assistance, and James Shires and Tarek Tutunji for commenting on previous drafts.

States are heavily dependent on the use of cyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, have similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of property.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations fall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This raises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can deal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both regional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \n\tCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. First of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a significant level ofanonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. All of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State actors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute whether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlowexpressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace and that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that cyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is borderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that cyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), National Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow.\n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n7 \ncould take place. Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber operations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible option. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, regulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject to international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the application of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how international law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of international law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \n\tInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different fora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the regulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8A Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to strengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN GGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before failing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \n\tCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is happening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. As an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a traditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support cyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist in applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility generally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State. Attributing cyber acts to States is difficult because of the special features of cyberspace and because many of \n7 See for example Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 13 and Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3.

Therefore, it has been suggested that attribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \n\tHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of States. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states that it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary international law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States to not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that the State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stopthe attack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace or not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed.\n1.3Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal responsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of international organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State responsibility, but not relevantfor the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in order to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle applies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the use of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules about use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of the study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an armed attack.  However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed \n13 See Chapter 3.5 for a discussion about this. \n14 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n15 Compare Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22. \n9 \nif the due diligence principle is applicable. Other consequences of State responsibility will not be discussed. \nCyberspace is a technical area, but the technical aspects of cyber operations will be covered only in order to understand the problems of cyber operations and how due diligence works in relation to this.\n\tDue diligence is sometimes referred to with other names, for example the obligation of vigilance, the obligation of prevention, and the duty of prevention. I have decided to refer to it as simply due diligence, which is the terminology adopted in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.16 \n\tWhile the examination of the applicability of the due diligence principle is the focus of the study, the scope and the content of the principle will also be discussed in order to understand it. \n1.4Method and material \n1.4.1The dogmatic method and public international law \nTo examine the due diligence principle in cyberspace, I have used a dogmatic approach. There are many different definitions of the dogmatic method, but the main feature is that it attempts to analyze what the established law is, and to interpret the content of the legal sources in question.17 At the same time, this is a study of public international law. Public international law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. In international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all States. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able to interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of international law are different from the sources of domestic law. \nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ19 contains the most widely recognized authoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law.20 The article states that \n16 See Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31 for a discussion about the terminology. \n17 See Lehrberg p. 201 and Hjertstedt p. 167. \n18 Shaw p. 49. \n19 United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice (18 April 1946). 20 Shaw p. 50. \n10 \n[t]he Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: \na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting States; \nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; \nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; \nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law. \n\tThe sources of international law are thus: treaties, custom, general principles, judicial decisions and academic writings. The article is written as an instruction to the Court, but it is considered to be the general list of sources of international law. As stated in the article, judicial decisions and academic writings are subsidiary to the other sources. \tTreaties are based on the customary international law principle pacta sunt servanda, i.e. that agreements are binding.21 Some treaties have a general relevance, so called law-making treaties, while others function more like contracts and apply only between two or a few States.22 Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties23 lay down the general rules of interpretation of treaties. Article 31(1) states that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\nThe second source of international law mentioned in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ is international custom. Customary rules should constitute general practice accepted as law. From this it is possible to deduce two elements to customary rules \u2013 general practice and opinio juris.24 General State practice is the actual behavior of States. Opinio juris is the belief of States that such behavior is, in fact, law. \nShaw describes custom by saying that rules deciding what is allowed and what is not inevitably develop in all societies, even in primitive ones.25 These rules emerge \u201calmost \n21 Ibid p. 67. \n22 Ibid. \n23 United Nations, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Treaty Series, Volume 1155 (1969) p. 331. 24 The ICJ in Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1985, p. 13, para. 27 expressed that the substance of customary law must be \u201clooked for primarily in the actual practice and opinio juris of states\u201d. \n25 Shaw p. 51. \n11 \nsubconsciously\u201d and are upheld by \u201cthe members of the group by social pressures and with the aid of various other more tangible implements.\u201d26 He further states that \n[i]t reflects the consensus approach to decision-making with the ability of the majority to create new law binding upon all, while the very participation of States encourages their compliance with customary rules.27\nState practice needs to be established, widespread and consistent.28 It is a two-sided practice; \u201cone State asserts a right, either explicitly or by acting in a way that impliedly constitutes such an assertion, and the State or States affected by the claim then react either by objecting or by refraining from objection\u201d.29 If there is no protest regarding the claim, it is considered supported. However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long as the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of every single State of the world. \n\tOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a certain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so. This has been confirmed, for example, by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases32, where the Court stated that \u201c[n]ot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it\u201d.33 \tIn some cases, it is rather difficult to point to a distinct line between treaty and custom. For example, a treaty provision could establish the foundation of a rule which, together with opinio juris, may lead to the formation of a binding customary rule for all States, not only the ones party to the treaty.34 This was pointed out by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases where it was considered to be one of the established methods of creating new customary rules.35 However, it is not just any provision that can constitute customary law. According to the Court, the specific provision has to be \u201cof fundamentally \n26 Ibid. \n27 Ibid p. 52-53. \n28 International Law Commission, Draft Conclusions on identification of customary international law, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2019)p. 3 conclusion 8. 29 Ibid. \n30 Ibid. \n31 Ibid. \n32North Sea Continental Shelf cases (Federal Republic of Germany v.

One of the challenges when applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the customary rule. \n1.4.2The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed through international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand the principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding cyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually classified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements regarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and opinio juris.\nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. The few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due diligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of environmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to due diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary law. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence rule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement of the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is not an official document or an official source of international law. It does not in any \n36 Ibid para. 72. \n37 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 38 Ibid. \n13 \nway represent States\u2019 view on applicable law in cyberspace. However, it is an effort to assess what the law is (lex lata) and should be credited some weight in the discussion. \tAs was mentioned already in the introduction, the UN created a Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) in 2004. The group has released two consensus reports39 which will also be used in the assessment of the due diligence principle in cyberspace. Although, of course, the reports are not similar to treaties, they do have considerable weight for cyber international law. \nFurthermore, the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts40 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility) will be used in order to provide a background for the reader about the concept of State responsibility in public international law. Since the articles are not a treaty, they are not binding on any States. However, the United Nations Assembly commended the articles to member States in 2012 and they have also been repeatedly referred to by courts, tribunals, and other international bodies. \n\tFinally, academic writings, which have made a big contribution to establishing the content of due diligence in cyberspace, will be used. \n1.5Outline of the thesis \nThe thesis will, in Chapter 2, introduce the concept of cyber operations. Cyberspace will be defined, as will cyber operations. Thereafter, it will be discussed whether public international law is applicable in cyberspace. \nIn Chapter 3, State responsibility is discussed. It will be explained what it is and when States can be held responsible for international acts. Attribution will be explained and discussed shortly, and the focus will be on the problems of attributing cyber operations to a State. Countermeasures will also be covered here. \nChapter 4 examines due diligence. There will be an assessment into the history of this customary rule. Due diligence in environmental law will be examined and the conclusions in this subchapter will be used in order to understand due diligence in cyberspace. It will \n39 A/68/98, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) and A/70/174, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015). \n40 International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10). \n14 \nbe discussed whether due diligence applies to cyberspace and what scope the due diligence principle has. \nChapter 5 covers countermeasures which may be used in certain cases as a response to a cyber operation. The chapter discusses how and when countermeasures can be used in relation to the due diligence principle. \nFinally, Chapter 6 will provide a discussion of the conclusions from the study, reiterate the most important parts from the previous chapters and discuss what future initiatives there are relating to due diligence in cyberspace.\n15 \n16 \n2Cyber operations and international law \n2.1What is cyberspace? \nCyberspace has been defined as \u201ca global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\u201d.41 It is generally held that cyberspace is \u201cnot a physical place\u201d and that one of its characterizing features include anonymity.42 It has been compared to the high seas, international airspace and outer space, because it is sort of a \u201cglobal common\u201d.43 However, at the same time, cyberspace would not exist without certain physical components. The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, integrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on the territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems are built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res communis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that cyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal one.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may exercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be international in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or entities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \n\tThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d. In relation to cyberspace, territory is to be understood as the territory connected to the physical aspect of cyberspace. For example, this could be where the computer is located, or where the individual conducting the act is located. The rules may also refer to the cyber \n41 Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 15. \n42 Von Heinegg p. 9. \n43 Ibid. \n44 Ibid. \n45 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 46 Ibid p. 12. \n47 Ibid. \n48 Ibid. \n17 \ninfrastructure of a State, which consequently is part of the physical layer and within the State\u2019s territory. Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \n\tIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication Technologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is that ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or information\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, wireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the source of a misuse or the target of such.53\n2.2What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \tAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber activity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or employs means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d.55 Cyber operations are further defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. A cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, namely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence principle in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A Glossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security Strategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n18 \nnetwork, or the computer and/or computer network itself\u201d. A mere intrusion into a computer system is not included in the term cyber attack.59 Rather, it is to be considered as cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law.60 \n\tHowever, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of cyber attacks.61 Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other words, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. For the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content of the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as formulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which is unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \tWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will be used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. the State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose territory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is located, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber operation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in question. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these cyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals with ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt software and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical infrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential consequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64\n\tCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is important to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. 61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n19 \n2.3The applicability of international law to cyberspace \nAs has already been noted, cyberspace enjoys certain particular features. Cyberspace is borderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily accessible for many actors, including non-State actors.Because of the special character of cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public international law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not within any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most generally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing else,if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless land. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts of acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal void, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security.\nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur in cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind the cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more States. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international law as usual. \n\tThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law applies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has been acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 further states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty is part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN Charter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \n\tFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in international law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and this is true also for cyber operations.71 \n\tThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed since it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace. At the same time, \n65 See for example Barlow. \n66 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 67 Ibid p. 11. \n68 See the United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1945, 1 UNTS XVI art. 2(1). 69 Shaw p. 352. \n70 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 17. 71 Ibid. \n20 \nhowever, it is clear from the second consensus report, in 2015, that there are many different views among the States on international law and the scope of its application. Furthermore, when concluding the last round of deliberations in 2017, it became clear that the UN GGE would not be able to reach consensus and could therefore not release a third consensus report. The task given by the General Assembly was to continue to study \u201chow international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States\u201d.72 Although there are obvious difficulties in the limitations of international rules in cyberspace, and States do not fully agree on the scope, it cannot be doubted that the UN GGE did reach consensus on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. \tIt must be concluded from the above that international law is indeed applicable to cyberspace. \n72 A/RES/70/237, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (23 December 2015). \n21 \n22 \n3State responsibility \n3.1Introduction \nIn order to understand the due diligence principle and how it works, some understanding of State responsibility is needed. State responsibility is a central principle of public international law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The principle stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one State commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State responsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of an international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and who may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \n\tThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 August 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft Articles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly in a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, which is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77\n3.2The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State responsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, regardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. According to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). 76 Shaw p. 568. There was even talk about turning them into a convention. \n77 Crawford p. 45. \n23 \nbecome relevant because of an omission as cases where the wrongful act arises from a positive obligation.78 \n\tArticle 1 is the general rule of State responsibility, which is commonly supported by practice.79 Article 2 states that the internationally wrongful act of a State must be attributable to the State and must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80 \n\tAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles on State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international obligation is.81 \n\tOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered by an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal literature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective responsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson holds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation includes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of whether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 established that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally wrongful act.88 \n\tAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled as an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached is owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the international community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must specifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the position of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation. \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. This element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not the one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of the State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The rules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself. \tThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility is that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit would in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed\u201d.93\n89Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

The main reason for introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation to cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for establishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations produce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been described as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often discussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of international cyber law.\n\tAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important matter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, identifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution in cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \n\tFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This is not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to it. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the computer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address so that it is not trackable. Not only that,but if the actor uses a network modification technique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in fact is.97\n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. 96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n26 \n\tThe second part of the problem, which is perhaps even more daunting, is that it is necessary to identify the person, or the group, operating the computer. Attribution attempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if the location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the person behind the act can be identified.98 \n\tFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established and the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus between the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find a \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the injury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide.101 \n\tTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber operation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several computers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated by different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber operations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further states that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \tAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States responsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the risk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able to use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign and equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If that happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State breaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as countermeasures. \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. 103 Ibid p. 230. \n27 \n\tArticle 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the wrongfulness of an act is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure.In the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ stated that a countermeasure has to meet certain conditions in order to be justifiable.104 First, the countermeasure must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.105 Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it.106 In the view of the Court, an important consideration is that the effects of a countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.107 Furthermore, the Court stated that another condition for the lawfulness of a countermeasure is that its purpose must be to induce the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.108 \n\tCountermeasures are dealt with in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first paragraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations under the draft articles. Countermeasures are limited to the non-performance for the time being of international obligations of the State taking the measures and shall, as far as possible, be taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligation in question. Obligations not affected by countermeasures are covered in Article 50 which makes it clear that countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied by the UN Charter109, obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals and other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. \n\tCountermeasures in relation to the due diligence principle will be further discussed in Chapter 5. \n104Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, p. 7, para. 83. 105 Ibid. \n106 Ibid. \n107 Ibid para. 84. \n108 Ibid para. 87. \n109 Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. \n28 \n4Due diligence \n4.1Introduction \nThere are two different ways in which States can be held responsible. The first one is by attribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in previous chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence principle. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the due diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, military responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the threshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate. \n\tThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber operations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more common with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of cyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are generally not ableto be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, usually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have international responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent the act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, not the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence have previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility.112 \n\tDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the context and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle in Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, its development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in the field of cyberspace. \n4.2The history of due diligence \nAs has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that their territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State. In the 17th century, \n110 Geiss & Lahmann p. 657. \n111 Crawford & Olleson p. 456. \n112 Hessbrueggep. 268. \n29 \nGrotius established the foundation of the concept of due diligence.113 However, it would take until the 19th century before due diligence began to assume its current form and to impose a duty on States.114 In the early days, because of the increased movement of people across territorial borders, due diligence became important for the protection of aliens.115 For example, Justice Moore observed in the SS Lotus Case that \u201cit is well settled that a State is bound to use due diligence to prevent the commission within its dominions of criminal acts against another nation or its people\u201d.116 \n\tThe concept of State sovereignty also emerged stronger during the 19th centuryand led to a requirement of States to protect \u201cthe security of other States in times of peace and war\u201d.117 The principle of sovereignty is well-established in international law and means that States are prohibited from violating the sovereignty of another State. The principle of sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence is derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty was interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there needs to be a corresponding legal obligation. \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on the circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. The articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other standards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence or want of due diligence. Such standards vary from one context to another for \n113 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, First Report (7 March 2014) p. 2. \n114 Ibid. \n115 Ibid. \n116SS Lotus (France v Turkey), 1927 PCIJ (Ser. A), No 10 para 269. \n117 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 2. \n118Island of Palmas Case (or Miangas), United States v. Netherlands, Award, II RIAA 829, ICGJ 392 (PCA 1928), Permanent Court of Arbitration (4 April 1928) p. 839. \n119 Ibid. \n30 \nreasons which essentially relate to the object and purpose of the treaty provision or other rule giving rise to the primary obligation.120\nWhat this suggests is that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility do not control whether the primary rule in question requires an element of fault or lack of diligence before it can be considered a breach.121 Furthermore, the Commentary held that States are not responsible for the acts of private individuals if they are, for example, seizing an embassy (which the rules of attribution make clear), but \u201cit will be responsible if it fails to take all necessary steps to protect the embassy from seizure, or to regain control over it\u201d.122 From this it is clear that the Commission did indeed consider the obligation of due diligence. \n\tDue diligence saw the biggest development in practice in the field of environmental law during the second half of the 20th century.123 Since due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Commission included the concept in other contexts.124 Perhaps the most prominent one is in the Draft Articles on the Prevention of Transboundary Harm.125 The Commentaries to the Draft Articles expressed that the duty to take \u201cpreventing or minimization activities measures is one of due diligence\u201d.126 \tCase law has repeatedly referred to the notion of due diligence. For example, in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute between the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.128\nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. There was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. Instead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

Canada, 3 UNRIAA 1905 (1938 and 1941). 128 Ibid p. 1965. \n31 \ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States as the basis of its conclusions.129 The Tribunal held that the Dominion of Canada, according to international law, was responsible for the conduct of the Trail Smelter.130 It further decided that the Trail Smelter should be required to refrain from causing any damage through fumes in the State of Washington and to fix the indemnity of such damage. \nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision has, however, received some criticism. It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international principle.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that the obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal only expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One might claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to the specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the development of due diligence in environmental law is examined.\nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case law. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle outside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel casetried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held Albania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their omission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle. Corfu Channel has been said to best articulate the general principle of due diligence.133 \tFurthermore, in its Advisory Opinion to the UN General Assembly on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons134, the ICJ stated that \u201c[t]he existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control \n129 Miller, Trail Smelter Arbitration para 7. \n130Trail Smelter Arbitration, United States v. Canada, 3 UNRIAA 1905 (1938 and 1941) p. 1965. 131 Miller para. 7. \n132Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22.\n133 Chircop p. 649. \n134Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, p. 226 [hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion]. \n32 \nrespect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment\u201d.135 \n\tThe rise of transnational terrorism has further raised the attention of the doctrine of due diligence. The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that the Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective measures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations or camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or their citizens.136 \n\tThere are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although the term itself is at times absent. This is especially true for international treaty law.137 There are exceptions, such as the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women138, whichexplicitly includes due diligence in article 5. Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. Nonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law. It is also particularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of responsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \n\tAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part of customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law (including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 They explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its desirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral standards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact result or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the more general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time. Therefore, it is not surprising that due diligence remains a prominent standard of influential law and that its use has spread, and is still spreading, to other areas of international law besides environmental law. \n135 Ibid p. 242. \n136 UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000). \n137 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 6. \n138Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, CETS No. 210 (11 May 2011). \n139 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, Second Report (July 2016) p. 2. \n140 Ibid p. 5. \n141 Ibid. \n33 \n4.3Due diligence in environmental law \nDue diligence has seen the most development in the field of environmental law. Because of this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when assessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and scope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of international treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. Shaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally as the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due diligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation prescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other relevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the prevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. Due diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d.\nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization measures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that will determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the present articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended to guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to do so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. 143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2001). \n34 \npossible efforts to minimize the risk. In this sense, it does not guarantee that the harm would not occur.147\nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of conduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The State simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills its due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS similarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable means at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not stated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating prevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a stricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. What is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness included in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its obligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, for example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, or use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly expressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. The Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case concerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the United States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States and a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the reference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a private company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, the State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its territory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental statement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter Pulp Mills]. \n35 \nall the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.150 Note that, similarly to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, the Court included \u201cdamage\u201d as a criterium for due diligence to apply.\nA relevant question is whether the principle adopted in the environmental case law can be extended to other areas of international law. It is possible, for example, to argue that the Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle should be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument does not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in environmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to the specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in relation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant transboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to context. There is not one standard of due diligence which applies to all primary rules.152 This was confirmed by the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion.153 The Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion (2011)154concerned the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga who both put forward applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the area reserved for the conduct of activities by the Seabed Mining Authority. The Area means the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.155  The Council of the International Seabed Authority submitted the Advisory Opinion to the Seabed Disputes Chamber and requested that the Chamber rendered an advisory opinion on certain questions of, inter alia, legal responsibilities and obligations of States. The Chamber therefore had the opportunity to add to the case law of due diligence. It stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over \n150 Ibid. \n151 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n152 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 20. \n153 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n154Responsibilities and obligations of States with respect to activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion, 1 February 2011, ITLOS Reports 2011, p. 10 [hereinafter the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion]. \n155 See UNCLOS art. 1 para. 1(1). \n36 \ntime \u201cas measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge\u201d.156 \tFurthermore, the standard of due diligence may depend on the risk of the activities. In Pulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent significant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural obligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to notify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \n\tThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be divided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary harm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an EIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, if there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with the potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk ascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State determines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult the affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the obligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe Judgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State of origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been established.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one circumstance. It is, for example, possible to imagine a scenario in which a State is aware \n156Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion para. 117. \n157Pulp Mills para 204. \n158Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2015, p. 665 [hereinafter Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua]. \n159 Ibid para. 104. \n160 Ibid. \n161 Ibid. \n162 Ibid, Separate Opinion of Judge Donoghue p. 788, para. 21. \n37 \nof a potential risk which warrants notifying potentially affected States, but where there is no need to do an EIA. The State might also need the input of a potentially affected State in order to carry out the EIA. \nThe damage needs to be established \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d, as emphasized by the tribunal in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case.163 This is true for all issues regarding State responsibility, not only the due diligence principle.164 The due diligence obligation also must be foreseeable for States. \n\tThe ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.165 This suggests that it is not enough to fulfil the due diligence obligation to claim that a State did not have actual knowledge. It must also be established whether the State had constructive knowledge.166 \n\tInternational environmental law has significantly helped in the understanding of the notion of due diligence. However, it remains unclear how much the particulars of due diligence in environmental law can be used to establish the content of the principle in other areas of international law. More specifically, the question for the following chapters is how our knowledge of due diligence so far can help in the assessment of the due diligence principle applicable to cyber operations. \n4.4The applicability of due diligence in cyberspace \nAs cyberspace was emerging, a pressing issue was whether international law, and, more specifically, the prohibition on violation of sovereignty applied to cyberspace as well. As has already been discussed, there is now a general consensus that it does apply to cyberspace. Does this mean that due diligence is also applicable in cyberspace? \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \u2013 yes. The manual clearly states that it considers its rules to be reflecting the law as it is (lex lata).167 The International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 explains that new technologies are \u201csubject to pre-existing international law absent a legal exclusion therefrom\u201d and argue that this means that the due diligence principle applies in cyberspace. 168The argument therefore goes that since due diligence is to be considered a general principle of international law, it is presumed \n163Trail Smelter Arbitration p. 1965. \n164 See Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission as referenced in Chapter 3.2. \n165Corfu Channel p. 18. \n166 See a further discussion about constructive knowledge in Chapter 4.5.5. \n167 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 168 Ibid p. 31, with reference to the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion para. 39. \n38 \nthat it is applicable to cyberspace unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it. At this moment, there is no such conclusive State practice or opinio juris. On the contrary, several States have expressed both that customary international law applies to cyberspace and that due diligence is among these customary rules.\n\tFor example, the White house stated, in its International Strategy for Cyberspace (2011), that \u201c[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete. Long-standing international norms guiding state behavior \u2013 in times of peace and conflict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace\u201d.169 \n\tThe French ministry of defense published a document in September 2019, describing its views on how international law applies in cyberspace.170 France, by reference to the 2015 UN GGE consensus report, declared that sovereignty over computer systems on the State\u2019s territory creates a customary obligation of due diligence and that the duty means that the State should not \u201cknowingly allow its territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICT\u201d.171 \n\tIn July 2019, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a letter172 to the parliament, explained the view of the Government on international law\u2019s applicability in cyberspace. The Annex to the letter, referring to Corfu Channel, and noting that not all countries agree that due diligence is an obligation in its own right in international law, clearly states that the Netherlands views the principle as an obligation in its own right.173 Violating the principle therefore constitutes an internationally wrongful act.174 \n\tMost State documents, however, stay quiet on the topic of due diligence obligations and avoid connecting it to the attribution problematics.175 Nonetheless, V\u00e4ljataga says that it is possible to detect notions of States\u2019 views on due diligence in these documents.176 Partly by looking at national cyber security strategies, she draws a speculative conclusion that States \u201cagree that cyber due diligence follows from cyber sovereignty\u201d but that they \u201chave not agreed on whether and how cyber due diligence can form the basis for state \n169 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security and Openness in a Networked World (Washington, 2011) p. 9. \n170 Roguski. \n171 Roguski. \n172 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019). \n173 Ibid Appendix p. 4. \n174 Ibid. \n175 V\u00e4ljataga, Tracing opinio juris in National Cyber Security Strategy Documents p. 8. \n176 Ibid. \n39 \nresponsibility\u201d.177 At the same time, the strategy documents seem to recognize the obligations and responsibilities deriving from sovereignty.178 Since due diligence is an obligation deriving from sovereignty, States still seem open to the fact that it is applicable to cyberspace, although the scope of its applicability is not clear.\nIt was also affirmed by the UN General Assembly, already in 2001, that States should take preventive measures in cyberspace.179 The UN General Assembly encouraged States \nto \u201censure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u201d.180 \n\tFurthermore, the UN GGE\u2019s have expressed that principles of international law that \u201cflow\u201d from the principle of sovereignty are binding in the cyber context.181 Since due diligence is a principle which derives from the principle of sovereignty, this statement should include due diligence. Additionally, the UN GGE included in its 2015 report the recommendation that \u201cStates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u201d.182 \n\tAt the same time, however, those who do not believe due diligence to be applicable in the context of cyber operations have used the UN GGE as an argument against its applicability.183 In their reports, the Experts stated that States \u201cshould\u201d observe the due diligence principle, rather than that they \u201cmust\u201d.184 Nevertheless, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the GGE\u2019s statements do not \u201cdefinitively refute the existence of such a principle\u201d.185 \n\tWhile there is considerable evidence which points to the fact that due diligence should be considered applicable in the cyber context, it is a fact that not all States have accepted due diligence as customary law, especially not in cyberspace.186 States are reluctant to credit the due diligence principle with a lex lata status. Considering that cyberspace still has to be seen as a new area of international law, this is not surprising. It is difficult, however, to draw any conclusions as to what States will say about the due diligence principle. Here it is relevant to point out that State practice must be widespread and \n177 Ibid p. 9. \n178 Ibid p. 18. \n179 A/RES/55/63, Combating the criminal misuse of information technologies (4 December 2000) p. 2. 180 Ibid. \n181 UN GGE 2013 Report para 20. \n182 UN GGE 2015 Report para. 13(c). Compare also para. 28(e). \n183 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 184 UN GGE 2013 Report, para 23; UN GGE 2015 Report paras. 13(c), 28(e). \n185 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 186 Hankinson.\n40 \nconsistent, but that it does not need to be the practiceof every State in order to be a customary rule. Considering the few statements that do exist, or have been made public about due diligence, it is not enough to establish such State practice or opinio juris. \tAlthough it cannot be predicted whether State practice and opinio juris will confirm or deny the applicability of due diligence to cyberspace, the argument of this thesis is that the principle should be treated as applicable to cyberspace. This also follows the prerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of international law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is such a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the area of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context. It is my view that due diligence will be applicable, in one way or another, in cyberspace. The main question to be answered is what the content of the applicable principle will be. \n4.5The scope of due diligence \n4.5.1General notes about the scope \nRule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle in cyberspace: \nA State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.187\n\tThe basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise due diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not used to harm other States\u201d.188 The International Group of Experts have used the commonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct expected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.189 \n\tThe due diligence principle applies to all third party cyber operations. It does not matter if the cyber operation is carried out by a private person, a corporation, a non-State actor, or a State.190\n187 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. 188 Ibid. \n189 Ibid. \n190 Ibid p. 32. \n41 \nOne of the concerns about the due diligence principle is that the principle would put an unreasonable burden on States. In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It will cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the principle. \n4.5.2Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to amount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it would not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation if the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example regarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using cyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to terminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber espionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \n\tThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its territory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the territorial State itself\u201d.194 \n\tHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in the due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts amounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State actors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful acts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. The International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle applies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the cyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target State.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the conduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which made the due diligence obligation come into play. \n42 \nthere are many non-State actors in cyberspace (similar to in environmental law), it would not be reasonable to exclude these from the scope of the principle. What the International Group of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding non-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence principle is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to affect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One example of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. Since non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if the non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes the target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in question. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company publishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence principle will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target State is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a private company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the documents itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious adverse consequences for the target State. \n4.5.3Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about fault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to environmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The harm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could potentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental entities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations when the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. The criteria \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d was included in Rule 6 by analogy from the content of the due diligence principle in international environmental \n197 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 36. 198 Ibid. \n199 See for example Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n43 \nlaw.200 In the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, it was stated that it needed to be \u201cof serious consequence\u201d, and the ICJ in Pulp Mills held that the conduct had to amount to \u201csignificant damage\u201d for another State. The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it is clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The International Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, for example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that the conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \n\tStatesalso seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The Netherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle applies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently serious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends on the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This is also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The International Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of serious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \n\tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold of serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that are placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber operation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not mean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse consequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due diligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker group. The International Group of Experts were split on how to treat this issue. While a few suggested that it would be a violation, it was pointed out by the majority that such a view would put the due diligence obligation in the perspective of the target State, rather than the territorial States. Instead, they claimed that due diligence \u201cderives from the \n200 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 37. 201 Ibid. \n202 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019) p. 5. \n203 Ibid. \n204 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. 205 Definition of botnet according to the Glossary in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 563 is a \u201cnetwork of compromised computers, so-called \u2018bots\u2019, remotely controlled by an intruder, \u2018the botherder\u2019, used to conduct coordinated cyber operations, such as \u2018distributed denial of service\u2019 operations\u201d. \n206 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. \n44 \nsovereign prerogatives of the territorial State\u201d.207 A consequence of following the minority\u2019s line could also be that States might be held responsible for the omissions of other States. Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the harm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm manifests.208\n4.5.4Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for activities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the obligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over a territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during military occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over government cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission network on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard sovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure in diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \n\tThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the due diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a destructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located in State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures to put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212\n\tIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the cyber infrastructure is located in State C.\nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due diligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through which only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable. Although hesitantly, they concluded that it did apply if the transit State had knowledge of the cyber operation, if \n207 Ibid. \n208 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 39. \n209 Ibid p. 32 \n210 Ibid. \n211 Ibid p. 33. \n212 Ibid p. 32. \n213 Ibid p. 33. \n45 \nthe cyber operation reaches the relevant threshold of harm and the transit State is able to take feasible measures to effectively terminate the operation. Bannelier-Christakis adds to this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by the due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going to cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this attack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At the same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for violating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, but also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had knowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same conclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be able to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they do have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an obligation to do so. \n4.5.5Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have knowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case made it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was dependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before the date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold a State responsible for something it was not aware of. The Court further stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its \nterritory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d about the circumstances.220 In other words, States do not have an absolute knowledge of everything that is happening on their territory. However, it may be reasonable to ask of a State to \u201cuse best effort to gain knowledge of activity within its territory or jurisdiction\u201d.221\n214 Bannelier-Christakis p. 6. \n215 Ibid. \n216 Ibid. \n217 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. 218 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n219Corfu Channel p. 22. \n220 Ibid p. 18. \n221 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n46 \nWhether it can be considered reasonable or not, however, does depend on the circumstances of each situation. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that as soon as the territorial State has knowledge of the cyber operation, the State must take all reasonably available measures to stop that cyber operation.222 The International Group of Experts stated that it is \u201ca constitutive element in the application of this Rule\u201d.223 There is nothing controversial about the due diligence applying for actual knowledge. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State having actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber operation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about such a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had such knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of constructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The International Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive knowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in question, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still applies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to certain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include constructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another issue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of factors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being used, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber operation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State to have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very clear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. 223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n47 \nit might be unreasonable to expect the State to have known about it.230 Once again, the principle shows that it is not being unreasonable in what is required of States. \n4.5.6Reasonableness and the flexibility of the due diligence principle \nIn the introduction to this chapter, it was stated that the due diligence principle does not impose an unreasonable burden on States. This has already been made clear from the way it is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that it is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described as providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only prescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law since it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their behavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it could reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in environmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It has further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that the principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \tWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the due diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the circumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also imply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber operation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for example, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of bona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that States only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already from the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of prevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11.\n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68.\n48 \nobligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur\u201d.236 \tAnother way of expressing the reasonableness standard is to understand it as a requirement of conduct which would be the standard by any reasonable State in the prevailing circumstances.237 Although the standard of reasonableness does not have any clear content or criteria, general guidelines from other areas of international law, such as international environmental law, can be used to establish the scope of the principle. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also includes reasonableness throughout their commentary on Rule 6. For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable to expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant circumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been breached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance with the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a right of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239\n\tRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in order to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that developing States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar manner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have breached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted to use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are taken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. Reasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be expected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements of what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not become an unreasonable burden for States.\n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n49 \n4.5.7The measures adopted \nAnother question is what exactly States need to do in order to fulfil their due diligence obligation. Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this question. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken reasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to have violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting its cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some sort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the means to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence obligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another State. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there are no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence varies depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree of due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and have already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to be an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation of States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of their cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due diligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not undisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does imply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to the Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. 245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n50 \nof the United States [\u2026], to take in due time any effective measures of prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable\u201d.246 The ICJ, inthe Corfu Channel case, further held that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 The ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the British warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge of it. In the latter case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, the ICJ stated that Uganda was responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.248 Simply notifying the target State may not always be enough. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are required to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \n\tSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in cyberspace includes. The due diligence principle does not make a difference between a situation in peacetime and during conflict. However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during conflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due diligence continues to apply, nonetheless.\n\tFurthermore, the due diligence obligationis only concerned with ongoing operations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is complete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \n\tEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due diligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require certain specific measures in some circumstances. For example, in Pulp Mills, it was \n246Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Award rendered on 14 September 1872 by the tribunal of arbitration established by Article I of the Treaty of Washington of 8 May 1871, Volume XXIX, pp. 125-134, p. 130.

Uganda), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2005, p. 168, para. 179. [emphasis added]. \n249 See for example Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. \n250 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 11. \n251 For example Rule 153 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 560 about response by parties to the conflict to violations. \n252 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n253 Ibid. \n51 \nestablished that it might be necessary to do an EIA, the use of which was later further developed in Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua. In the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological knowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been described of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted to fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due diligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method of assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is confirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. Indeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact assessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the operations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is required of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle requires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While environmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what the content of the due diligence principle will be. \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may ultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, and regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are required to do. \n4.5.8Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which to hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is especially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 Cyberspace is undeniably included in this.\nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for States. The obligation varies depending on the context and the level of development of the State. Due diligence must be seen in the light of the capabilities of the States \n254 Stockburger p. 248. \n255 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n256 Ibid. \n52 \nconcerned and these capabilities will be taken into account when determining whether a State has breached the due diligence obligation or not. If a burden put on a State is deemed to be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence obligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established customary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the principle in relation to cyber operations.In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great addition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of Experts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be in line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule 6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field of cyberspace. \n4.6Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, some authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, Stockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence obligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence principle to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also argues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially affect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is not customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex ferenda.260 \n\tThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore considered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be used to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \tDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. For example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International Health Regulations261imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257. See also above in Chapter 4.5.7. \n260 Ibid p. 260. \n261 World Health Assembly, International Health Regulations. Geneva, World Health Organization (2005). \n53 \n[their territories]\u201d. This sort of system could be used in the cyber context, which would be more of an obligation to prevent rather than repress. However, at this point in time, there is rather wide skepticism against pure preventive measures. Although the obligation itself would not pose a huge burden on States, the possibility of States agreeing on these types of obligations seems unlikely at the moment, considering for example that it was not too long ago that certain States for the first time acknowledged that international law applies to cyberspace. Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace is rather a question for the future. \n54 \n5Countermeasures \n5.1Countermeasures in cyberspace \nAs explained in Chapter 3.5, countermeasures are a way for injured States to induce a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to comply with its legal obligations. The use of countermeasures in response to a cyber operation has been regulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. \nRule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 lays out the general principle of countermeasures in cyberspace.262 It holds that a State may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal obligation that it is owed by another State. Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a responsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule 22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The regulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are avoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is not completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of the territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. Granted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation emanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. However, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether the territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary to trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing degree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is relatively high.266\n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. 263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n55 \n5.2The scope of countermeasures in cyberspace \nThe Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case conditions still apply and are reflected in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the countermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justifiedin a due diligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in State A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this case, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to control the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control its territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.269 \n\tNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful omission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking countermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. The countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the severity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \n\tThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the international context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take measures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in relation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that fact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due diligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, since that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \n\tAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can be either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \tIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of countermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, in the field of cyberspace.271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. In its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due diligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. 269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n56 \ncountermeasures.272 At the same time, France made it clear that only non-forcible countermeasures are allowed and that the failure of a State to fulfill the due diligence obligation does not justify an exception from the prohibition of the use of force.273 It is yet to be seen what other States believe to the be the law of countermeasures in cyberspace. \n272 Roguski. \n273 Roguski. \n57 \n58 \n6Conclusion \n6.1Some summarizing comments about due diligence in cyberspace The purpose of this study was to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the same way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber operations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the anonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations to States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having to be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have a responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international activities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be used also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered applicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a status as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, doctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, which has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all areas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general principle of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace.That is the thesis of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, or at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not apply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. States may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but neither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due diligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the statements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n59 \nState practice or opinio juris. As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent in order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to be positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more reluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence obligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to cyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \tFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the principle is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber operations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has been stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. Additionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only slightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the malicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, must affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the State. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could not agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due diligence principle, but there are still problems to solve. \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of the principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber operations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of international law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of the due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between different interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the problem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary with a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations.\n6.2As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n60 \nStates, and to submit a report on the results of the study.274 The new UN GGE already had a substantive session on 9-13 December 2019 and released a collated summaries of their regional consultations.275 From the summary, it can be noted that some States suggested that due diligence should be brought up and looked into, particularly \u201cwhere actions within one State\u2019s territory affect the rights of other States\u201d.276 Furthermore, the UN GGE provided that the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offered an academic perspective on the applicability of international law, but that more work was needed in this field.277 The UN GGE is due to submit its final report to the General Assembly in 2021.278 \n\tThe UN General Assembly also decided to convene an open-ended working group with the applicability of international law on its agenda.279 The working group convened for the first time in 2019 and operates on a consensus basis.280 Due diligence in cyberspace is a current issue and the trend is indeed that it is being more and more included in the work of the UN and that States are starting to express their views on the obligation. Hopefully, by these initiatives, States will be able to further clarify their views on the due diligence principle in cyberspace.\n274 A/RES/73/266, Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (22 December 2018) p. 3 para. 3. \n275 United Nations, Regional Consultations series of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (9-13 December 2019). 276 Ibid p. 8.\n277 Ibid p. 7. \n278 A/RES/73/266 p. 3 para. 3. \n279 A/RES/73/27, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (5 December 2018) para. 5. \n280 Ibid. \n61 \n62 \nSources \nBibliography \nArias, G.J., Are the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks?, Revista Tribuna Internacional, Volume 6, Issue 11 (2017). \nBanks, W, State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0., Texas Law Review, Volume 95, Issue 7 (June, 2017) pp. 1487-1514. \nBannelier-Christakis, K, Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?, Baltic Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 14 (2014). \nBarlow, J, A Declaration of Iessed 24 November 2019.

States are heavily dependent on the use of cyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, have similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of property.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations fall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This raises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can deal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both regional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \n\tCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. First of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a significant level ofanonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. All of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State actors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute whether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlowexpressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace and that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that cyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is borderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that cyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), National Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow.\n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n7 \ncould take place. Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber operations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible option. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, regulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject to international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the application of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how international law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of international law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \n\tInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different fora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the regulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8A Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to strengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN GGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before failing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \n\tCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is happening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. As an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a traditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support cyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist in applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility generally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State. Attributing cyber acts to States is difficult because of the special features of cyberspace and because many of \n7 See for example Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 13 and Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. See also Chapter 2.3. for a more in depth discussion. \n8 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations.\n9 A/RES/58/32, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (8 December 2003) p. 2 para. 4. \n10 A/68/98, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) (UN GGE 2013 Report) and A/70/174, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015) (UN GGE 2015 Report). 11 V\u00e4ljataga. \n12 Arias p. 2. \n8 \nthe actors in cyberspace consist of non-State actors. Therefore, it has been suggested that attribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \n\tHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of States. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states that it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary international law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States to not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that the State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stopthe attack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace or not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed.\n1.3Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal responsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of international organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State responsibility, but not relevantfor the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in order to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle applies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the use of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules about use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of the study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an armed attack.  However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed \n13 See Chapter 3.5 for a discussion about this. \n14 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n15 Compare Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22. \n9 \nif the due diligence principle is applicable. Other consequences of State responsibility will not be discussed. \nCyberspace is a technical area, but the technical aspects of cyber operations will be covered only in order to understand the problems of cyber operations and how due diligence works in relation to this.\n\tDue diligence is sometimes referred to with other names, for example the obligation of vigilance, the obligation of prevention, and the duty of prevention. I have decided to refer to it as simply due diligence, which is the terminology adopted in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.16 \n\tWhile the examination of the applicability of the due diligence principle is the focus of the study, the scope and the content of the principle will also be discussed in order to understand it. \n1.4Method and material \n1.4.1The dogmatic method and public international law \nTo examine the due diligence principle in cyberspace, I have used a dogmatic approach. There are many different definitions of the dogmatic method, but the main feature is that it attempts to analyze what the established law is, and to interpret the content of the legal sources in question.17 At the same time, this is a study of public international law. Public international law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. In international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all States. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able to interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of international law are different from the sources of domestic law. \nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ19 contains the most widely recognized authoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law.20 The article states that \n16 See Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31 for a discussion about the terminology. \n17 See Lehrberg p. 201 and Hjertstedt p. 167. \n18 Shaw p. 49. \n19 United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice (18 April 1946). 20 Shaw p. 50. \n10 \n[t]he Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: \na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting States; \nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; \nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; \nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law. \n\tThe sources of international law are thus: treaties, custom, general principles, judicial decisions and academic writings. The article is written as an instruction to the Court, but it is considered to be the general list of sources of international law. As stated in the article, judicial decisions and academic writings are subsidiary to the other sources. \tTreaties are based on the customary international law principle pacta sunt servanda, i.e. that agreements are binding.21 Some treaties have a general relevance, so called law-making treaties, while others function more like contracts and apply only between two or a few States.22 Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties23 lay down the general rules of interpretation of treaties. Article 31(1) states that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\nThe second source of international law mentioned in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ is international custom. Customary rules should constitute general practice accepted as law. From this it is possible to deduce two elements to customary rules \u2013 general practice and opinio juris.24 General State practice is the actual behavior of States. Opinio juris is the belief of States that such behavior is, in fact, law. \nShaw describes custom by saying that rules deciding what is allowed and what is not inevitably develop in all societies, even in primitive ones.25 These rules emerge \u201calmost \n21 Ibid p. 67. \n22 Ibid. \n23 United Nations, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Treaty Series, Volume 1155 (1969) p. 331. 24 The ICJ in Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1985, p. 13, para. 27 expressed that the substance of customary law must be \u201clooked for primarily in the actual practice and opinio juris of states\u201d. \n25 Shaw p. 51. \n11 \nsubconsciously\u201d and are upheld by \u201cthe members of the group by social pressures and with the aid of various other more tangible implements.\u201d26 He further states that \n[i]t reflects the consensus approach to decision-making with the ability of the majority to create new law binding upon all, while the very participation of States encourages their compliance with customary rules.27\nState practice needs to be established, widespread and consistent.28 It is a two-sided practice; \u201cone State asserts a right, either explicitly or by acting in a way that impliedly constitutes such an assertion, and the State or States affected by the claim then react either by objecting or by refraining from objection\u201d.29 If there is no protest regarding the claim, it is considered supported. However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long as the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of every single State of the world. \n\tOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a certain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so. This has been confirmed, for example, by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases32, where the Court stated that \u201c[n]ot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it\u201d.33 \tIn some cases, it is rather difficult to point to a distinct line between treaty and custom. For example, a treaty provision could establish the foundation of a rule which, together with opinio juris, may lead to the formation of a binding customary rule for all States, not only the ones party to the treaty.34 This was pointed out by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases where it was considered to be one of the established methods of creating new customary rules.35 However, it is not just any provision that can constitute customary law. According to the Court, the specific provision has to be \u201cof fundamentally \n26 Ibid. \n27 Ibid p. 52-53. \n28 International Law Commission, Draft Conclusions on identification of customary international law, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2019)p. 3 conclusion 8. 29 Ibid. \n30 Ibid. \n31 Ibid. \n32North Sea Continental Shelf cases (Federal Republic of Germany v.

Compare also article 38 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties. \n35North Sea Continental Shelf para. 71. \n12 \nnorm-creating character\u201d, meaning it must be able to establish the basis of a general rule of law.36 Furthermore, a treaty rule may have been established with the purpose of codifying a customary rule. \nThis international legal method will be applied throughout the study when attempting to clarify the applicability of the customary rule of due diligence. One of the challenges when applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the customary rule. \n1.4.2The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed through international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand the principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding cyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually classified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements regarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and opinio juris.\nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. The few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due diligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of environmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to due diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary law. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence rule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement of the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is not an official document or an official source of international law. It does not in any \n36 Ibid para. 72. \n37 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 38 Ibid. \n13 \nway represent States\u2019 view on applicable law in cyberspace. However, it is an effort to assess what the law is (lex lata) and should be credited some weight in the discussion. \tAs was mentioned already in the introduction, the UN created a Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) in 2004. The group has released two consensus reports39 which will also be used in the assessment of the due diligence principle in cyberspace. Although, of course, the reports are not similar to treaties, they do have considerable weight for cyber international law. \nFurthermore, the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts40 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility) will be used in order to provide a background for the reader about the concept of State responsibility in public international law. Since the articles are not a treaty, they are not binding on any States. However, the United Nations Assembly commended the articles to member States in 2012 and they have also been repeatedly referred to by courts, tribunals, and other international bodies. \n\tFinally, academic writings, which have made a big contribution to establishing the content of due diligence in cyberspace, will be used. \n1.5Outline of the thesis \nThe thesis will, in Chapter 2, introduce the concept of cyber operations. Cyberspace will be defined, as will cyber operations. Thereafter, it will be discussed whether public international law is applicable in cyberspace. \nIn Chapter 3, State responsibility is discussed. It will be explained what it is and when States can be held responsible for international acts. Attribution will be explained and discussed shortly, and the focus will be on the problems of attributing cyber operations to a State. Countermeasures will also be covered here. \nChapter 4 examines due diligence. There will be an assessment into the history of this customary rule. Due diligence in environmental law will be examined and the conclusions in this subchapter will be used in order to understand due diligence in cyberspace. It will \n39 A/68/98, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) and A/70/174, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015). \n40 International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10). \n14 \nbe discussed whether due diligence applies to cyberspace and what scope the due diligence principle has. \nChapter 5 covers countermeasures which may be used in certain cases as a response to a cyber operation. The chapter discusses how and when countermeasures can be used in relation to the due diligence principle. \nFinally, Chapter 6 will provide a discussion of the conclusions from the study, reiterate the most important parts from the previous chapters and discuss what future initiatives there are relating to due diligence in cyberspace.\n15 \n16 \n2Cyber operations and international law \n2.1What is cyberspace? \nCyberspace has been defined as \u201ca global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\u201d.41 It is generally held that cyberspace is \u201cnot a physical place\u201d and that one of its characterizing features include anonymity.42 It has been compared to the high seas, international airspace and outer space, because it is sort of a \u201cglobal common\u201d.43 However, at the same time, cyberspace would not exist without certain physical components. The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, integrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on the territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems are built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res communis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that cyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal one.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may exercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be international in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or entities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \n\tThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d. In relation to cyberspace, territory is to be understood as the territory connected to the physical aspect of cyberspace. For example, this could be where the computer is located, or where the individual conducting the act is located. The rules may also refer to the cyber \n41 Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 15. \n42 Von Heinegg p. 9. \n43 Ibid. \n44 Ibid. \n45 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 46 Ibid p. 12. \n47 Ibid. \n48 Ibid. \n17 \ninfrastructure of a State, which consequently is part of the physical layer and within the State\u2019s territory. Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \n\tIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication Technologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is that ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or information\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, wireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the source of a misuse or the target of such.53\n2.2What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \tAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber activity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or employs means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d.55 Cyber operations are further defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. A cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, namely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence principle in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A Glossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security Strategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n18 \nnetwork, or the computer and/or computer network itself\u201d. A mere intrusion into a computer system is not included in the term cyber attack.59 Rather, it is to be considered as cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law.60 \n\tHowever, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of cyber attacks.61 Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other words, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. For the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content of the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as formulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which is unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \tWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will be used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. the State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose territory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is located, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber operation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in question. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these cyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals with ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt software and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical infrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential consequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64\n\tCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is important to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. 61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n19 \n2.3The applicability of international law to cyberspace \nAs has already been noted, cyberspace enjoys certain particular features. Cyberspace is borderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily accessible for many actors, including non-State actors.Because of the special character of cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public international law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not within any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most generally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing else,if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless land. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts of acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal void, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security.\nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur in cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind the cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more States. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international law as usual. \n\tThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law applies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has been acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 further states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty is part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN Charter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \n\tFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in international law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and this is true also for cyber operations.71 \n\tThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed since it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace. At the same time, \n65 See for example Barlow. \n66 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 67 Ibid p. 11. \n68 See the United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1945, 1 UNTS XVI art. 2(1). 69 Shaw p. 352. \n70 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 17. 71 Ibid. \n20 \nhowever, it is clear from the second consensus report, in 2015, that there are many different views among the States on international law and the scope of its application. Furthermore, when concluding the last round of deliberations in 2017, it became clear that the UN GGE would not be able to reach consensus and could therefore not release a third consensus report. The task given by the General Assembly was to continue to study \u201chow international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States\u201d.72 Although there are obvious difficulties in the limitations of international rules in cyberspace, and States do not fully agree on the scope, it cannot be doubted that the UN GGE did reach consensus on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. \tIt must be concluded from the above that international law is indeed applicable to cyberspace. \n72 A/RES/70/237, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (23 December 2015). \n21 \n22 \n3State responsibility \n3.1Introduction \nIn order to understand the due diligence principle and how it works, some understanding of State responsibility is needed. State responsibility is a central principle of public international law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The principle stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one State commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State responsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of an international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and who may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \n\tThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 August 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft Articles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly in a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, which is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77\n3.2The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State responsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, regardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. According to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). 76 Shaw p. 568. There was even talk about turning them into a convention. \n77 Crawford p. 45. \n23 \nbecome relevant because of an omission as cases where the wrongful act arises from a positive obligation.78 \n\tArticle 1 is the general rule of State responsibility, which is commonly supported by practice.79 Article 2 states that the internationally wrongful act of a State must be attributable to the State and must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80 \n\tAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles on State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international obligation is.81 \n\tOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered by an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal literature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective responsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson holds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation includes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of whether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 established that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally wrongful act.88 \n\tAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled as an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached is owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the international community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must specifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the position of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation. \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. This element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not the one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of the State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The rules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself. \tThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility is that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit would in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed\u201d.93\n89Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

United States of America), Merits, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, p. 14 para. 115 [emphasis added] [hereinafter the Nicaragua case]. \n25 \nFinally, Article 9 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered as an act of the State under international law if the person or group was in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities and in circumstances such as to call for the exercise of those elements of authority. \nThis is not a complete examinationof the rules of attribution, but it presents the foundation of attribution and explains the main ways of attributing acts. The main reason for introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation to cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for establishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations produce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been described as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often discussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of international cyber law.\n\tAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important matter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, identifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution in cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \n\tFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This is not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to it. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the computer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address so that it is not trackable. Not only that,but if the actor uses a network modification technique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in fact is.97\n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. 96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n26 \n\tThe second part of the problem, which is perhaps even more daunting, is that it is necessary to identify the person, or the group, operating the computer. Attribution attempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if the location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the person behind the act can be identified.98 \n\tFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established and the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus between the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find a \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the injury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide.101 \n\tTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber operation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several computers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated by different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber operations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further states that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \tAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States responsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the risk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able to use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign and equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If that happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State breaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as countermeasures. \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. 103 Ibid p. 230. \n27 \n\tArticle 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the wrongfulness of an act is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure.In the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ stated that a countermeasure has to meet certain conditions in order to be justifiable.104 First, the countermeasure must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.105 Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it.106 In the view of the Court, an important consideration is that the effects of a countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.107 Furthermore, the Court stated that another condition for the lawfulness of a countermeasure is that its purpose must be to induce the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.108 \n\tCountermeasures are dealt with in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first paragraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations under the draft articles. Countermeasures are limited to the non-performance for the time being of international obligations of the State taking the measures and shall, as far as possible, be taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligation in question. Obligations not affected by countermeasures are covered in Article 50 which makes it clear that countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied by the UN Charter109, obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals and other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. \n\tCountermeasures in relation to the due diligence principle will be further discussed in Chapter 5. \n104Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, p. 7, para. 83. 105 Ibid. \n106 Ibid. \n107 Ibid para. 84. \n108 Ibid para. 87. \n109 Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. \n28 \n4Due diligence \n4.1Introduction \nThere are two different ways in which States can be held responsible. The first one is by attribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in previous chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence principle. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the due diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, military responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the threshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate. \n\tThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber operations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more common with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of cyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are generally not ableto be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, usually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have international responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent the act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, not the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence have previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility.112 \n\tDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the context and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle in Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, its development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in the field of cyberspace. \n4.2The history of due diligence \nAs has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that their territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State. In the 17th century, \n110 Geiss & Lahmann p. 657. \n111 Crawford & Olleson p. 456. \n112 Hessbrueggep. 268. \n29 \nGrotius established the foundation of the concept of due diligence.113 However, it would take until the 19th century before due diligence began to assume its current form and to impose a duty on States.114 In the early days, because of the increased movement of people across territorial borders, due diligence became important for the protection of aliens.115 For example, Justice Moore observed in the SS Lotus Case that \u201cit is well settled that a State is bound to use due diligence to prevent the commission within its dominions of criminal acts against another nation or its people\u201d.116 \n\tThe concept of State sovereignty also emerged stronger during the 19th centuryand led to a requirement of States to protect \u201cthe security of other States in times of peace and war\u201d.117 The principle of sovereignty is well-established in international law and means that States are prohibited from violating the sovereignty of another State. The principle of sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence is derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty was interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there needs to be a corresponding legal obligation. \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on the circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. The articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other standards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence or want of due diligence. Such standards vary from one context to another for \n113 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, First Report (7 March 2014) p. 2. \n114 Ibid. \n115 Ibid. \n116SS Lotus (France v Turkey), 1927 PCIJ (Ser.

For example, in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute between the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.128\nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. There was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. Instead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international principle.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that the obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal only expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One might claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to the specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the development of due diligence in environmental law is examined.\nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case law. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle outside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel casetried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held Albania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their omission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle. Corfu Channel has been said to best articulate the general principle of due diligence.133 \tFurthermore, in its Advisory Opinion to the UN General Assembly on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons134, the ICJ stated that \u201c[t]he existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control \n129 Miller, Trail Smelter Arbitration para 7. \n130Trail Smelter Arbitration, United States v. Canada, 3 UNRIAA 1905 (1938 and 1941) p. 1965. 131 Miller para. 7. \n132Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22.\n133 Chircop p. 649. \n134Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, p. 226 [hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion]. \n32 \nrespect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment\u201d.135 \n\tThe rise of transnational terrorism has further raised the attention of the doctrine of due diligence. The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that the Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective measures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations or camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or their citizens.136 \n\tThere are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although the term itself is at times absent. This is especially true for international treaty law.137 There are exceptions, such as the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women138, whichexplicitly includes due diligence in article 5. Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. Nonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law. It is also particularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of responsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \n\tAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part of customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law (including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 They explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its desirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral standards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact result or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the more general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time. Therefore, it is not surprising that due diligence remains a prominent standard of influential law and that its use has spread, and is still spreading, to other areas of international law besides environmental law. \n135 Ibid p. 242. \n136 UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000). \n137 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 6. \n138Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, CETS No. 210 (11 May 2011). \n139 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, Second Report (July 2016) p. 2. \n140 Ibid p. 5. \n141 Ibid. \n33 \n4.3Due diligence in environmental law \nDue diligence has seen the most development in the field of environmental law. Because of this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when assessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and scope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of international treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. Shaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally as the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due diligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation prescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other relevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the prevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. Due diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d.\nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization measures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that will determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the present articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended to guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to do so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. 143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2001). \n34 \npossible efforts to minimize the risk. In this sense, it does not guarantee that the harm would not occur.147\nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of conduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The State simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills its due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS similarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable means at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not stated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating prevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a stricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. What is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness included in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its obligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, for example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, or use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly expressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. The Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case concerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the United States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States and a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the reference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a private company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, the State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its territory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental statement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter Pulp Mills]. \n35 \nall the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.150 Note that, similarly to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, the Court included \u201cdamage\u201d as a criterium for due diligence to apply.\nA relevant question is whether the principle adopted in the environmental case law can be extended to other areas of international law. It is possible, for example, to argue that the Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle should be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument does not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in environmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to the specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in relation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant transboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to context. There is not one standard of due diligence which applies to all primary rules.152 This was confirmed by the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion.153 The Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion (2011)154concerned the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga who both put forward applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the area reserved for the conduct of activities by the Seabed Mining Authority. The Area means the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.155  The Council of the International Seabed Authority submitted the Advisory Opinion to the Seabed Disputes Chamber and requested that the Chamber rendered an advisory opinion on certain questions of, inter alia, legal responsibilities and obligations of States. The Chamber therefore had the opportunity to add to the case law of due diligence. It stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over \n150 Ibid. \n151 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n152 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 20. \n153 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n154Responsibilities and obligations of States with respect to activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion, 1 February 2011, ITLOS Reports 2011, p. 10 [hereinafter the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion]. \n155 See UNCLOS art. 1 para. 1(1). \n36 \ntime \u201cas measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge\u201d.156 \tFurthermore, the standard of due diligence may depend on the risk of the activities. In Pulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent significant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural obligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to notify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \n\tThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be divided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary harm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an EIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, if there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with the potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk ascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State determines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult the affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the obligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe Judgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State of origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been established.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one circumstance. It is, for example, possible to imagine a scenario in which a State is aware \n156Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion para. 117. \n157Pulp Mills para 204. \n158Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2015, p. 665 [hereinafter Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua]. \n159 Ibid para. 104. \n160 Ibid. \n161 Ibid. \n162 Ibid, Separate Opinion of Judge Donoghue p. 788, para. 21. \n37 \nof a potential risk which warrants notifying potentially affected States, but where there is no need to do an EIA. The State might also need the input of a potentially affected State in order to carry out the EIA. \nThe damage needs to be established \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d, as emphasized by the tribunal in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case.163 This is true for all issues regarding State responsibility, not only the due diligence principle.164 The due diligence obligation also must be foreseeable for States. \n\tThe ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.165 This suggests that it is not enough to fulfil the due diligence obligation to claim that a State did not have actual knowledge. It must also be established whether the State had constructive knowledge.166 \n\tInternational environmental law has significantly helped in the understanding of the notion of due diligence. However, it remains unclear how much the particulars of due diligence in environmental law can be used to establish the content of the principle in other areas of international law. More specifically, the question for the following chapters is how our knowledge of due diligence so far can help in the assessment of the due diligence principle applicable to cyber operations. \n4.4The applicability of due diligence in cyberspace \nAs cyberspace was emerging, a pressing issue was whether international law, and, more specifically, the prohibition on violation of sovereignty applied to cyberspace as well. As has already been discussed, there is now a general consensus that it does apply to cyberspace. Does this mean that due diligence is also applicable in cyberspace? \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \u2013 yes. The manual clearly states that it considers its rules to be reflecting the law as it is (lex lata).167 The International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 explains that new technologies are \u201csubject to pre-existing international law absent a legal exclusion therefrom\u201d and argue that this means that the due diligence principle applies in cyberspace. 168The argument therefore goes that since due diligence is to be considered a general principle of international law, it is presumed \n163Trail Smelter Arbitration p. 1965. \n164 See Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission as referenced in Chapter 3.2. \n165Corfu Channel p. 18. \n166 See a further discussion about constructive knowledge in Chapter 4.5.5. \n167 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 168 Ibid p. 31, with reference to the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion para. 39. \n38 \nthat it is applicable to cyberspace unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it. At this moment, there is no such conclusive State practice or opinio juris. On the contrary, several States have expressed both that customary international law applies to cyberspace and that due diligence is among these customary rules.\n\tFor example, the White house stated, in its International Strategy for Cyberspace (2011), that \u201c[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete. Long-standing international norms guiding state behavior \u2013 in times of peace and conflict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace\u201d.169 \n\tThe French ministry of defense published a document in September 2019, describing its views on how international law applies in cyberspace.170 France, by reference to the 2015 UN GGE consensus report, declared that sovereignty over computer systems on the State\u2019s territory creates a customary obligation of due diligence and that the duty means that the State should not \u201cknowingly allow its territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICT\u201d.171 \n\tIn July 2019, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a letter172 to the parliament, explained the view of the Government on international law\u2019s applicability in cyberspace. The Annex to the letter, referring to Corfu Channel, and noting that not all countries agree that due diligence is an obligation in its own right in international law, clearly states that the Netherlands views the principle as an obligation in its own right.173 Violating the principle therefore constitutes an internationally wrongful act.174 \n\tMost State documents, however, stay quiet on the topic of due diligence obligations and avoid connecting it to the attribution problematics.175 Nonetheless, V\u00e4ljataga says that it is possible to detect notions of States\u2019 views on due diligence in these documents.176 Partly by looking at national cyber security strategies, she draws a speculative conclusion that States \u201cagree that cyber due diligence follows from cyber sovereignty\u201d but that they \u201chave not agreed on whether and how cyber due diligence can form the basis for state \n169 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security and Openness in a Networked World (Washington, 2011) p. 9. \n170 Roguski. \n171 Roguski. \n172 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019). \n173 Ibid Appendix p. 4. \n174 Ibid. \n175 V\u00e4ljataga, Tracing opinio juris in National Cyber Security Strategy Documents p. 8. \n176 Ibid. \n39 \nresponsibility\u201d.177 At the same time, the strategy documents seem to recognize the obligations and responsibilities deriving from sovereignty.178 Since due diligence is an obligation deriving from sovereignty, States still seem open to the fact that it is applicable to cyberspace, although the scope of its applicability is not clear.\nIt was also affirmed by the UN General Assembly, already in 2001, that States should take preventive measures in cyberspace.179 The UN General Assembly encouraged States \nto \u201censure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u201d.180 \n\tFurthermore, the UN GGE\u2019s have expressed that principles of international law that \u201cflow\u201d from the principle of sovereignty are binding in the cyber context.181 Since due diligence is a principle which derives from the principle of sovereignty, this statement should include due diligence. Additionally, the UN GGE included in its 2015 report the recommendation that \u201cStates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u201d.182 \n\tAt the same time, however, those who do not believe due diligence to be applicable in the context of cyber operations have used the UN GGE as an argument against its applicability.183 In their reports, the Experts stated that States \u201cshould\u201d observe the due diligence principle, rather than that they \u201cmust\u201d.184 Nevertheless, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the GGE\u2019s statements do not \u201cdefinitively refute the existence of such a principle\u201d.185 \n\tWhile there is considerable evidence which points to the fact that due diligence should be considered applicable in the cyber context, it is a fact that not all States have accepted due diligence as customary law, especially not in cyberspace.186 States are reluctant to credit the due diligence principle with a lex lata status. Considering that cyberspace still has to be seen as a new area of international law, this is not surprising. It is difficult, however, to draw any conclusions as to what States will say about the due diligence principle. Here it is relevant to point out that State practice must be widespread and \n177 Ibid p. 9. \n178 Ibid p. 18. \n179 A/RES/55/63, Combating the criminal misuse of information technologies (4 December 2000) p. 2. 180 Ibid. \n181 UN GGE 2013 Report para 20. \n182 UN GGE 2015 Report para. 13(c). Compare also para. 28(e). \n183 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 184 UN GGE 2013 Report, para 23; UN GGE 2015 Report paras. 13(c), 28(e). \n185 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 186 Hankinson.\n40 \nconsistent, but that it does not need to be the practiceof every State in order to be a customary rule. Considering the few statements that do exist, or have been made public about due diligence, it is not enough to establish such State practice or opinio juris. \tAlthough it cannot be predicted whether State practice and opinio juris will confirm or deny the applicability of due diligence to cyberspace, the argument of this thesis is that the principle should be treated as applicable to cyberspace. This also follows the prerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of international law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is such a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the area of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context. It is my view that due diligence will be applicable, in one way or another, in cyberspace. The main question to be answered is what the content of the applicable principle will be. \n4.5The scope of due diligence \n4.5.1General notes about the scope \nRule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle in cyberspace: \nA State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.187\n\tThe basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise due diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not used to harm other States\u201d.188 The International Group of Experts have used the commonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct expected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.189 \n\tThe due diligence principle applies to all third party cyber operations. It does not matter if the cyber operation is carried out by a private person, a corporation, a non-State actor, or a State.190\n187 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. 188 Ibid. \n189 Ibid. \n190 Ibid p. 32. \n41 \nOne of the concerns about the due diligence principle is that the principle would put an unreasonable burden on States. In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It will cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the principle. \n4.5.2Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to amount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it would not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation if the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example regarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using cyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to terminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber espionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \n\tThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its territory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the territorial State itself\u201d.194 \n\tHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in the due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts amounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State actors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful acts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. The International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle applies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the cyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target State.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the conduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which made the due diligence obligation come into play. \n42 \nthere are many non-State actors in cyberspace (similar to in environmental law), it would not be reasonable to exclude these from the scope of the principle. What the International Group of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding non-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence principle is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to affect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One example of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. Since non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if the non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes the target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in question. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company publishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence principle will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target State is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a private company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the documents itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious adverse consequences for the target State. \n4.5.3Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about fault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to environmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The harm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could potentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental entities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations when the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. The criteria \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d was included in Rule 6 by analogy from the content of the due diligence principle in international environmental \n197 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 36. 198 Ibid. \n199 See for example Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n43 \nlaw.200 In the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, it was stated that it needed to be \u201cof serious consequence\u201d, and the ICJ in Pulp Mills held that the conduct had to amount to \u201csignificant damage\u201d for another State. The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it is clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The International Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, for example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that the conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \n\tStatesalso seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The Netherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle applies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently serious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends on the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This is also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The International Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of serious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \n\tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold of serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that are placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber operation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not mean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse consequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due diligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker group. The International Group of Experts were split on how to treat this issue. While a few suggested that it would be a violation, it was pointed out by the majority that such a view would put the due diligence obligation in the perspective of the target State, rather than the territorial States. Instead, they claimed that due diligence \u201cderives from the \n200 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 37. 201 Ibid. \n202 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019) p. 5. \n203 Ibid. \n204 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. 205 Definition of botnet according to the Glossary in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 563 is a \u201cnetwork of compromised computers, so-called \u2018bots\u2019, remotely controlled by an intruder, \u2018the botherder\u2019, used to conduct coordinated cyber operations, such as \u2018distributed denial of service\u2019 operations\u201d. \n206 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. \n44 \nsovereign prerogatives of the territorial State\u201d.207 A consequence of following the minority\u2019s line could also be that States might be held responsible for the omissions of other States. Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the harm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm manifests.208\n4.5.4Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for activities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the obligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over a territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during military occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over government cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission network on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard sovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure in diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \n\tThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the due diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a destructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located in State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures to put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212\n\tIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the cyber infrastructure is located in State C.\nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due diligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through which only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable. Although hesitantly, they concluded that it did apply if the transit State had knowledge of the cyber operation, if \n207 Ibid. \n208 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 39. \n209 Ibid p. 32 \n210 Ibid. \n211 Ibid p. 33. \n212 Ibid p. 32. \n213 Ibid p. 33. \n45 \nthe cyber operation reaches the relevant threshold of harm and the transit State is able to take feasible measures to effectively terminate the operation. Bannelier-Christakis adds to this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by the due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going to cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this attack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At the same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for violating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, but also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had knowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same conclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be able to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they do have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an obligation to do so. \n4.5.5Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have knowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case made it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was dependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before the date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold a State responsible for something it was not aware of. The Court further stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its \nterritory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d about the circumstances.220 In other words, States do not have an absolute knowledge of everything that is happening on their territory. However, it may be reasonable to ask of a State to \u201cuse best effort to gain knowledge of activity within its territory or jurisdiction\u201d.221\n214 Bannelier-Christakis p. 6. \n215 Ibid. \n216 Ibid. \n217 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. 218 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n219Corfu Channel p. 22. \n220 Ibid p. 18. \n221 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n46 \nWhether it can be considered reasonable or not, however, does depend on the circumstances of each situation. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that as soon as the territorial State has knowledge of the cyber operation, the State must take all reasonably available measures to stop that cyber operation.222 The International Group of Experts stated that it is \u201ca constitutive element in the application of this Rule\u201d.223 There is nothing controversial about the due diligence applying for actual knowledge. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State having actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber operation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about such a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had such knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of constructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The International Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive knowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in question, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still applies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to certain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include constructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another issue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of factors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being used, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber operation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State to have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very clear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. 223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n47 \nit might be unreasonable to expect the State to have known about it.230 Once again, the principle shows that it is not being unreasonable in what is required of States. \n4.5.6Reasonableness and the flexibility of the due diligence principle \nIn the introduction to this chapter, it was stated that the due diligence principle does not impose an unreasonable burden on States. This has already been made clear from the way it is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that it is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described as providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only prescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law since it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their behavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it could reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in environmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It has further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that the principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \tWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the due diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the circumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also imply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber operation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for example, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of bona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that States only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already from the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of prevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11.\n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68.\n48 \nobligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur\u201d.236 \tAnother way of expressing the reasonableness standard is to understand it as a requirement of conduct which would be the standard by any reasonable State in the prevailing circumstances.237 Although the standard of reasonableness does not have any clear content or criteria, general guidelines from other areas of international law, such as international environmental law, can be used to establish the scope of the principle. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also includes reasonableness throughout their commentary on Rule 6. For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable to expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant circumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been breached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance with the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a right of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239\n\tRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in order to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that developing States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar manner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have breached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted to use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are taken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. Reasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be expected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements of what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not become an unreasonable burden for States.\n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n49 \n4.5.7The measures adopted \nAnother question is what exactly States need to do in order to fulfil their due diligence obligation. Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this question. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken reasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to have violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting its cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some sort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the means to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence obligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another State. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there are no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence varies depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree of due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and have already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to be an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation of States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of their cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due diligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not undisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does imply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to the Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. 245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n50 \nof the United States [\u2026], to take in due time any effective measures of prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable\u201d.246 The ICJ, inthe Corfu Channel case, further held that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 The ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the British warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge of it. In the latter case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, the ICJ stated that Uganda was responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.248 Simply notifying the target State may not always be enough. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are required to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \n\tSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in cyberspace includes. The due diligence principle does not make a difference between a situation in peacetime and during conflict. However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during conflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due diligence continues to apply, nonetheless.\n\tFurthermore, the due diligence obligationis only concerned with ongoing operations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is complete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \n\tEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due diligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require certain specific measures in some circumstances. For example, in Pulp Mills, it was \n246Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Award rendered on 14 September 1872 by the tribunal of arbitration established by Article I of the Treaty of Washington of 8 May 1871, Volume XXIX, pp. 125-134, p. 130. [emphasis added]. \n247Corfu Channel p. 23. [emphasis added]. \n248Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2005, p. 168, para. 179. [emphasis added]. \n249 See for example Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. \n250 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 11. \n251 For example Rule 153 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 560 about response by parties to the conflict to violations. \n252 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n253 Ibid. \n51 \nestablished that it might be necessary to do an EIA, the use of which was later further developed in Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua. In the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological knowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been described of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted to fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due diligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method of assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is confirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. Indeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact assessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the operations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is required of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle requires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While environmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what the content of the due diligence principle will be. \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may ultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, and regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are required to do. \n4.5.8Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which to hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is especially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 Cyberspace is undeniably included in this.\nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for States. The obligation varies depending on the context and the level of development of the State. Due diligence must be seen in the light of the capabilities of the States \n254 Stockburger p. 248. \n255 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n256 Ibid. \n52 \nconcerned and these capabilities will be taken into account when determining whether a State has breached the due diligence obligation or not. If a burden put on a State is deemed to be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence obligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established customary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the principle in relation to cyber operations.In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great addition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of Experts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be in line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule 6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field of cyberspace. \n4.6Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, some authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, Stockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence obligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence principle to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also argues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially affect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is not customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex ferenda.260 \n\tThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore considered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be used to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \tDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. For example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International Health Regulations261imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257. See also above in Chapter 4.5.7. \n260 Ibid p. 260. \n261 World Health Assembly, International Health Regulations. Geneva, World Health Organization (2005). \n53 \n[their territories]\u201d. This sort of system could be used in the cyber context, which would be more of an obligation to prevent rather than repress. However, at this point in time, there is rather wide skepticism against pure preventive measures. Although the obligation itself would not pose a huge burden on States, the possibility of States agreeing on these types of obligations seems unlikely at the moment, considering for example that it was not too long ago that certain States for the first time acknowledged that international law applies to cyberspace. Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace is rather a question for the future. \n54 \n5Countermeasures \n5.1Countermeasures in cyberspace \nAs explained in Chapter 3.5, countermeasures are a way for injured States to induce a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to comply with its legal obligations. The use of countermeasures in response to a cyber operation has been regulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. \nRule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 lays out the general principle of countermeasures in cyberspace.262 It holds that a State may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal obligation that it is owed by another State. Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a responsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule 22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The regulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are avoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is not completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of the territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. Granted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation emanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. However, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether the territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary to trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing degree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is relatively high.266\n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. 263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n55 \n5.2The scope of countermeasures in cyberspace \nThe Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case conditions still apply and are reflected in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the countermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justifiedin a due diligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in State A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this case, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to control the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control its territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.269 \n\tNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful omission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking countermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. The countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the severity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \n\tThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the international context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take measures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in relation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that fact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due diligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, since that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \n\tAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can be either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \tIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of countermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, in the field of cyberspace.271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. In its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due diligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. 269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n56 \ncountermeasures.272 At the same time, France made it clear that only non-forcible countermeasures are allowed and that the failure of a State to fulfill the due diligence obligation does not justify an exception from the prohibition of the use of force.273 It is yet to be seen what other States believe to the be the law of countermeasures in cyberspace. \n272 Roguski. \n273 Roguski. \n57 \n58 \n6Conclusion \n6.1Some summarizing comments about due diligence in cyberspace The purpose of this study was to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the same way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber operations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the anonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations to States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having to be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have a responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international activities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be used also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered applicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a status as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, doctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, which has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all areas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general principle of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace.That is the thesis of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, or at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not apply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. States may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but neither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due diligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the statements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n59 \nState practice or opinio juris. As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent in order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to be positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more reluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence obligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to cyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \tFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the principle is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber operations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has been stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. Additionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only slightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the malicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, must affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the State. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could not agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due diligence principle, but there are still problems to solve. \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of the principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber operations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of international law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of the due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between different interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the problem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary with a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations.\n6.2As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n60 \nStates, and to submit a report on the results of the study.274 The new UN GGE already had a substantive session on 9-13 December 2019 and released a collated summaries of their regional consultations.275 From the summary, it can be noted that some States suggested that due diligence should be brought up and looked into, particularly \u201cwhere actions within one State\u2019s territory affect the rights of other States\u201d.276 Furthermore, the UN GGE provided that the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offered an academic perspective on the applicability of international law, but that more work was needed in this field.277 The UN GGE is due to submit its final report to the General Assembly in 2021.278 \n\tThe UN General Assembly also decided to convene an open-ended working group with the applicability of international law on its agenda.279 The working group convened for the first time in 2019 and operates on a consensus basis.280 Due diligence in cyberspace is a current issue and the trend is indeed that it is being more and more included in the work of the UN and that States are starting to express their views on the obligation. Hopefully, by these initiatives, States will be able to further clarify their views on the due diligence principle in cyberspace.\n274 A/RES/73/266, Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (22 December 2018) p. 3 para. 3. \n275 United Nations, Regional Consultations series of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (9-13 December 2019). 276 Ibid p. 8.\n277 Ibid p. 7. \n278 A/RES/73/266 p. 3 para. 3. \n279 A/RES/73/27, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (5 December 2018) para. 5. \n280 Ibid. \n61 \n62 \nSources \nBibliography \nArias, G.J., Are the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks?, Revista Tribuna Internacional, Volume 6, Issue 11 (2017). \nBanks, W, State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0., Texas Law Review, Volume 95, Issue 7 (June, 2017) pp. 1487-1514. \nBannelier-Christakis, K, Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?, Baltic Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 14 (2014). \nBarlow, J, A Declaration of Iessed 24 November 2019.

States are heavily dependent on the use of cyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, have similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of property.1 The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security.2 While these cyber operations fall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This raises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can deal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both regional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.3 \n\tCyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. First of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a significant level ofanonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. All of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State actors.4 Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute whether international law applies in cyberspace or not. \nFor example, Barlowexpressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace and that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d.5 These arguments assume that cyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is borderless.6 However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that cyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions \n1 Efrony & Shany p. 584. \n2 Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n3 See for example Commission (EC) and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, \u2018Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace\u2019 (joint communication) JOIN(2013) 1 final (7 February 2013) and Alexander Klimburg (ed.), National Cyber Security Framework Manual (NATO CCD COE 2012). \n4 Buchan p. 429. \n5 Barlow.\n6 See the discussion about this in Chapter 2.1. \n7 \ncould take place. Considering that the use of cyberspace to perform malicious cyber operations is becoming more common, not regulating does not seem to be a feasible option. In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, regulation is highly necessary. \nWhat most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject to international law.7 There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the application of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how international law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of international law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled. \n\tInternational law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different fora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the regulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0).8A Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to strengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems.9 The UN GGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015)10, before failing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.11 \n\tCustomary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is happening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. As an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a traditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support cyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States.12 Considerable difficulties exist in applying international law to cyberspace. \nAt the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility generally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State. Attributing cyber acts to States is difficult because of the special features of cyberspace and because many of \n7 See for example Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 13 and Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. See also Chapter 2.3. for a more in depth discussion. \n8 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations.\n9 A/RES/58/32, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (8 December 2003) p. 2 para. 4. \n10 A/68/98, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) (UN GGE 2013 Report) and A/70/174, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015) (UN GGE 2015 Report). 11 V\u00e4ljataga. \n12 Arias p. 2. \n8 \nthe actors in cyberspace consist of non-State actors. Therefore, it has been suggested that attribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations.13 \n\tHowever, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of States. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states that it is applicable to cyber operations.14 Due diligence is a principle in customary international law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States to not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.15 One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that the State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stopthe attack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace or not, and, if it does, to what extent. \n1.2Purpose of the study \nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed.\n1.3Delimitation \nDue diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal responsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of international organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State responsibility, but not relevantfor the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in order to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. \nJus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle applies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the use of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules about use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of the study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an armed attack.  However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed \n13 See Chapter 3.5 for a discussion about this. \n14 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. \n15 Compare Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22. \n9 \nif the due diligence principle is applicable. Other consequences of State responsibility will not be discussed. \nCyberspace is a technical area, but the technical aspects of cyber operations will be covered only in order to understand the problems of cyber operations and how due diligence works in relation to this.\n\tDue diligence is sometimes referred to with other names, for example the obligation of vigilance, the obligation of prevention, and the duty of prevention. I have decided to refer to it as simply due diligence, which is the terminology adopted in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.16 \n\tWhile the examination of the applicability of the due diligence principle is the focus of the study, the scope and the content of the principle will also be discussed in order to understand it. \n1.4Method and material \n1.4.1The dogmatic method and public international law \nTo examine the due diligence principle in cyberspace, I have used a dogmatic approach. There are many different definitions of the dogmatic method, but the main feature is that it attempts to analyze what the established law is, and to interpret the content of the legal sources in question.17 At the same time, this is a study of public international law. Public international law differs from domestic law as regards the method and the sources used. In international law, there is no \u201csingle body\u201d creating laws which are binding upon all States. 18 Neither is there a court system similar to the domestic court systems, that is able to interpret and extend the law in a comprehensive way. Furthermore, the sources of international law are different from the sources of domestic law. \nArticle 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ19 contains the most widely recognized authoritative and complete declaration of the sources of international law.20 The article states that \n16 See Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31 for a discussion about the terminology. \n17 See Lehrberg p. 201 and Hjertstedt p. 167. \n18 Shaw p. 49. \n19 United Nations, Statute of the International Court of Justice (18 April 1946). 20 Shaw p. 50. \n10 \n[t]he Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply: \na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting States; \nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; \nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; \nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law. \n\tThe sources of international law are thus: treaties, custom, general principles, judicial decisions and academic writings. The article is written as an instruction to the Court, but it is considered to be the general list of sources of international law. As stated in the article, judicial decisions and academic writings are subsidiary to the other sources. \tTreaties are based on the customary international law principle pacta sunt servanda, i.e. that agreements are binding.21 Some treaties have a general relevance, so called law-making treaties, while others function more like contracts and apply only between two or a few States.22 Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties23 lay down the general rules of interpretation of treaties. Article 31(1) states that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\nThe second source of international law mentioned in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICJ is international custom. Customary rules should constitute general practice accepted as law. From this it is possible to deduce two elements to customary rules \u2013 general practice and opinio juris.24 General State practice is the actual behavior of States. Opinio juris is the belief of States that such behavior is, in fact, law. \nShaw describes custom by saying that rules deciding what is allowed and what is not inevitably develop in all societies, even in primitive ones.25 These rules emerge \u201calmost \n21 Ibid p. 67. \n22 Ibid. \n23 United Nations, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Treaty Series, Volume 1155 (1969) p. 331. 24 The ICJ in Continental Shelf (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Malta), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1985, p. 13, para. 27 expressed that the substance of customary law must be \u201clooked for primarily in the actual practice and opinio juris of states\u201d. \n25 Shaw p. 51. \n11 \nsubconsciously\u201d and are upheld by \u201cthe members of the group by social pressures and with the aid of various other more tangible implements.\u201d26 He further states that \n[i]t reflects the consensus approach to decision-making with the ability of the majority to create new law binding upon all, while the very participation of States encourages their compliance with customary rules.27\nState practice needs to be established, widespread and consistent.28 It is a two-sided practice; \u201cone State asserts a right, either explicitly or by acting in a way that impliedly constitutes such an assertion, and the State or States affected by the claim then react either by objecting or by refraining from objection\u201d.29 If there is no protest regarding the claim, it is considered supported. However, if there is a protest \u201cit excludes the claim\u201d.30 As long as the State practice is widespread and consistent, it does not need to be the practice of every single State of the world. \n\tOpinio juris is the belief that a State activity is legally obligatory.31 States act in a certain way because they are of the belief that there is a legal obligation to do so. This has been confirmed, for example, by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases32, where the Court stated that \u201c[n]ot only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it\u201d.33 \tIn some cases, it is rather difficult to point to a distinct line between treaty and custom. For example, a treaty provision could establish the foundation of a rule which, together with opinio juris, may lead to the formation of a binding customary rule for all States, not only the ones party to the treaty.34 This was pointed out by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases where it was considered to be one of the established methods of creating new customary rules.35 However, it is not just any provision that can constitute customary law. According to the Court, the specific provision has to be \u201cof fundamentally \n26 Ibid. \n27 Ibid p. 52-53. \n28 International Law Commission, Draft Conclusions on identification of customary international law, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2019)p. 3 conclusion 8. 29 Ibid. \n30 Ibid. \n31 Ibid. \n32North Sea Continental Shelf cases (Federal Republic of Germany v.

One of the challenges when applying this method is to obtain material relevant to establish the scope of the customary rule. \n1.4.2The material and its relevance in this study \nDue diligence is first and foremost a rule of international customary law. It has developed through international case law. Therefore, case law will primarily be used to understand the principle. \nIt is difficult to obtain information about State practice and opinio juris regarding cyberspace. The reason for this is mainly because State cyber practice is usually classified, and an extremely small number of States have made public statements regarding their view on cyberspace.37  A few statements from States on the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace will be used in an attempt to establish State practice and opinio juris.\nThere are also a limited number of treaties on the area of due diligence and cyberspace. The few treaties that do deal with cyber operations are of very limited scope. Due diligence, on the other hand, can be observed in some treaties, mostly in the area of environmental law. These treaties of environmental law will be used as a comparison to due diligence in cyberspace. The main focus, although, will be on international customary law. \nFurthermore, several non-binding sources will be used to examine the due diligence rule and international law in cyberspace overall. The focus of the thesis is Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations. The Tallinn \nManual 2.0 is one of the most recent and prominent efforts at an \u201cobjective restatement of the lex lata\u201d concerning cyber operations.38 As already stated, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is not an official document or an official source of international law. It does not in any \n36 Ibid para. 72. \n37 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 38 Ibid. \n13 \nway represent States\u2019 view on applicable law in cyberspace. However, it is an effort to assess what the law is (lex lata) and should be credited some weight in the discussion. \tAs was mentioned already in the introduction, the UN created a Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) in 2004. The group has released two consensus reports39 which will also be used in the assessment of the due diligence principle in cyberspace. Although, of course, the reports are not similar to treaties, they do have considerable weight for cyber international law. \nFurthermore, the ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts40 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility) will be used in order to provide a background for the reader about the concept of State responsibility in public international law. Since the articles are not a treaty, they are not binding on any States. However, the United Nations Assembly commended the articles to member States in 2012 and they have also been repeatedly referred to by courts, tribunals, and other international bodies. \n\tFinally, academic writings, which have made a big contribution to establishing the content of due diligence in cyberspace, will be used. \n1.5Outline of the thesis \nThe thesis will, in Chapter 2, introduce the concept of cyber operations. Cyberspace will be defined, as will cyber operations. Thereafter, it will be discussed whether public international law is applicable in cyberspace. \nIn Chapter 3, State responsibility is discussed. It will be explained what it is and when States can be held responsible for international acts. Attribution will be explained and discussed shortly, and the focus will be on the problems of attributing cyber operations to a State. Countermeasures will also be covered here. \nChapter 4 examines due diligence. There will be an assessment into the history of this customary rule. Due diligence in environmental law will be examined and the conclusions in this subchapter will be used in order to understand due diligence in cyberspace. It will \n39 A/68/98, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (24 June 2013) and A/70/174, Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (22 July 2015). \n40 International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10). \n14 \nbe discussed whether due diligence applies to cyberspace and what scope the due diligence principle has. \nChapter 5 covers countermeasures which may be used in certain cases as a response to a cyber operation. The chapter discusses how and when countermeasures can be used in relation to the due diligence principle. \nFinally, Chapter 6 will provide a discussion of the conclusions from the study, reiterate the most important parts from the previous chapters and discuss what future initiatives there are relating to due diligence in cyberspace.\n15 \n16 \n2Cyber operations and international law \n2.1What is cyberspace? \nCyberspace has been defined as \u201ca global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\u201d.41 It is generally held that cyberspace is \u201cnot a physical place\u201d and that one of its characterizing features include anonymity.42 It has been compared to the high seas, international airspace and outer space, because it is sort of a \u201cglobal common\u201d.43 However, at the same time, cyberspace would not exist without certain physical components. The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, integrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on the territory of a State.44 Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems are built and operate\u201d.45 So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res communis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that cyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal one.46 The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may exercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.47 Additionally, while cyber acts may be international in that they cross multiple borders, they are still conducted by persons or entities which are subject to the jurisdiction of one or more States.48 \n\tThe rules of State responsibility, including due diligence, refers to \u201cterritory\u201d. In relation to cyberspace, territory is to be understood as the territory connected to the physical aspect of cyberspace. For example, this could be where the computer is located, or where the individual conducting the act is located. The rules may also refer to the cyber \n41 Tsagourias, The legal status of cyberspace p. 15. \n42 Von Heinegg p. 9. \n43 Ibid. \n44 Ibid. \n45 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 46 Ibid p. 12. \n47 Ibid. \n48 Ibid. \n17 \ninfrastructure of a State, which consequently is part of the physical layer and within the State\u2019s territory. Therefore, the view adopted by the International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is the premise used in this thesis.49 \n\tIt is also common to find references to ICTs, i.e. Information and Communication Technologies.50 There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is that ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or information\u201d.51 A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, wireless networks, and other communication technologies.52 ICT devices can be both the source of a misuse or the target of such.53\n2.2What is a cyber operation? \nThe due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. \tAccording to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity.54 A cyber activity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or employs means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d.55 Cyber operations are further defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\u201d.56 Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. A cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or \ndamage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d.57 The NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions58 provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, namely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer \n49 See Chapter 4.5.4 for a further discussion about territory and infrastructure in relation to the due diligence principle in cyberspace. \n50 This is for example the terminology primarily used in the UN GGE reports. \n51 United States of America, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies Explore Terms: A Glossary of Common Cybersecurity Terminology (28 November 2018). \n52 See for example Australia, Cyber Security Strategy (2009) p. 1 and Austria, Austrian Cyber Security Strategy (2013) p. 22. \n53 UN GGE 2013 Report p. 6 para. 5. \n54 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 564. 55 Ibid. \n56 Ibid. \n57 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 229. \n58 Voitasec p. 125. \n18 \nnetwork, or the computer and/or computer network itself\u201d. A mere intrusion into a computer system is not included in the term cyber attack.59 Rather, it is to be considered as cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law.60 \n\tHowever, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of cyber attacks.61 Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other words, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. For the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content of the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as formulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which is unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study. \tWhen discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will be used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. the State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose territory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is located, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber operation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in question. \nIt is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these cyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals with ideological motives.62 Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt software and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical infrastructures which are operated by computers63. Roscini gives examples of potential consequences of malicious cyber operations: \na cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.64\n\tCyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is important to know whether international law applies in cyberspace. \n59 Von Heinegg p. 16. \n60 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 5. 61 Voitasec p. 125. \n62 Roscini p. 2. \n63 Ibid. \n64 Ibid. \n19 \n2.3The applicability of international law to cyberspace \nAs has already been noted, cyberspace enjoys certain particular features. Cyberspace is borderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily accessible for many actors, including non-State actors.Because of the special character of cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public international law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view65 is that cyberspace is not within any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most generally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing else,if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless land. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts of acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal void, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security.\nFurthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur in cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind the cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more States. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international law as usual. \n\tThe introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law applies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has been acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.66 Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 further states that the principle of State sovereignty applies in cyberspace.67 Sovereignty is part of the foundation of international law and is included, for example, in the UN Charter.68 Sovereignty itself is highly connected to the concept of territory.69 \n\tFurthermore, Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of another State.70 It is prohibited in international law to prevent or disregard another State\u2019s exercise of its sovereignty, and this is true also for cyber operations.71 \n\tThe first consensus report released by the UN GGE in 2013 was highly proclaimed since it stated plainly that international law is applicable to cyberspace. At the same time, \n65 See for example Barlow. \n66 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 67 Ibid p. 11. \n68 See the United Nations, Charter of the United Nations, 1945, 1 UNTS XVI art. 2(1). 69 Shaw p. 352. \n70 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 17. 71 Ibid. \n20 \nhowever, it is clear from the second consensus report, in 2015, that there are many different views among the States on international law and the scope of its application. Furthermore, when concluding the last round of deliberations in 2017, it became clear that the UN GGE would not be able to reach consensus and could therefore not release a third consensus report. The task given by the General Assembly was to continue to study \u201chow international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour of States\u201d.72 Although there are obvious difficulties in the limitations of international rules in cyberspace, and States do not fully agree on the scope, it cannot be doubted that the UN GGE did reach consensus on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. \tIt must be concluded from the above that international law is indeed applicable to cyberspace. \n72 A/RES/70/237, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (23 December 2015). \n21 \n22 \n3State responsibility \n3.1Introduction \nIn order to understand the due diligence principle and how it works, some understanding of State responsibility is needed. State responsibility is a central principle of public international law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The principle stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one State commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State.73 State responsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of an international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and who may seek reparation or respond to the breach.74 \n\tThe International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 August 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft Articles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly in a resolution75 annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, which is an unusual procedure.76 Crawford describes the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as the \u201cmodern framework for State responsibility\u201d.77\n3.2The elements of State responsibility \nArticle 1 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility forms the foundation for State responsibility: \nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State. \nThe term \u201cinternationally wrongful act\u201d is aimed to include all wrongful acts of a State, regardless of if it originates from a positive action or from an omission or a failure to act. According to the Commentary, there are as many cases where State responsibility has \n73 Shaw p. 566. \n74 Crawford & Olleson p. 443. \n75 A/RES/56/83, Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (12 December 2001). 76 Shaw p. 568. There was even talk about turning them into a convention. \n77 Crawford p. 45. \n23 \nbecome relevant because of an omission as cases where the wrongful act arises from a positive obligation.78 \n\tArticle 1 is the general rule of State responsibility, which is commonly supported by practice.79 Article 2 states that the internationally wrongful act of a State must be attributable to the State and must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. The principle in Article 2 has been confirmed by case law.80 \n\tAttribution will be covered in Chapter 3.4. According to Article 12 in the ILC articles on State Responsibility, there is a breach of an international obligation when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character. In other words, what is a breach depends on what the international obligation is.81 \n\tOne may notice that any preconditions about \u201cfault\u201d by the State or \u201cdamage\u201d suffered by an injured State is missing from article 1.82 There has been a debate in the legal literature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective responsibility\u201d.83 Case law generally support the latter.84 However, Crawford & Olleson holds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation includes it at a necessary condition.85 The same could be said about the question of whether some kind of harm or damage is necessary.86 The Rainbow Warrior case87 established that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally wrongful act.88 \n\tAccording to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled as an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached is owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the international community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must specifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the position of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation. \n78 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 35. \n79 Shaw p. 569 \n80 Ibid. \n81 Crawford & Olleson p. 447. \n82 Crawford p. 49. \n83 Crawford & Olleson p. 462. \n84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid. \n86 Ibid. \n87Rainbow Warrior Case, (New Zealand v.

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. This element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not the one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of the State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials.91 The rules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself. \tThere are three general attribution standards.92 Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\nThe second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility is that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit would in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed\u201d.93\n89Final Award \u2013 Ethiopia\u2019s Damages Claims between the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the State of Eritrea, Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission (17 August 2009) para. 35.

United States of America), Merits, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1986, p. 14 para. 115 [emphasis added] [hereinafter the Nicaragua case]. \n25 \nFinally, Article 9 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered as an act of the State under international law if the person or group was in fact exercising elements of the governmental authority in the absence or default of the official authorities and in circumstances such as to call for the exercise of those elements of authority. \nThis is not a complete examinationof the rules of attribution, but it presents the foundation of attribution and explains the main ways of attributing acts. The main reason for introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation to cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter. \n3.4The problems of attribution in cyberspace \nAs has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for establishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations produce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been described as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d.94 Attribution is an issue which is often discussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of international cyber law.\n\tAttribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important matter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation.95 However, identifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution in cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.96 \n\tFirst, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This is not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to it. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the computer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address so that it is not trackable. Not only that,but if the actor uses a network modification technique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in fact is.97\n94 Banks p. 1493. \n95 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 230. 96 Chircop p. 646. \n97 Ibid. \n26 \n\tThe second part of the problem, which is perhaps even more daunting, is that it is necessary to identify the person, or the group, operating the computer. Attribution attempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if the location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the person behind the act can be identified.98 \n\tFinally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established and the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus between the actor and the State.99 The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find a \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the injury suffered\u201d.100 The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide.101 \n\tTsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber operation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several computers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated by different people.102 Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber operations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further states that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful.103 \tAll of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States responsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the risk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able to use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack. \n3.5Countermeasures \nThe international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign and equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If that happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State breaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as countermeasures. \n98 Ibid. \n99 Ibid. \n100Bosnian Genocide para. 462. \n101 Ibid. \n102 Tsagourias, Cyber attacks, self-defence and the problem of attribution p. 233. 103 Ibid p. 230. \n27 \n\tArticle 22 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that the wrongfulness of an act is precluded if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure.In the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case, the ICJ stated that a countermeasure has to meet certain conditions in order to be justifiable.104 First, the countermeasure must be taken in response to a previous international wrongful act of another State and must be directed against that State.105 Secondly, the injured State must have called upon the State committing the wrongful act to discontinue its wrongful conduct or to make reparation for it.106 In the view of the Court, an important consideration is that the effects of a countermeasure must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking account of the rights in question.107 Furthermore, the Court stated that another condition for the lawfulness of a countermeasure is that its purpose must be to induce the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under international law, and that the measure must therefore be reversible.108 \n\tCountermeasures are dealt with in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 49 states the object and limits of countermeasures and the first paragraph provides that an injured State may only take countermeasures against a State which is responsible for an internationally wrongful act in order to induce that State to comply with its obligations under the draft articles. Countermeasures are limited to the non-performance for the time being of international obligations of the State taking the measures and shall, as far as possible, be taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligation in question. Obligations not affected by countermeasures are covered in Article 50 which makes it clear that countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied by the UN Charter109, obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals and other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law. \n\tCountermeasures in relation to the due diligence principle will be further discussed in Chapter 5. \n104Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1997, p. 7, para. 83. 105 Ibid. \n106 Ibid. \n107 Ibid para. 84. \n108 Ibid para. 87. \n109 Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. \n28 \n4Due diligence \n4.1Introduction \nThere are two different ways in which States can be held responsible. The first one is by attribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in previous chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence principle. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the due diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, military responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the threshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate. \n\tThis disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber operations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more common with peacetime cyber operations.110 It is also a fact that many of the authors of cyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are generally not ableto be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, usually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have international responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent the act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, not the direct result of the actions of private individuals.111 Attribution and due diligence have previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility.112 \n\tDue diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the context and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle in Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, its development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in the field of cyberspace. \n4.2The history of due diligence \nAs has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that their territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State. In the 17th century, \n110 Geiss & Lahmann p. 657. \n111 Crawford & Olleson p. 456. \n112 Hessbrueggep. 268. \n29 \nGrotius established the foundation of the concept of due diligence.113 However, it would take until the 19th century before due diligence began to assume its current form and to impose a duty on States.114 In the early days, because of the increased movement of people across territorial borders, due diligence became important for the protection of aliens.115 For example, Justice Moore observed in the SS Lotus Case that \u201cit is well settled that a State is bound to use due diligence to prevent the commission within its dominions of criminal acts against another nation or its people\u201d.116 \n\tThe concept of State sovereignty also emerged stronger during the 19th centuryand led to a requirement of States to protect \u201cthe security of other States in times of peace and war\u201d.117 The principle of sovereignty is well-established in international law and means that States are prohibited from violating the sovereignty of another State. The principle of sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence is derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty was interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States.118 Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d.119 If a State enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there needs to be a corresponding legal obligation. \nThe term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. \nThe commentary to Art. 2 states that \nWhether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on the circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. The articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other standards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence or want of due diligence. Such standards vary from one context to another for \n113 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, First Report (7 March 2014) p. 2. \n114 Ibid. \n115 Ibid. \n116SS Lotus (France v Turkey), 1927 PCIJ (Ser.

For example, in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case (1941)127, which concerned an environmental dispute between the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that \nunder the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.128\nThe Tribunal accepted a due diligence standard in order to limit transboundary damage. There was not much international precedent for the Tribunal to use in its assessment. Instead, the Tribunal turned to domestic decisions for inspiration and it refers to the \n120 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 34. \n121 Koivurova para. 7. \n122 ILC Articles on State Responsibility p. 39. \n123 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 5.

Canada, 3 UNRIAA 1905 (1938 and 1941). 128 Ibid p. 1965. \n31 \ndecisions of the Supreme Court of the United States as the basis of its conclusions.129 The Tribunal held that the Dominion of Canada, according to international law, was responsible for the conduct of the Trail Smelter.130 It further decided that the Trail Smelter should be required to refrain from causing any damage through fumes in the State of Washington and to fix the indemnity of such damage. \nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision has, however, received some criticism. It is claimed that the \nTribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international principle.131 While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that the obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal only expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One might claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to the specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the development of due diligence in environmental law is examined.\nNevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case law. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle outside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel casetried the State responsibility regarding \nthe laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held Albania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their omission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d.132 The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle. Corfu Channel has been said to best articulate the general principle of due diligence.133 \tFurthermore, in its Advisory Opinion to the UN General Assembly on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons134, the ICJ stated that \u201c[t]he existence of the general obligation of States to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction and control \n129 Miller, Trail Smelter Arbitration para 7. \n130Trail Smelter Arbitration, United States v. Canada, 3 UNRIAA 1905 (1938 and 1941) p. 1965. 131 Miller para. 7. \n132Corfu Channel case, Judgment of April 9th, 1949: ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4, p. 22.\n133 Chircop p. 649. \n134Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, p. 226 [hereinafter Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion]. \n32 \nrespect the environment of other States or of areas beyond national control is now part of the corpus of international law relating to the environment\u201d.135 \n\tThe rise of transnational terrorism has further raised the attention of the doctrine of due diligence. The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that the Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective measures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations or camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or their citizens.136 \n\tThere are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although the term itself is at times absent. This is especially true for international treaty law.137 There are exceptions, such as the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women138, whichexplicitly includes due diligence in article 5. Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. Nonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law. It is also particularly well suited as a tool for responding to complicated legal situations of responsibility in newer, more complex, areas such as cyberspace.139 \n\tAccording to an ILA study group on due diligence, the principle \u201cis now clearly a part of customary international law, and reflects cornerstone concepts of international law (including State sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference)\u201d.140 They explain the particular position of due diligence in international law by describing its desirable features; it is a concept by which States can observe specific behavioral standards, or intend to accomplish specific outcomes, but without specifying the exact result or timeframe by which this is supposed to occur.141 It is generally true, that the more general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time. Therefore, it is not surprising that due diligence remains a prominent standard of influential law and that its use has spread, and is still spreading, to other areas of international law besides environmental law. \n135 Ibid p. 242. \n136 UN SC Res. 1267 (15 October 1999); UN SC Res. 1333 (19 December 2000). \n137 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 6. \n138Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, CETS No. 210 (11 May 2011). \n139 International Law Association, Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law, Second Report (July 2016) p. 2. \n140 Ibid p. 5. \n141 Ibid. \n33 \n4.3Due diligence in environmental law \nDue diligence has seen the most development in the field of environmental law. Because of this, the use of due diligence in environmental law serves as a good yardstick when assessing the due diligence principle in the cyber context. Therefore, the application and scope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter. \n In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of international treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment\u201d.142 Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. Shaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally as the most appropriate one\u201d.143 At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due diligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation prescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other relevant treaties.144 But at other times, the matter is more uncertain.145 Nonetheless, the prevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. Due diligence is necessarily a huge part of this. \nArticle 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities146, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk \nthereof\u201d.\nThe Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: \nThe obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization measures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that will determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the present articles. The duty of due diligence involved, however, is not intended to guarantee that significant harm be totally prevented, if it is not possible to do so. In that eventuality, the State of origin is required \u2026 to exert its best \n142 UN General Assembly, Convention on the Law of the Sea (10 December 1982) [hereinafter UNCLOS]. 143 Shaw p. 621. \n144 Ibid. \n145 Ibid. \n146 International Law Commission, Draft articles on Prevention on Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Volume II, Part Two (2001). \n34 \npossible efforts to minimize the risk. In this sense, it does not guarantee that the harm would not occur.147\nThe Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of conduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The State simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills its due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS similarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable means at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not stated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating prevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a stricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. What is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness included in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its obligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, for example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, or use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly expressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do. \nThe cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. The Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case concerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the United States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States and a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the reference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence.148 Because the actor was a private company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, the State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its territory in a manner injurious to other States. \nAs recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that \nis required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental statement in Corfu Channel.149 The Court went on to state that a State is \u201cobliged to use \n147 Ibid para. 7. \n148 See Chapter 4.2. \n149Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v Uruguay), ICJ Reports 2010, p. 14, para. 101 [hereinafter Pulp Mills]. \n35 \nall the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.150 Note that, similarly to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, the Court included \u201cdamage\u201d as a criterium for due diligence to apply.\nA relevant question is whether the principle adopted in the environmental case law can be extended to other areas of international law. It is possible, for example, to argue that the Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle should be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes. However, this argument does not stand considering that the obligation of due diligence existed already prior to the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, and that, since then, it has been developed both in environmental law and in other areas of international law. \nIt is also true that due diligence is a flexible concept, which has to be adapted due to the specific circumstances in every case. States are required to \u201ctake preventive action in relation to foreseeable harm, that is, when they possess scientific evidence that significant transboundary damage is likely.\u201d151 The due diligence standard varies according to context. There is not one standard of due diligence which applies to all primary rules.152 This was confirmed by the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion.153 The Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion (2011)154concerned the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga who both put forward applications for approval of a plan of work for exploration in the area reserved for the conduct of activities by the Seabed Mining Authority. The Area means the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.155  The Council of the International Seabed Authority submitted the Advisory Opinion to the Seabed Disputes Chamber and requested that the Chamber rendered an advisory opinion on certain questions of, inter alia, legal responsibilities and obligations of States. The Chamber therefore had the opportunity to add to the case law of due diligence. It stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over \n150 Ibid. \n151 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n152 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 20. \n153 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 26. \n154Responsibilities and obligations of States with respect to activities in the Area, Advisory Opinion, 1 February 2011, ITLOS Reports 2011, p. 10 [hereinafter the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion]. \n155 See UNCLOS art. 1 para. 1(1). \n36 \ntime \u201cas measures considered sufficiently diligent at a certain moment may become not diligent enough in light, for instance, of new scientific or technological knowledge\u201d.156 \tFurthermore, the standard of due diligence may depend on the risk of the activities. In Pulp Mills, the Court found that \u201cit may now be considered a requirement under general international law to undertake an environmental impact assessment where there is a risk that the proposed industrial activity may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource\u201d.157  The use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua158, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent significant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural obligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to notify and consult the potentially affected State.159 \n\tThe Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be divided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary harm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an EIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.160 Finally, if there is a confirmed risk of significant transboundary harm by the EIA, \u201cthe State \nplanning to undertake the activity is required \u2026 to notify and consult in good faith with the potentially affected State, where that is necessary to determine the appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate the risk\u201d.161 In other words, the three steps are risk ascertainment, risk assessment, and notification or consultation. By contrast, if the State determines that no risk exists, there is no need to carry out an EIA or to notify or consult the affected State. However, these steps have also been criticized for oversimplifying the obligation of due diligence. In her separate opinion, Judge Donoghue stated that \u201cthe Judgment could be read to suggest that there is only one circumstance in which the State of origin must notify potentially affected States\u201d, i.e. when a need to do an EIA has been established.162 The due diligence obligation, however, might not be limited to this one circumstance. It is, for example, possible to imagine a scenario in which a State is aware \n156Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion para. 117. \n157Pulp Mills para 204. \n158Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2015, p. 665 [hereinafter Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua]. \n159 Ibid para. 104. \n160 Ibid. \n161 Ibid. \n162 Ibid, Separate Opinion of Judge Donoghue p. 788, para. 21. \n37 \nof a potential risk which warrants notifying potentially affected States, but where there is no need to do an EIA. The State might also need the input of a potentially affected State in order to carry out the EIA. \nThe damage needs to be established \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d, as emphasized by the tribunal in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case.163 This is true for all issues regarding State responsibility, not only the due diligence principle.164 The due diligence obligation also must be foreseeable for States. \n\tThe ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.165 This suggests that it is not enough to fulfil the due diligence obligation to claim that a State did not have actual knowledge. It must also be established whether the State had constructive knowledge.166 \n\tInternational environmental law has significantly helped in the understanding of the notion of due diligence. However, it remains unclear how much the particulars of due diligence in environmental law can be used to establish the content of the principle in other areas of international law. More specifically, the question for the following chapters is how our knowledge of due diligence so far can help in the assessment of the due diligence principle applicable to cyber operations. \n4.4The applicability of due diligence in cyberspace \nAs cyberspace was emerging, a pressing issue was whether international law, and, more specifically, the prohibition on violation of sovereignty applied to cyberspace as well. As has already been discussed, there is now a general consensus that it does apply to cyberspace. Does this mean that due diligence is also applicable in cyberspace? \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0 \u2013 yes. The manual clearly states that it considers its rules to be reflecting the law as it is (lex lata).167 The International Group of Experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 explains that new technologies are \u201csubject to pre-existing international law absent a legal exclusion therefrom\u201d and argue that this means that the due diligence principle applies in cyberspace. 168The argument therefore goes that since due diligence is to be considered a general principle of international law, it is presumed \n163Trail Smelter Arbitration p. 1965. \n164 See Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission as referenced in Chapter 3.2. \n165Corfu Channel p. 18. \n166 See a further discussion about constructive knowledge in Chapter 4.5.5. \n167 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 3. 168 Ibid p. 31, with reference to the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion para. 39. \n38 \nthat it is applicable to cyberspace unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it. At this moment, there is no such conclusive State practice or opinio juris. On the contrary, several States have expressed both that customary international law applies to cyberspace and that due diligence is among these customary rules.\n\tFor example, the White house stated, in its International Strategy for Cyberspace (2011), that \u201c[t]he development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render existing international norms obsolete. Long-standing international norms guiding state behavior \u2013 in times of peace and conflict \u2013 also apply in cyberspace\u201d.169 \n\tThe French ministry of defense published a document in September 2019, describing its views on how international law applies in cyberspace.170 France, by reference to the 2015 UN GGE consensus report, declared that sovereignty over computer systems on the State\u2019s territory creates a customary obligation of due diligence and that the duty means that the State should not \u201cknowingly allow its territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICT\u201d.171 \n\tIn July 2019, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a letter172 to the parliament, explained the view of the Government on international law\u2019s applicability in cyberspace. The Annex to the letter, referring to Corfu Channel, and noting that not all countries agree that due diligence is an obligation in its own right in international law, clearly states that the Netherlands views the principle as an obligation in its own right.173 Violating the principle therefore constitutes an internationally wrongful act.174 \n\tMost State documents, however, stay quiet on the topic of due diligence obligations and avoid connecting it to the attribution problematics.175 Nonetheless, V\u00e4ljataga says that it is possible to detect notions of States\u2019 views on due diligence in these documents.176 Partly by looking at national cyber security strategies, she draws a speculative conclusion that States \u201cagree that cyber due diligence follows from cyber sovereignty\u201d but that they \u201chave not agreed on whether and how cyber due diligence can form the basis for state \n169 The White House, International Strategy for Cyberspace: Prosperity, Security and Openness in a Networked World (Washington, 2011) p. 9. \n170 Roguski. \n171 Roguski. \n172 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019). \n173 Ibid Appendix p. 4. \n174 Ibid. \n175 V\u00e4ljataga, Tracing opinio juris in National Cyber Security Strategy Documents p. 8. \n176 Ibid. \n39 \nresponsibility\u201d.177 At the same time, the strategy documents seem to recognize the obligations and responsibilities deriving from sovereignty.178 Since due diligence is an obligation deriving from sovereignty, States still seem open to the fact that it is applicable to cyberspace, although the scope of its applicability is not clear.\nIt was also affirmed by the UN General Assembly, already in 2001, that States should take preventive measures in cyberspace.179 The UN General Assembly encouraged States \nto \u201censure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u201d.180 \n\tFurthermore, the UN GGE\u2019s have expressed that principles of international law that \u201cflow\u201d from the principle of sovereignty are binding in the cyber context.181 Since due diligence is a principle which derives from the principle of sovereignty, this statement should include due diligence. Additionally, the UN GGE included in its 2015 report the recommendation that \u201cStates should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u201d.182 \n\tAt the same time, however, those who do not believe due diligence to be applicable in the context of cyber operations have used the UN GGE as an argument against its applicability.183 In their reports, the Experts stated that States \u201cshould\u201d observe the due diligence principle, rather than that they \u201cmust\u201d.184 Nevertheless, according to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the GGE\u2019s statements do not \u201cdefinitively refute the existence of such a principle\u201d.185 \n\tWhile there is considerable evidence which points to the fact that due diligence should be considered applicable in the cyber context, it is a fact that not all States have accepted due diligence as customary law, especially not in cyberspace.186 States are reluctant to credit the due diligence principle with a lex lata status. Considering that cyberspace still has to be seen as a new area of international law, this is not surprising. It is difficult, however, to draw any conclusions as to what States will say about the due diligence principle. Here it is relevant to point out that State practice must be widespread and \n177 Ibid p. 9. \n178 Ibid p. 18. \n179 A/RES/55/63, Combating the criminal misuse of information technologies (4 December 2000) p. 2. 180 Ibid. \n181 UN GGE 2013 Report para 20. \n182 UN GGE 2015 Report para. 13(c). Compare also para. 28(e). \n183 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 184 UN GGE 2013 Report, para 23; UN GGE 2015 Report paras. 13(c), 28(e). \n185 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 31. 186 Hankinson.\n40 \nconsistent, but that it does not need to be the practiceof every State in order to be a customary rule. Considering the few statements that do exist, or have been made public about due diligence, it is not enough to establish such State practice or opinio juris. \tAlthough it cannot be predicted whether State practice and opinio juris will confirm or deny the applicability of due diligence to cyberspace, the argument of this thesis is that the principle should be treated as applicable to cyberspace. This also follows the prerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of international law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is such a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the area of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context. It is my view that due diligence will be applicable, in one way or another, in cyberspace. The main question to be answered is what the content of the applicable principle will be. \n4.5The scope of due diligence \n4.5.1General notes about the scope \nRule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle in cyberspace: \nA State must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.187\n\tThe basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise due diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not used to harm other States\u201d.188 The International Group of Experts have used the commonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct expected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.189 \n\tThe due diligence principle applies to all third party cyber operations. It does not matter if the cyber operation is carried out by a private person, a corporation, a non-State actor, or a State.190\n187 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 30. 188 Ibid. \n189 Ibid. \n190 Ibid p. 32. \n41 \nOne of the concerns about the due diligence principle is that the principle would put an unreasonable burden on States. In this section, it will be shown that that is not the case. It will cover the different criteria of due diligence in order to understand the scope of the principle. \n4.5.2Internationally wrongful act and affecting a right \nIn order for the due diligence principle to come into play, the cyber operation needs to amount to an internationally wrongful act.191 This may not seem so implausible, since it would not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation if the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example regarding this.192 If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using cyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to terminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber espionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law.193 \n\tThe International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only \napplies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its territory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the territorial State itself\u201d.194 \n\tHowever, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in the due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts amounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State actors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful acts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. The International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle applies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the cyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target State.195 This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the conduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.196 Considering that \n191 Ibid p. 34. \n192 Ibid p. 35. \n193 See Rule 32 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 168. \n194 Ibid p. 35. \n195 See Chapter 4.5.3 regarding the \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d criterium. \n196 See for example the Trail Smelter Arbitration case where it was the actions of a private company which made the due diligence obligation come into play. \n42 \nthere are many non-State actors in cyberspace (similar to in environmental law), it would not be reasonable to exclude these from the scope of the principle. What the International Group of Experts also concluded is that there is no convincing argument for excluding non-State actors from the due diligence obligation.197 Especially since the due diligence principle is particularly well suited for these types of situations. \nBesides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to affect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One example of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. Since non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if the non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes the target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in question. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company publishes highly classified documents of the target State online.198 The due diligence principle will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target State is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a private company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the documents itself. This is true even if the publishing of the documents produces serious adverse consequences for the target State. \n4.5.3Serious adverse consequences \nWhile the ILC Articles of State Responsibility does not include any prerequisites about fault or harm, this is not the case for due diligence in the field of cyberspace. Similarly to environmental law, cyberspace is somewhat concerned with transboundary harm. The harm is, of course, rather different, but the aim is the same. Cyber operations could potentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental entities.199 The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations when the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. The criteria \u201cserious adverse consequences\u201d was included in Rule 6 by analogy from the content of the due diligence principle in international environmental \n197 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 36. 198 Ibid. \n199 See for example Bannelier-Christakis p. 3. \n43 \nlaw.200 In the Trail Smelter Arbitration case, it was stated that it needed to be \u201cof serious consequence\u201d, and the ICJ in Pulp Mills held that the conduct had to amount to \u201csignificant damage\u201d for another State. The threshold of the damage is not evident, but it is clear from the case law presented above that just any damage is not enough. The International Group of Experts concluded that it is not enough if the cyber operation is, for example, simply causing inconvenience or minor disruption, i.e. it is not enough that the conduct produces negative effects for the target State.201 \n\tStatesalso seem to be accepting this standard, albeit it is of course too soon to tell. The Netherlands stated in its letter that it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the due diligence principle applies only if the state whose right or rights have been violated suffers sufficiently serious adverse consequences\u201d.202 Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends on the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.203 This is also in line with both the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the flexibility of the principle. The International Group of Experts states a major impact on the economy as an example of serious adverse consequences which do not consist of physical damage.204 \n\tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also presents a potential problem occurring when the threshold of serious adverse consequences is used. If a hacker group in State A uses botnets205 that are placed in several States in order to conduct operations against State B, the cyber operation may cause serious adverse consequences for State B.206 However, this does not mean that the bots in the territory of one of the States alone produce serious adverse consequences. The issue here is whether the territorial States are violating the due diligence principle if they do not act to terminate the use of their territories by the hacker group. The International Group of Experts were split on how to treat this issue. While a few suggested that it would be a violation, it was pointed out by the majority that such a view would put the due diligence obligation in the perspective of the target State, rather than the territorial States. Instead, they claimed that due diligence \u201cderives from the \n200 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 37. 201 Ibid. \n202 Minister of Foreign Affairs, Letter to parliament on the international legal order in cyberspace + Appendix: International law in cyberspace (26 September 2019) p. 5. \n203 Ibid. \n204 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. 205 Definition of botnet according to the Glossary in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 563 is a \u201cnetwork of compromised computers, so-called \u2018bots\u2019, remotely controlled by an intruder, \u2018the botherder\u2019, used to conduct coordinated cyber operations, such as \u2018distributed denial of service\u2019 operations\u201d. \n206 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 38. \n44 \nsovereign prerogatives of the territorial State\u201d.207 A consequence of following the minority\u2019s line could also be that States might be held responsible for the omissions of other States. Nonetheless, the International Group of Experts agreed that as long as the harm suffered by a State meets the relevant threshold, it does not matter where that harm manifests.208\n4.5.4Territory and cyber infrastructure \nAccording to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the due diligence principle is applicable for activities on the sovereign territory of the territorial State.209 However, in two cases, the obligation may extend extraterritorially.210 The first case is when a State has control over a territory abroad without exercising sovereignty over it, which may be the case during military occupation for example. The second case is when a State has control over government cyber infrastructure abroad. This could be, for example, \u201ca national mission network on a military installation in a foreign country, cyber infrastructure aboard sovereign platforms on the high seas or in international airspace, and cyber infrastructure in diplomatic premises\u201d.211 \n\tThe author of the cyber operation is not necessarily located in the State bound by the due diligence obligation. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the following scenario: \nAs an example, consider a hacker group located in State A that carries out a destructive cyber operation against State B using cyber infrastructure located in State C. If State C knows of said usage and fails to take feasible measures to put an end to the operation, it is in violation of the due diligence principle.212\n\tIn this case, State C is the territorial State of the due diligence obligation, since the cyber infrastructure is located in State C.\nThere was some discussion among the International Group of Experts whether the due diligence principle should apply to transit States or not.213 A transit State is a State through which only data transits, e.g. through a fibre optic cable. Although hesitantly, they concluded that it did apply if the transit State had knowledge of the cyber operation, if \n207 Ibid. \n208 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 39. \n209 Ibid p. 32 \n210 Ibid. \n211 Ibid p. 33. \n212 Ibid p. 32. \n213 Ibid p. 33. \n45 \nthe cyber operation reaches the relevant threshold of harm and the transit State is able to take feasible measures to effectively terminate the operation. Bannelier-Christakis adds to this and states that there is \u201cno legal reason\u201d that transit States do not have to abide by the due diligence obligation.214 If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going to cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this attack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks.215 At the same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for violating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, but also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had knowledge of these actions.216 The International Group of Experts came to the same conclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be able to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure.217 However, if they do have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an obligation to do so. \n4.5.5Knowledge \nA State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have knowledge of the situation which obliges action.218 The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case made it clear that the obligation to notify shipping of the existence of mines was dependent on the State having obtained knowledge of that fact in sufficient time before the date when the vessels were struck by the mines.219 It would not be reasonable to hold a State responsible for something it was not aware of. The Court further stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its \nterritory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d about the circumstances.220 In other words, States do not have an absolute knowledge of everything that is happening on their territory. However, it may be reasonable to ask of a State to \u201cuse best effort to gain knowledge of activity within its territory or jurisdiction\u201d.221\n214 Bannelier-Christakis p. 6. \n215 Ibid. \n216 Ibid. \n217 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. 218 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n219Corfu Channel p. 22. \n220 Ibid p. 18. \n221 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 12. \n46 \nWhether it can be considered reasonable or not, however, does depend on the circumstances of each situation. \nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 states that as soon as the territorial State has knowledge of the cyber operation, the State must take all reasonably available measures to stop that cyber operation.222 The International Group of Experts stated that it is \u201ca constitutive element in the application of this Rule\u201d.223 There is nothing controversial about the due diligence applying for actual knowledge. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State having actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber operation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about such a cyber operation.224 The main problem here is, of course, proving that the State had such knowledge. \nA more difficult question is whether due diligence is applicable also in cases of constructive knowledge, i.e. when States should have known about a cyber operation. The International Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive knowledge.225 This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in question, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still applies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to certain cases of constructive knowledge. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case clearly stated that Albania \u201cought to or should have known\u201d.226 This definitely seems to include constructive knowledge in the due diligence principle. \nDetermining whether the State should have known about the cyber operation is another issue. On this point, the International Group of Experts stated that there is a range of factors at play.227 For example, they held that it is more likely that the State will meet the \u201cshould have known\u201d standard if the State\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure is being used, rather than if a private infrastructure is being used.228 Likewise, if the cyber operation is of the type that is generally always detected, it is easier to ascribe the State to have had constructive knowledge.229 The International Group of Experts were very clear, however, that in some cases, especially concerning more difficult cyber operations, \n222 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 43. 223 Ibid p. 40. \n224 Ibid. \n225 Ibid p. 41. \n226Corfu Channel p. 18. \n227 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 228 Ibid. \n229 Ibid. \n47 \nit might be unreasonable to expect the State to have known about it.230 Once again, the principle shows that it is not being unreasonable in what is required of States. \n4.5.6Reasonableness and the flexibility of the due diligence principle \nIn the introduction to this chapter, it was stated that the due diligence principle does not impose an unreasonable burden on States. This has already been made clear from the way it is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that it is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described as providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct.231 It is a flexible concept, and it only prescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result.232 This is not uncommon for international law since it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their behavior.233 The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it could reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in environmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible. It has further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that the principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. \tWhat is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the due diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the circumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also imply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber operation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for example, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of bona fide acts.234 The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that States only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d.235 Additionally, it is clear already from the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of prevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts \n230 Ibid. \n231 See for example the ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 8. \n232 Bannelier-Christakis p. 11.\n233 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 2. \n234 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n235United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1980, p. 3, para. 68.\n48 \nobligations, requiring States to take all reasonable or necessary measures to prevent a given event from occurring, but without warranting that the event will not occur\u201d.236 \tAnother way of expressing the reasonableness standard is to understand it as a requirement of conduct which would be the standard by any reasonable State in the prevailing circumstances.237 Although the standard of reasonableness does not have any clear content or criteria, general guidelines from other areas of international law, such as international environmental law, can be used to establish the scope of the principle. \tThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 also includes reasonableness throughout their commentary on Rule 6. For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable to expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant circumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been breached\u201d.238 The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance with the due diligence principle, which states that \n[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a right of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.239\n\tRule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in order to prevent or stop the attack. \nThe ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that developing States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar manner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have breached their due diligence obligation\u201d.240 Developing States may therefore be permitted to use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are taken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle. \nNaturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. Reasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be expected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements of what is expected of States. Nonetheless, it can be concluded that due diligence will not become an unreasonable burden for States.\n236 ILC articles on State Responsibility p. 62. \n237 Geiss & Lahmann p. 653. \n238 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 41. 239 Ibid p. 43. \n240 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 27. \n49 \n4.5.7The measures adopted \nAnother question is what exactly States need to do in order to fulfil their due diligence obligation. Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this question. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken reasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States.241 A State will not be said to have violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting its cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some sort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the means to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence obligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another State. The fact that the territorial State did not take any measures does not matter if there are no consequences. \nThe ILA study group on due diligence generally stated that the degree of due diligence varies depending on the primary rule in question.242 It is yet to be ascertained the degree of due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and have already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to be an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation of States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of their cyber infrastructure.243 The International Group of Experts concluded that the due diligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory.244 However, this is not undisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does imply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.245 Here it is worth pointing to the Alabama case, where the Tribunal found that \u201c[t]he British government failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and official representations made by the diplomatic agents \n241 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 3. \n242 Ibid p. 20. \n243 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n244 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 42. 245 Bannelier-Christakis p. 8. \n50 \nof the United States [\u2026], to take in due time any effective measures of prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the vessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable\u201d.246 The ICJ, inthe Corfu Channel case, further held that \u201cnothing was attempted by the Albanian authorities to prevent the disaster. These grave omissions involve the international responsibility of Albania\u201d.247 The ICJ stated that Albania neither notified the existence of the minefield, nor warned the British warships of the danger they were approaching, even though they had knowledge of it. In the latter case of Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo, the ICJ stated that Uganda was responsible \u201cfor any lack of vigilance preventing violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law by other actors present in the occupied territory, including rebel groups acting on their own account\u201d.248 Simply notifying the target State may not always be enough. According to the Tallinn Manual 2.0, States are required to use all means at its disposal to terminate the activity.249 \n\tSome further comments can be made about what the due diligence obligation in cyberspace includes. The due diligence principle does not make a difference between a situation in peacetime and during conflict. However, the due diligence requirements \nexpected of States during peacetime, may \u201cbecome more difficult to meet during conflict\u201d.250 There are also other rules that will come into play.251 The standard of due diligence continues to apply, nonetheless.\n\tFurthermore, the due diligence obligationis only concerned with ongoing operations.252 The duty to apply due diligence expires when the cyber operation is complete. That is, unless the cyber operation is likely to be repeated.253 \n\tEnvironmental law can also be used as a comparison here. In Chapter 4.3, the due diligence principle in the more developed area of environmental law was shown to require certain specific measures in some circumstances. For example, in Pulp Mills, it was \n246Alabama claims of the United States of America against Great Britain, Award rendered on 14 September 1872 by the tribunal of arbitration established by Article I of the Treaty of Washington of 8 May 1871, Volume XXIX, pp. 125-134, p. 130. [emphasis added]. \n247Corfu Channel p. 23. [emphasis added]. \n248Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2005, p. 168, para. 179. [emphasis added]. \n249 See for example Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 34. \n250 ILA Study Group, First Report p. 11. \n251 For example Rule 153 in Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 560 about response by parties to the conflict to violations. \n252 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 75. \n253 Ibid. \n51 \nestablished that it might be necessary to do an EIA, the use of which was later further developed in Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua. In the Seabed Mining Advisory Opinion, the Seabed Disputes Chamber stated that due diligence is a variable concept and that it may change over time, for example due to new scientific or technological knowledge. Cyberspace is an entire new technological area, and from what has been described of the principle above, it is only logical that the principle needs to be adapted to fit into this area of international law. It may be possible to imagine that the due diligence principle in cyberspace would also include some sort of \u201cEIA\u201d, that is, a method of assessing the risk of harm caused by a cyber operation, and that, if such a risk is confirmed, there will be a need to notify and consult the State that may be affected. Indeed, some authors argue that States should be required to conduct a cyber impact assessment.254 However, such an assessment may be more difficult than an EIA, since the operations generally occur with more rapidity than in the environmental area. What is required of States, therefore, necessarily differs from what the due diligence principle requires of States when there is a risk of environmental transboundary harm. While environmental law serves as a good comparison, it cannot guide us completely in what the content of the due diligence principle will be. \nIt is important to point out as well, that due diligence is not a static principle \u2013 it may ultimately evolve into something more demanding of States.255 As cyberspace develops, and regulation and State practice with it, it will become more clear what States are required to do. \n4.5.8Conclusion \nIt has been suggested that \u201cthe standard of due diligence [is] a useful yardstick by which to hold all States (to varying degrees) to a minimum standard of conduct\u201d and that this is especially true for new global challenges and new areas of transnational regulation.256 Cyberspace is undeniably included in this.\nIn conclusion, it need not be a concern that due diligence is an unreasonable burden for States. The obligation varies depending on the context and the level of development of the State. Due diligence must be seen in the light of the capabilities of the States \n254 Stockburger p. 248. \n255 ILA Study Group, Second Report p. 47. \n256 Ibid. \n52 \nconcerned and these capabilities will be taken into account when determining whether a State has breached the due diligence obligation or not. If a burden put on a State is deemed to be unreasonable, it will simply not be considered a breach of the due diligence obligation. \nFurthermore, the principle of due diligence is not a new concept. It is well established customary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the principle in relation to cyber operations.In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great addition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of Experts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be in line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule 6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field of cyberspace. \n4.6Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace \nWhile there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, some authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, Stockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence obligation.257 By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence principle to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle.258  He also argues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially affect the rights and interests of another State.259 At the same time, he states that this is not customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex ferenda.260 \n\tThe fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore considered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be used to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. \tDue diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. For example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International Health Regulations261imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within \n257 Stockburger p. 257. \n258 Ibid p. 260. \n259 Ibid p. 257. See also above in Chapter 4.5.7. \n260 Ibid p. 260. \n261 World Health Assembly, International Health Regulations. Geneva, World Health Organization (2005). \n53 \n[their territories]\u201d. This sort of system could be used in the cyber context, which would be more of an obligation to prevent rather than repress. However, at this point in time, there is rather wide skepticism against pure preventive measures. Although the obligation itself would not pose a huge burden on States, the possibility of States agreeing on these types of obligations seems unlikely at the moment, considering for example that it was not too long ago that certain States for the first time acknowledged that international law applies to cyberspace. Expanding the scope of due diligence in cyberspace is rather a question for the future. \n54 \n5Countermeasures \n5.1Countermeasures in cyberspace \nAs explained in Chapter 3.5, countermeasures are a way for injured States to induce a State responsible for an internationally wrongful act to comply with its legal obligations. The use of countermeasures in response to a cyber operation has been regulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. \nRule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 lays out the general principle of countermeasures in cyberspace.262 It holds that a State may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal obligation that it is owed by another State. Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a responsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule 22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.263 According to Rule 23, countermeasures must be proportionate to the injury to which they respond.264 The regulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 greatly follows the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the case law of the ICJ. \nAlthough some difficulties, which arise with attribution and countermeasures, are avoided when applying the due diligence principle instead, the use of countermeasures is not completely uncomplicated in relation to due diligence. The injured State still needs to prove, with clear and convincing evidence, that the attack originated from the territory of the territorial State, and that the State in question failed its due diligence obligation. Granted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation emanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack. However, it is still not a simple task. For example, it also needs to be ascertained whether the territorial State had knowledge of the harmful cyber operation or not. It is necessary to trace back the malicious data to establish the territorial link to the State \u201cto a convincing degree\u201d.265 The risk of incorrectly identifying the source of the cyber operations is relatively high.266\n262 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 111. 263 Ibid p. 116 and 122. \n264 Ibid p. 127. \n265 Geiss & Lahmann p. 637. \n266 Ibid. \n55 \n5.2The scope of countermeasures in cyberspace \nThe Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project case conditions still apply and are reflected in the Tallinn Manual 2.0. It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the countermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justifiedin a due diligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in State A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this case, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to control the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control its territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.269 \n\tNot fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful omission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking countermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. The countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the severity and consequences of the cyber operations.270 \n\tThis way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the international context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take measures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in relation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that fact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due diligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, since that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself. \n\tAs has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can be either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. \tIt is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of countermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, in the field of cyberspace.271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by. In its declaration in 2019, France stated that the consequences of a violation of the due diligence obligation may be political or diplomatic action, for example, the use of \n267 Schmitt, In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace p. 77. \n268 Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations p. 113. 269 Ibid. \n270 Ibid p. 130. \n271 NATO CCD COE, Trends in international law for cyberspace (May 2019) at 2(b). \n56 \ncountermeasures.272 At the same time, France made it clear that only non-forcible countermeasures are allowed and that the failure of a State to fulfill the due diligence obligation does not justify an exception from the prohibition of the use of force.273 It is yet to be seen what other States believe to the be the law of countermeasures in cyberspace. \n272 Roguski. \n273 Roguski. \n57 \n58 \n6Conclusion \n6.1Some summarizing comments about due diligence in cyberspace The purpose of this study was to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this. \nIt has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the same way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber operations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the anonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations to States. \nDue diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having to be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have a responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international activities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be used also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor. \nThe main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered applicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a status as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, doctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, which has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all areas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general principle of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace.That is the thesis of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, or at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not apply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies. States may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but neither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due diligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the statements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about \n59 \nState practice or opinio juris. As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent in order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to be positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more reluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence obligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to cyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. \tFurthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the principle is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber operations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has been stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. Additionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only slightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the malicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, must affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the State. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could not agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due diligence principle, but there are still problems to solve. \nFurther regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of the principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber operations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of international law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of the due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between different interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the problem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary with a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations.\n6.2As we look to the future\u2026 \nThe UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by \n60 \nStates, and to submit a report on the results of the study.274 The new UN GGE already had a substantive session on 9-13 December 2019 and released a collated summaries of their regional consultations.275 From the summary, it can be noted that some States suggested that due diligence should be brought up and looked into, particularly \u201cwhere actions within one State\u2019s territory affect the rights of other States\u201d.276 Furthermore, the UN GGE provided that the Tallinn Manual 2.0 offered an academic perspective on the applicability of international law, but that more work was needed in this field.277 The UN GGE is due to submit its final report to the General Assembly in 2021.278 \n\tThe UN General Assembly also decided to convene an open-ended working group with the applicability of international law on its agenda.279 The working group convened for the first time in 2019 and operates on a consensus basis.280 Due diligence in cyberspace is a current issue and the trend is indeed that it is being more and more included in the work of the UN and that States are starting to express their views on the obligation. Hopefully, by these initiatives, States will be able to further clarify their views on the due diligence principle in cyberspace.\n274 A/RES/73/266, Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (22 December 2018) p. 3 para. 3. \n275 United Nations, Regional Consultations series of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (9-13 December 2019). 276 Ibid p. 8.\n277 Ibid p. 7. \n278 A/RES/73/266 p. 3 para. 3. \n279 A/RES/73/27, Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (5 December 2018) para. 5. \n280 Ibid. \n61 \n62 \nSources \nBibliography \nArias, G.J., Are the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks?, Revista Tribuna Internacional, Volume 6, Issue 11 (2017). \nBanks, W, State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions After Tallinn 2.0., Texas Law Review, Volume 95, Issue 7 (June, 2017) pp. 1487-1514. \nBannelier-Christakis, K, Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?, Baltic Yearbook of International Law, Vol. 14 (2014). \nBarlow, J, A Declaration of Iessed 24 November 2019.

The abilities of the perpetrators to cause destruction of both material and non-material assets \nand even injury and death to individuals through cyberspace have challenged traditional definitions of the use of force. The \npresent study aims to investigate approaches to answering novel questions encountered by jurists attempting to deliberate \non such matters. Answers to these questions should be reached within existent legal frameworks or codified within a novel \nlegal framework. This study poses the question as to whether these attacks are covered by the prohibitions stipulated in \nArticle 2(4) of the UN charter. It concludes that due to the novelty of the phenomenon, existing legislation inadequately \nregulates the use of cyberspace for hostile acts. Preliminary efforts such as codification of the Tallinn Manual by NATO have \nnot produced the desired legal outcomes. Thus, the general principles and rules of international humanitarian law should be \nutilized for regulating hostile relations in cyberspace. As stated by Marten Condition a century ago, the absence of special \nregulations should not bar the enforcement of general regulations and the application of principles, common rules and \nduties. Governments require recognition of their right to defend vital infrastructure. Assuming an attacked state can identify \nthe source of a cyberattack and attribute it to another government, response options include referring the matter to the UN \nSecurity Council or the International Court of Justice or undertaking retaliatory cyberinterventions or instituting armed \nreactions, assuming the principle of proportionality is observed. \nKeywords: Cyberattacks, use of force, humanitarian laws, Tallinn Manual \n1. Introduction:\nIn 2009, a military international organization based in Tallinn, Estonia, known as the Supreme Cyber Defense \nCooperation Center and instantiated by NATO, invited an international group of independent experts to author \na set of guidelines for the creation of a law that could govern cyber-defense. The project, which was carried out \nby experts and international law researchers, sought to generalize legal and regulatory norms in modern \nwarfare. International law guidelines regarding cyberwar stem from an expert-oriented process which created \na non-binding document to expand cyberlaw and clarify existing documents about cyber-interventions and cyber \nhostilities.  \nThe Tallinn manual can serve as an example of cooperative international law-making for the cyber-sphere, but \ndue to its non-binding nature, it is inadequate as a basis for the current analysis. This discussion references other \ninternational documents and studies to more fully explore the creation and interpretation of existing \ninternational cyberlaw and justify interventions such as binding prohibitions and force. The prohibition of force \nis referred to in Paragraph 4 of Article 2 of the UN Charter, which states that \u201c\u2026all members should avoid \nthreatening or applying force in their international relationships against the territorial integrity or the political \nindependence of any country or any other method that is in contradiction to the United Nations\u2019 intentions\u201d. \nThe prohibition is binding on members and non-members since these Articles express common rights. The only \nexception in the charter pertains to legitimate individual or collective defense.  \nA close examination of Paragraph 4 of Article 2 prompts the following questions: \nx\nWhat does the concept of \u201cforce\u201d, as used in Article 2(4), connote exactly?\nx\nAre economic or political embargoes considered \u201cforce\u201d?\nx\nCan \u201ccyber force or power\u201d be construed as force for the purpose of this provision?\n451\n"}], "max_tokens": 2048}}

Two critical incidents had previously triggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form armed attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. The second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year. Furthermore, on June 21, 2016, the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world.\nThe previous incidents have created, once again, public questioning if the rules on the use of force and the right of self-defense established in the United Nations Charter are sufficient and efficient to address these new forms of attacks. \nKey words: Self-defense, United Nations, Pre-emptive Self-defense, non-state actors, cyber-attacks \nResumen: Los \u00faltimos ataques de la coalici\u00f3n liderada por Estados Unidos en contra de ISIS en Siria plantearon la cuesti\u00f3n de si los Estados pueden usar la autodefensa contra agentes-no-estatales.

About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about self-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present essay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the use of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address conflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense as the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the consideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in development since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy physical assets. \n2.The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \tNations Charter \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which is the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the second term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is allowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n2/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThe general prohibition of the use of force is a treaty-based rule established in the United Nations Charter (from now on \"UNCH\") and a rule of customary law that has evolved particularly in recent years.2 It is a treaty-based rule because it is recognized in the United Nations Charter, but at the same time is accepted as being representative of customary international law in the terms expressed by the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) in the Nicaragua case.3\nArticle 2(4) of the UNCH express that members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations (UN). The article reflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international relations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political independence of any State. \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and second, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) in both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 The pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the interpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the laying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by United States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in forcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army and training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5 \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, then refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6\nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use of force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 settled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is expressly prohibited.7\nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the prohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \tEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

Gonzalo J. Arias \npurposes of the UNCH. The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the Charter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, what needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned purposes. \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is necessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented interpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United Nations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna Convention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in Articles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith by the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose. \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously explained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: that is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the scope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the extent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in pursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore democratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view has not been considered by states. \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat and use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the text, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should remain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases. \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the general rule of prohibition of the use of force. \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \t813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. 10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n4/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n3.The right to self-defense \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11 \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article 51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right to respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based on the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to self-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, unlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception to the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad interpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be explained in the following section. \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense is part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and proportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such as the Nicaragua case.14The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it expressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized that a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside Article 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning both sources.15 \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a construction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed attack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Gonzalo J. Arias \nthe concept extends beyond attacks by regular forces, also covering attacks by armed bands, irregulars, and mercenaries.17 It is responsible for saying that this interpretation seems to be accurate because it can cover not only attacks from one state to another but also armed attacks from militant groups from one state to another state, armed attacks within the boundaries of a state. Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from the attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised regarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any international rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion will be addressed in the next section. \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it is unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of the right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary international law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the primary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being committed or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will be developed in the next segment of this essay. \n4.Anticipatory self-defense \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a wider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the scope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under Article 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19 \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does recognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN General Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. 18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. 19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n6/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nFollowing Professor Van den hole, the question has a straightforward answer: yes, and the grounds for the development can be found in the Caroline case.20\nThe Caroline case was an incident occurred in the first part of the nineteenth century when the anti-British insurrection was taking place in Canada. At the time, Canada was under British control while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state of peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the rebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara River, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship on fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-defense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British government ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-defense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21\nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity and proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of general rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory self-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor moment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal analysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, that is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being launched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its application are fulfilled. \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Israel have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the doctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23\nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. Furthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack or it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when any further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or avert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this analysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25\n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \t1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \t2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n7/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat of the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided information regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to self-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, on the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has also presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-defense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was the cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent and not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a state can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important to remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to the attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to self-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory self-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states. \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been traditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not difficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, the 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last decade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. Since the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have raised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions have created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the United Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter and rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state actors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions of the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address that the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to address current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, whether they come from state or non-state actors. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n8/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n5.The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \tto a pre-emptive self-defense? \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and explained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of conflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place in April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used force to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery of a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant incident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28 \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state actors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold of an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition of armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary international law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated to satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new considerations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting extreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals trained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist organisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that within a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29\nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new considerations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the considerations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n26  C.

Gonzalo J. Arias \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive self-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international authorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational or directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-state as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 One can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-emptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be launched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by the United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in the United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new threats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal creation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been internationally agreed, yet. \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the right to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. On the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of those two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state might consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible attack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim the right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive interpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong,Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was international law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there a need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of international law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current discussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is highly complex and debatable. \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the international scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-defense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory self-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere possibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, the self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the nature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist become less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and speculative.34\nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-defense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions governing self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual attack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that even when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still demands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, besides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect on the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity to adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks. \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense and customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect and prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for new mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A reflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the US government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack to respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a UN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36\nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the use of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed attacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be developed in the final section. \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. 35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t11/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \n6.Why are the rules of the use of force outdated? The case of US-led \tcoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the right to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s interpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international law, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new international actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the existing rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible for saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the right to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for attacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks. \n1.1 \tThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors)\nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and states have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and in the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit the Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and updated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to ISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi. \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried out by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for the first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. 38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \tGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t12/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nand launch attacks to their own-state-territory and other states claiming their international recognition. \nMonica Hakimi has explained that the US-led coalition attacks against ISIL in Syria have again raised the question whether states can use defensive force (right to self-defense) against non-state actors.40 This reflects a need for modern interpretation of the rules to be useful in the regulation of the use of force and self-defense from non-state actors.  However, the proper analysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the thesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that were plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of self-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in consequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three main issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-state actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a position on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules that are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42\nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to acknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s arguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said the vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could trigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his interpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage in self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language of the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its borders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, the context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state actors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace. \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are restricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security Council. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include the right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an armed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3. \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \tof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238. \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t13/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nforce in response to a significant armed attack by a non-state actor outside the context of war should be unlawful. 45\nIn other words, she has concluded that attacks from non-state actors cannot be considered to be under the scope of the exception of Article 51 of the Charter unless they can be categorised as to be in the context of war. However, this position seems to have little recognition among international lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military grounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of peaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a substantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-state actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor performed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that this fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state actor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot exercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent attack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by all means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is no provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory self-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open a door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional provisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. However, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their interpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, Paust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the Charter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n1.2 \tCyber-attacks\n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. Thus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists in the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose regulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what it stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the Internet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have access to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46 \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254.\n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t14/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThere are two critical incidents that triggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form of attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the websites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers even disabled the parliamentary email server.47 \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been far more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, power grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, and social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the Tallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in attacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia.50\nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control adversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and decision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a cyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and control by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51\nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial institutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in the same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an armed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state is that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary international law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs to be addressed. \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \tSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.\n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188.\n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \tExcellence, NATO, 2008). \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \tJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t15/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s research. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang says, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules on state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is the core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; however, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the rules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this understanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most complex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of the rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In consequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance agreed understanding as to its governing legal regime. \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules are outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what rules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of the use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary international standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not difficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks were not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of self-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for attacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of a possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential provisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-established customary rules of international law.54\nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide information and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are outdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, even when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in depth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law Commission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \tApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44. \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013). 54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\tthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001). \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t16/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nthe other, the rules contained in the Tallinn Manual, especially Article 5 of control of cyber-infrastructure, are also applicable.56 \nThe ARSIWA provisions had established a set of rules for the determination of the attribution of conduct to a State. In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State unless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for particular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other movements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be considered an act of that State under international law.57\nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective to determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task because these operations have unique particularities..For example, hackers can easily hide their identity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, most of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals rather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single actor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59\nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine the attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and the right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60\nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the traditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with the complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA Articles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure of cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new updates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA rules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to solve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have indeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As it was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining responsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations need to be developed to reduce the gap. \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their territory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect for the sovereignty of other States. \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on who the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the attacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary international rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to address this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules for a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right to self-defense. \n7.Conclusion\nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. This is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced the necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks. \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those traditionally used. This has led to creating rules for attribution, to determine international \n61  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 51. \n62  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, 26. \n63  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d, 26. \n64  Hidayat Setiaji, \u201cIndonesia, South Korea Central Bank Websites Hit by Cyber Attacks.

About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about self-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present essay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the use of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address conflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense as the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the consideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in development since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy physical assets. \n2.The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \tNations Charter \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which is the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the second term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is allowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n2/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThe general prohibition of the use of force is a treaty-based rule established in the United Nations Charter (from now on \"UNCH\") and a rule of customary law that has evolved particularly in recent years.2 It is a treaty-based rule because it is recognized in the United Nations Charter, but at the same time is accepted as being representative of customary international law in the terms expressed by the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) in the Nicaragua case.3\nArticle 2(4) of the UNCH express that members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations (UN). The article reflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international relations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political independence of any State. \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and second, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) in both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 The pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the interpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the laying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by United States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in forcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army and training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5 \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, then refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6\nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use of force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 settled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is expressly prohibited.7\nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the prohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \tEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

Gonzalo J. Arias \npurposes of the UNCH. The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the Charter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, what needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned purposes. \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is necessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented interpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United Nations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna Convention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in Articles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith by the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose. \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously explained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: that is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the scope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the extent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in pursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore democratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view has not been considered by states. \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat and use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the text, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should remain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases. \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the general rule of prohibition of the use of force. \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \t813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. 10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n4/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n3.The right to self-defense \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11 \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article 51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right to respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based on the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to self-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, unlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception to the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad interpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be explained in the following section. \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense is part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and proportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such as the Nicaragua case.14The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it expressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized that a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside Article 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning both sources.15 \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a construction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed attack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another.

Gonzalo J. Arias \nthe concept extends beyond attacks by regular forces, also covering attacks by armed bands, irregulars, and mercenaries.17 It is responsible for saying that this interpretation seems to be accurate because it can cover not only attacks from one state to another but also armed attacks from militant groups from one state to another state, armed attacks within the boundaries of a state. Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from the attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised regarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any international rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion will be addressed in the next section. \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it is unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of the right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary international law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the primary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being committed or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will be developed in the next segment of this essay. \n4.Anticipatory self-defense \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a wider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the scope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under Article 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19 \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does recognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN General Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. 18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. 19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n6/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nFollowing Professor Van den hole, the question has a straightforward answer: yes, and the grounds for the development can be found in the Caroline case.20\nThe Caroline case was an incident occurred in the first part of the nineteenth century when the anti-British insurrection was taking place in Canada. At the time, Canada was under British control while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state of peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the rebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara River, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship on fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-defense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British government ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-defense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21\nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity and proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of general rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory self-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor moment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal analysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, that is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being launched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its application are fulfilled. \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Israel have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the doctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23\nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. Furthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack or it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when any further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or avert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this analysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25\n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \t1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \t2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n7/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts?

Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, on the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has also presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-defense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was the cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent and not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a state can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important to remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to the attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to self-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory self-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states. \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been traditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not difficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, the 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last decade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. Since the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have raised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions have created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the United Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter and rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state actors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions of the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address that the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to address current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, whether they come from state or non-state actors. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n8/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n5.The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \tto a pre-emptive self-defense? \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and explained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of conflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place in April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used force to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery of a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant incident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28 \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state actors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold of an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition of armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary international law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated to satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new considerations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting extreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals trained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist organisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that within a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29\nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new considerations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the considerations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n26  C.

Gonzalo J. Arias \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive self-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international authorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational or directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-state as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 One can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-emptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be launched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by the United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in the United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new threats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal creation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been internationally agreed, yet. \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the right to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. On the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of those two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state might consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible attack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim the right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive interpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong,Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was international law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there a need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of international law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current discussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is highly complex and debatable. \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the international scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-defense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory self-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere possibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, the self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the nature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist become less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and speculative.34\nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-defense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions governing self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual attack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that even when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still demands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, besides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect on the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity to adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks. \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense and customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect and prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for new mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A reflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the US government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack to respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a UN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36\nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the use of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed attacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be developed in the final section. \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. 35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t11/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \n6.Why are the rules of the use of force outdated? The case of US-led \tcoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the right to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s interpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international law, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new international actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the existing rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible for saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the right to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for attacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks. \n1.1 \tThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors)\nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and states have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and in the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit the Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and updated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to ISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi. \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried out by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for the first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. 38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \tGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t12/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nand launch attacks to their own-state-territory and other states claiming their international recognition. \nMonica Hakimi has explained that the US-led coalition attacks against ISIL in Syria have again raised the question whether states can use defensive force (right to self-defense) against non-state actors.40 This reflects a need for modern interpretation of the rules to be useful in the regulation of the use of force and self-defense from non-state actors.  However, the proper analysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the thesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that were plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of self-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in consequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three main issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-state actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a position on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules that are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42\nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to acknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s arguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said the vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could trigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his interpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage in self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language of the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its borders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, the context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state actors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace. \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are restricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security Council. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include the right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an armed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3. \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \tof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238. \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t13/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nforce in response to a significant armed attack by a non-state actor outside the context of war should be unlawful. 45\nIn other words, she has concluded that attacks from non-state actors cannot be considered to be under the scope of the exception of Article 51 of the Charter unless they can be categorised as to be in the context of war. However, this position seems to have little recognition among international lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military grounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of peaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a substantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-state actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor performed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that this fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state actor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot exercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent attack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by all means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is no provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory self-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open a door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional provisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. However, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their interpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, Paust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the Charter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n1.2 \tCyber-attacks\n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. Thus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists in the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose regulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what it stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the Internet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have access to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46 \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254.\n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t14/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThere are two critical incidents that triggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form of attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the websites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers even disabled the parliamentary email server.47 \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been far more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, power grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, and social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the Tallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in attacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia.50\nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control adversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and decision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a cyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and control by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51\nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial institutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in the same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an armed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state is that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary international law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs to be addressed. \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \tSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.\n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188.\n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \tExcellence, NATO, 2008). \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \tJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t15/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s research. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang says, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules on state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is the core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; however, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the rules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this understanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most complex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of the rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In consequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance agreed understanding as to its governing legal regime. \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules are outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what rules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of the use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary international standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not difficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks were not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of self-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for attacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of a possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential provisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-established customary rules of international law.54\nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide information and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are outdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, even when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in depth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law Commission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \tApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44. \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013). 54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\tthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001). \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t16/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nthe other, the rules contained in the Tallinn Manual, especially Article 5 of control of cyber-infrastructure, are also applicable.56 \nThe ARSIWA provisions had established a set of rules for the determination of the attribution of conduct to a State. In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State unless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for particular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other movements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be considered an act of that State under international law.57\nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective to determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task because these operations have unique particularities..For example, hackers can easily hide their identity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, most of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals rather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single actor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59\nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine the attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and the right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60\nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the traditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with the complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA Articles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure of cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new updates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA rules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to solve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have indeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As it was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining responsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations need to be developed to reduce the gap. \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their territory.

The second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year.

About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about self-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present essay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the use of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address conflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense as the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the consideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in development since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy physical assets. \n2.The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United \tNations Charter \nIn this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which is the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the second term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is allowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n2/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThe general prohibition of the use of force is a treaty-based rule established in the United Nations Charter (from now on \"UNCH\") and a rule of customary law that has evolved particularly in recent years.2 It is a treaty-based rule because it is recognized in the United Nations Charter, but at the same time is accepted as being representative of customary international law in the terms expressed by the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) in the Nicaragua case.3\nArticle 2(4) of the UNCH express that members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations (UN). The article reflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international relations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political independence of any State. \nFurthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and second, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) in both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal.4 The pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the interpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the laying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by United States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in forcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army and training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.5 \nOn the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, then refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force.6\nUntil 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use of force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 settled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is expressly prohibited.7\nIn the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the prohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the \n2  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, The \tEuropean Journal of International Law 16, n\u00b0 5 (2006): 803. \n3  Christine Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, in International Law, 4th Ed., ed.

Gonzalo J. Arias \npurposes of the UNCH. The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the Charter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, what needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned purposes. \nAn absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is necessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented interpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.8 Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United Nations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna Convention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in Articles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith by the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose. \nIn other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously explained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: that is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition. \nOn the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the scope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the extent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in pursuit of democracy.9  There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore democratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter.10 However, this view has not been considered by states. \nThe conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat and use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the text, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should remain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases. \nThe following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the general rule of prohibition of the use of force. \n8  Olivier Corten, \u201cThe Controversies Over the Customary Prohibition on the Use of Force: A Methodological Debate\u201d, \t813. \n9  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. 10  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 623. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n4/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n3.The right to self-defense \nThe main exception to the prohibition of the use of force is established in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.11 \nThe scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article 51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right to respond to an armed attack.12 A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based on the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to self-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, unlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception to the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad interpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be explained in the following section. \nThe scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense is part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and proportionated.13 The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such as the Nicaragua case.14The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it expressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized that a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside Article 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning both sources.15 \nFurthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a construction of customary international law.16 The definition traditionally recognizes as armed attack the one performed by a regular army of one state to the territory of another. Nevertheless, \n11  United Nations, \u201cCharter of the United Nations.\" \n12  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628. \n13  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628. \n14  Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. the United States of America), \t1981 I.C.J., 14 ICJ Reports 1986 (International Court of Justice 1986). \n15  Andrew Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, Queensland University of Technology \tLaw & Justice Journal 4, n\u00b0 2 (2004): 3. \n16  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 628.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n5/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nthe concept extends beyond attacks by regular forces, also covering attacks by armed bands, irregulars, and mercenaries.17 It is responsible for saying that this interpretation seems to be accurate because it can cover not only attacks from one state to another but also armed attacks from militant groups from one state to another state, armed attacks within the boundaries of a state. Other interpretation would probably be restrictive. \nIt is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from the attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised regarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any international rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion will be addressed in the next section. \nTo summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it is unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of the right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary international law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the primary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being committed or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will be developed in the next segment of this essay. \n4.Anticipatory self-defense \nIn this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a wider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the scope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under Article 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19 \nThe source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does recognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN General Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it? \n17  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 629. 18  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. 19  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n6/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nFollowing Professor Van den hole, the question has a straightforward answer: yes, and the grounds for the development can be found in the Caroline case.20\nThe Caroline case was an incident occurred in the first part of the nineteenth century when the anti-British insurrection was taking place in Canada. At the time, Canada was under British control while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state of peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the rebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara River, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship on fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-defense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British government ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-defense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.21\nProfessor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity and proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of general rule of customary international law.22 The conditions for the application of anticipatory self-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor moment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal analysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, that is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being launched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its application are fulfilled. \nIt is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Israel have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed. However, the doctrine is highly controversial that the right has rarely been practiced.23\nAs it was explained, this is a controversial issue and remains contested by different states. Furthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack or it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when any further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or avert the attack against it.24 Finally, as a reflect of the controversy, the ICJ deliberately left this analysis unresolved in the Nicaragua case and the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo.25\n20  Leo Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, American University International Law Review 19, n\u00b0 \t1 (2003): 95. \n21  Anthony Clark Arend, \u201cInternational Law and Pre-emptive Use of Military Force\u201d, The Washington Quarterly 26, n\u00b0 2 (Spring \t2003): 90. \n22  Van den hole, \u201cAnticipatory Self-Defence under International Law\u201d, 97. \n23  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630. \n24  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 631. \n25  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 630.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n7/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nUp to this point, this essay has explained the regulation of the provision for the use or the threat of the use of force under the United Nations Charter. Furthermore, it has also provided information regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to self-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, on the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has also presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-defense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was the cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent and not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a state can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important to remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to the attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to self-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. \nAs it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory self-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states. \nThe exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been traditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not difficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, the 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last decade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. Since the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have raised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions have created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the United Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter and rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state actors attacks? \nThe next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions of the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address that the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to address current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, whether they come from state or non-state actors. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n8/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \n5.The impact of 9/11 terrorist attacks on the right to self-defense. A right \tto a pre-emptive self-defense? \nThe facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and explained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. \nAttacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of conflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place in April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub.26 The third incident was when the United States used force to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery of a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait.27 The final significant incident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.28 \nIt is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state actors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold of an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition of armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary international law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated to satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new considerations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors. \nA new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting extreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals trained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist organisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that within a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.29\nThe attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new considerations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks. One of the considerations was the creation of the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. \n26  C.

Gonzalo J. Arias \nProfessors Reisman and Armstrong have provided a definition of this doctrine. Pre-emptive self-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international authorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational or directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-state as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself.30 One can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-emptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be launched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. \nThe discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by the United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in the United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new threats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal creation31. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been internationally agreed, yet. \nFollowing the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the right to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. On the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of those two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state might consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible attack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim the right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive interpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. \nFollowing Reisman and Armstrong,Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was international law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there a need for new responses?.32 He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of international law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks.33 In other words, the current discussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is \n30  W.

This problem is not of an easy solution; on the contrary, it is highly complex and debatable. \nReisman and Armstrong have further explained that attacks like 9/11 have moved the international scenario from an actual armed attack as the requisite threshold of reactive self-defense to the palpable and imminent threat of attack, which is the threshold of anticipatory self-defense. The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere possibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, the self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the nature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist become less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and speculative.34\nProfessor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-defense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions governing self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual attack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality.35 This means that even when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still demands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, besides this, the issue remains controversial. \nThe arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect on the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity to adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks. \nFrom the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense and customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect and prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for new mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A reflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the US government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack to respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a UN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.36\nThis reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the use of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed attacks. Second to the consideration of attacks from non-state actors, both issues will be developed in the final section. \n34  Reisman and Armstrong, \u201cThe Past and Future of the Claim of Pre-emptive Self-Defence\u201d, 527. 35  Garwood-Gowers, \u201cSelf-Defence against Terrorism in the Post-9/11 World\u201d, 14. \n36  Gray, \u201cThe Use of Force and the International Legal Order\u201d, 634.\nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t11/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \n6.Why are the rules of the use of force outdated? The case of US-led \tcoalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks \nFrom the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the right to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u00b4s interpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international law, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new international actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the existing rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible for saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the right to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static.37 The definition for attacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks. \n1.1 \tThe case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors)\nThe United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and states have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and in the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit the Charter regime.38 Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and updated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to ISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi. \nAs a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried out by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.39 The particular characteristics of ISIS\u00b4s attacks can be found in the fact that for the first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe \n37  Christian Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, The European Journal of International Law 20, n\u00b0 2 (2009): 360. 38  Tams, \u201cThe Use of Force against Terrorists\u201d, 360. \n39  Federica D\u2019Alessandra, \u201cJus and Bellum in Syria: The Meaning of the US Airpower Campaign\u201d, Human Rights Law Working \tGroup Newsletter (March 2015): 37. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t12/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nand launch attacks to their own-state-territory and other states claiming their international recognition. \nMonica Hakimi has explained that the US-led coalition attacks against ISIL in Syria have again raised the question whether states can use defensive force (right to self-defense) against non-state actors.40 This reflects a need for modern interpretation of the rules to be useful in the regulation of the use of force and self-defense from non-state actors.  However, the proper analysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested.41 However, the thesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that were plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of self-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in consequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked. \nHakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three main issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-state actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a position on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules that are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.42\nProfessor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to acknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s arguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said the vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could trigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH.43 The grounds for his interpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage in self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language of the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its borders, he argues.44 Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, the context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state actors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace. \nOn the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are restricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security Council. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include the right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an armed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military \n40  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors: The State of Play\u201d, International Law Studies 91 (2015) 3. \n41  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 3 42  Monica Hakimi, \u201cDefensive Force against Non-State Actors\u201d, 4. \n43  Jordan Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors and Permissibility of U.S. Use of Drones in Pakistan\", Journal \tof Transnational Law and Policy 19, n\u00b0 2 (2010): 238. \n44  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 239. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t13/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nforce in response to a significant armed attack by a non-state actor outside the context of war should be unlawful. 45\nIn other words, she has concluded that attacks from non-state actors cannot be considered to be under the scope of the exception of Article 51 of the Charter unless they can be categorised as to be in the context of war. However, this position seems to have little recognition among international lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military grounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of peaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a substantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-state actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor performed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that this fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state actor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot exercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent attack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by all means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is no provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory self-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open a door that could never be closed. \nThe conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional provisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. However, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their interpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, Paust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the Charter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts. \n1.2 \tCyber-attacks\n\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. Thus, it is not a new term in international law. For several decades, international law\u2019s specialists in the use of force have dedicated efforts towards understanding this problem and propose regulations. However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what it stands for to a top position on their agendas. The key issue is how to achieve security on the Internet by governments, organisations, and commercial interests when people want to have access to the Internet and all that it offers but not to be harmed by it.46 \n45  Paust, \u201cSelf-Defence Targetings of Non-State Actors\u201d, 254.\n46  Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, Journal of Conflicts and Security Law 17, n\u00b0 2 (2012): 187. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t14/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nThere are two critical incidents that triggered the discussion on the importance and consequences of cyber-attacks as a new form of attacks. The first one occurred in Estonia in 2007, when the country experienced extensive computer hacking attacks that lasted several weeks. Cyber-attacks were launched targeting the country's infrastructure shutting down the websites of all government ministries, two major banks, and several political parties; hackers even disabled the parliamentary email server.47 \nWhile the cyber-attacks on Estonia shocked the international community, they could have been far more devastating. In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, power grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, and social unrest.48 Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the Tallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs. \nThe second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year.49 The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in attacks against Estonia in 2007. Among them were the National Bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia.50\nAs Professors Martin Stytz and Shelia Banks have explained, cyber-attacks can be used to control adversary\u00b4s information, target the portions of cyberspace used for situational awareness and decision-making, as well as lead the opponent to perform unwanted conducts. Furthermore, a cyber-attack diminishes both individual and collective situational awareness, command and control by undermining one or more elements of cyberspace.51\nThe question one should ask is if a cyber-attack launched to a State\u00b4s banks or financial institutions or energy supply facilities or military assets, can be considered an armed attack under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter? Can the impact of that cyber-attacks be measured in the same way of a traditional armed attack? Should the economic impacts be considered an armed attack? The importance of this new form of attacks from individuals or groups to a state is that they don't fit in the definition of armed attacks constructed by the rules of customary international law. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to acknowledge they are a reality that needs to be addressed. \n47  Steven Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses\u201d, Journal of Strategic \tSecurity 4, n\u00b0 2 (2011): 51.\n48  Herzog, \u201cRevisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks, 2. \n49  O\u2019Connell, \u201cCyber Security without Cyber War\u201d, 188.\n50  \u201cCyber Attacks Against Georgia: Legal Lessons Identified\u201d (Tallinn, Estonia: Cooperative Cyber Defence Center for \tExcellence, NATO, 2008). \n51  Martin Stytz and Sheila Banks, \"Cyber Warfare Simulation to Prepare to Control CyberSpace\", National Cybersecurity Institute \tJournal 1, n\u00b0 2 (2014): 9. \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar \n\t15/19 \nAre the rules for the right to self-defense outdated to address current conflicts? Gonzalo J. Arias \nTo understand the previous doubts, it is important to highlight Professor Zhxiong Huang\u00b4s research. He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang says, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules on state attribution can be applied to these activities.52 In other words, what Huang presents is the core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; however, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the rules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this understanding. \nTo reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most complex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of the rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception.53 In consequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance agreed understanding as to its governing legal regime. \nFrom the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules are outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what rules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of the use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary international standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not difficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks were not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of self-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for attacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of a possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential provisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-established customary rules of international law.54\nBefore continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide information and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are outdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks. In consequence, even when the sets of regulations are presented to provide answers, they will not be dealt in depth because it will exceed the purpose of this paper. \nAs it was announced, there are two main sets of rules. On the one hand, the International Law Commission\u2019s work on state responsibility, also known as the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), are adequate to address this problem.55 On \n52  Zixiong Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: A Preliminary Assessment of Their \tApplication to Cyber-Operations\u201d, Baltic Yearbook of International Law Online 14, n\u00b0 1 (2014): 44. \n53  Michael Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d (Cambridge: CUP, 2013). 54  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n55  \u201cArticles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-\tthird Session (International Law Commission, 2001). \nN\u00famero de p\u00e1gina no utilizable para citar\n\t16/19 \nRevista Tribuna Internacional \nVolumen 6 \u2022 N\u00b0 11 \u2022 2017 \nISSN 0719-482X (Versi\u00f3n en l\u00ednea) \nthe other, the rules contained in the Tallinn Manual, especially Article 5 of control of cyber-infrastructure, are also applicable.56 \nThe ARSIWA provisions had established a set of rules for the determination of the attribution of conduct to a State. In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State unless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for particular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other movements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be considered an act of that State under international law.57\nThe previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective to determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task because these operations have unique particularities..For example, hackers can easily hide their identity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, most of them come from individuals.58 Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals rather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single actor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.59\nHuang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine the attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and the right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.60\nThe importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the traditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with the complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA Articles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure of cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new updates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA rules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to solve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have indeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As it was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining responsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations need to be developed to reduce the gap. \nThe international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the \n56  Schmitt, \u201cTallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\u201d. \n57  Huang, \u201cThe Attribution Rules in the ILC\u2019s\u201d, 45. \n58  D.

First, to any infrastructure, whether is governmental or not, located on their territory. Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control.63 This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect for the sovereignty of other States. \nFinally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on who the hackers were.64 According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the attacks. \nThis latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary international rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to address this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules for a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right to self-defense. \n7.Conclusion\nAs it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. This is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced the necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks. \nAs it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those traditionally used.

Computer systems are often not the end target of attackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. Attacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer networks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer network systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have codes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as effective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. Cyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic armed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the identification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, and how much damage they wreak using malware. Cyber Warfare is a fight between two \nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nnations, not between individuals. Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual hacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and engaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. Hackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal status of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that may handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, unorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has created a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law to investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how International Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the Tallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's capital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique the existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique has been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority for the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its enforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical analysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber Warfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is qualitative.\n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be used for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while secondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, books, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated under IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether a cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules apply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will take time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military operation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-physical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL often called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between civilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence its principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL doesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed cyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN Charter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute its tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways of war, it must be understood and react to these issues. Technology has created a new \n1077\nbattleground. IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. Conflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. Cyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and combatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, numerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're illegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of the IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL doesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. This study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one of the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to prohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child soldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts during wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new protocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children under 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting parties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. Additional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must investigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit convention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons beforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI might entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This could be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer Robots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. IHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely to employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about weaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). The following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant on IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and computer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military operations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and development, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, and energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone governments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' infrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most scholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n1078\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \ndemands an international legal reaction. The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated under international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers and advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't decided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. After describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare incidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of difference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to participate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. Many cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely to have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and methods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to encourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on how to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined above. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies may concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or kinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015)Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never happened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in the future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we can say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International Law. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than the kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and hacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because damages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international peace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with aim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy embedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011)As for instance, disrupting electricity grids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do not inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by the state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace (Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The reputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less as well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber Warfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the Hundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second World Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare would not take that long if it happens in the future. \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred framework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear weapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear war) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework to cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n1079\ndates back to the 1920s/30s. deterrence theory get more prominent and developed to its present form in times of the Cold War, between the US and Soviet Union. The US Army analyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and any other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a series of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick retaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution requires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must thus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human beings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the rise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a weapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending competition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the defensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form of threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has brought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence theory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first recognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The difficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber Warfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a need for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is now considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency on the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with great power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure rotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely guided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like space mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle beams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical assets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate them. \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its military is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and communication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. Not only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it also extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new kind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology are now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using viruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending on anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted in International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are already ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively target those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more expansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an imagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n1080\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nJust War Theory \nJust war theory has developed many centuries into its present form, the justification of war is evident from the defensive response from states or the United States Security authorization. The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to maintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways to justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some scholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that wrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive and preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These concepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and may be modified in the future Just War Theory. \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government militaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for actors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national infrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the digital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other use of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not different. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some scholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering morality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties and Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra damages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International Humanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent few years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied to cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare. \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the results of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And this permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as Cyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still needed to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this applicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International Community in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber Warfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is not addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation in the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber Warfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary apparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has also changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the Geneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application a little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal political recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of IAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against each other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international organization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n1081\nThe definition of International Armed Conflict has been provided in Common Article 2 (1) to the four Geneva Conventions, which brings about the application of International Humanitarian Law. However, the rules that are applicable to No-international armed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, without giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict. \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at the international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. The matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of conventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at an international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts at the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times. Conflicts occur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed conflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable to the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the state party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but involves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-international Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both the State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. Recognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the insurgent group; \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. non-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and military forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups. Hostilities must reach a particular level of severity and the parties engaged must be well-organized in order to be classified as an international armed conflict. NIACs, as defined in common Article 3 and NIACs as described in Article 1 of Additional Protocol II, are distinguished under IHL treaty law. \n\uf0d8Common Article 3 relates to non-international armed conflicts that occur on the territory of a high contracting party. Armed conflicts in which one or more established non-State armed organizations which involved and classified as these. NIACs between state armed forces and organized non-state organizations may occur or may occur only between such groups. \n\uf0d8It establishes the necessary territorial control, enabling organized non-state armed organizations to use that territorial control and are capable to carry out a prepared and powerful armed attack in order to implement the Protocol. \n\uf0d8The armed conflicts which happen between two or more independent nations with military forces and other organized armed groups Additional protocol II directly \n1082\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \napplies to such kinds of conflicts, unlike common Article 3 of Additional Protocol II does not apply to armed conflict of Non-state organized armed groups. \nIt is important to remember that the Additional Protocol II helps to improve and supplements common Article 3 without adjusting its current form of application, which means that this definition applies only to the validity of the Additional Protocol II, it does not apply to non-international armed conflicts. \nRichard Baxter has written about the Vietnam War, he stated that though He added that, although it is easy to demonstrate that the US participation in the war has internationalized the conflict under Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions (1949), the entire law of war may be applicable. The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\t\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of Nicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by the law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed by the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context of pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the idea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International Humanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such operations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always been one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its rules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The context in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules and principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber operations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability completely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a doubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown below. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection between the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In another way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not govern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the scope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under IHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold relationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into consideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. A cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed conflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international character and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, Partsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any other armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting parties does not consider the situation to be a war. Article 1 of Additional Protocol II of \n1083\n1977, on the other side, says that the protocol may be applied to all forms of armed conflicts involving military forces of a High Contracting Party and rebel armed groups or other organized armed groups that happen on the land of the High Contracting Party.IHL applies to both kinds of situations of international and non-international armed conflicts, as these two articles make clear (Droege, 2012). \nThere are two kinds of armed conflicts mentioned earlier, \n1.Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating colonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict between two or more states. \n2.non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or if it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber operations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are governed by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or in addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack on the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks and cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-attack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state employees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event of an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to interrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet the basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power grids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil pipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all are heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and operation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency between civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian objects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \n\tPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian population are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and suffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to the principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military necessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and are not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed conflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities (Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, necessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is based on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance the expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n1084\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nobjects. If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the equation, military necessity is the other. \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is necessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not otherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not withdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, and may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they are or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more restrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always employing restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions may be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is essential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's military foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its primary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of military advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor of the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is best described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of military force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of IHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons who are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to safeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured civilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. Petersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the enemy state by attacking only its military forces. \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an attack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and combatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies to both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' Additional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures that persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a conflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military objects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians (Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a reasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or destruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct military advantages expected\". When it comes to applying IHL principles to the area of \n1085\ncyber warfare, one of the most critical questions will be determining to what degree the term \"harm\" covers loss of functionality (Fenrick,1982). \nOn the other hand, as previously stated, it is unclear exactly which sorts of functional disruptions come within the relevant group of damage. Another issue in implementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected accidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military advantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against anticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of Cyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which types of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in implementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. The challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates the problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new notion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the interconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible outcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents against the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be observed in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of military operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and their objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific precautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or deciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military objectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and means of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk that the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must be required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a cyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that the planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack will not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to identify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well as the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the competence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. Targets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in such a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the purpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military objectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional armed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in any attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that parties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population objectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure must have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military cyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n1086\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nthem is considered not to be deemed easy. Belligerents would also have to take all necessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-attacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated and providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result of an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be held responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. To put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed conflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations (Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that aim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian groups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed conflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health ministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 civilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in this armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations of International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any violations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability. \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the attacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to a person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical destruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere inconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to economic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York Exchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which causes no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that this research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare. \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical harm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with the view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack on the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine the sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, especially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on their territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government authorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to civilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage to physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is international and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is unable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next research finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or evaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare. \n1087\nConclusion \nCyberwar refers to an attack on computer systems by means of the digital world, Even if the data center included government records, firing a missile against it would not be deemed Cyber Warfare. and using hackers to spy on or steal data would not be considered cyber warfare in itself, but rather cyber espionage, which is carried out by practically all nations of the world. This chapter has concluded this research that a new treaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare. \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey area), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is scaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of cyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared to be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international community, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, and, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, however, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence the governance aspects are still not covered. \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in cyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from international conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and China appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power relationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. Following the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of them. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and individual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. However, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought with it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. Cyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a number of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case was investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in kinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a general framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to understand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current IHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty focusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n1088\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nReferences \nAskin, K.

Computer systems are often not the end target of attackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. Attacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer networks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer network systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have codes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as effective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. Cyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic armed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the identification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, and how much damage they wreak using malware. Cyber Warfare is a fight between two \nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nnations, not between individuals. Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual hacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and engaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. Hackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal status of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that may handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, unorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has created a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law to investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how International Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the Tallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's capital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique the existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique has been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority for the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its enforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical analysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber Warfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is qualitative.\n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be used for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while secondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, books, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated under IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether a cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules apply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will take time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military operation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-physical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL often called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between civilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence its principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL doesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed cyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN Charter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute its tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways of war, it must be understood and react to these issues. Technology has created a new \n1077\nbattleground. IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. Conflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. Cyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and combatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, numerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're illegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of the IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL doesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. This study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one of the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to prohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child soldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts during wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new protocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children under 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting parties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. Additional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must investigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit convention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons beforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI might entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This could be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer Robots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. IHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely to employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about weaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). The following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant on IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and computer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military operations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and development, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, and energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone governments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' infrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most scholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n1078\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \ndemands an international legal reaction. The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated under international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers and advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't decided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. After describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare incidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of difference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to participate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. Many cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely to have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and methods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to encourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on how to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined above. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies may concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or kinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015)Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never happened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in the future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we can say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International Law. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than the kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and hacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because damages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international peace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with aim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy embedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011)As for instance, disrupting electricity grids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do not inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by the state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace (Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The reputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less as well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber Warfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the Hundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second World Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare would not take that long if it happens in the future. \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred framework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear weapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear war) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework to cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n1079\ndates back to the 1920s/30s. deterrence theory get more prominent and developed to its present form in times of the Cold War, between the US and Soviet Union. The US Army analyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and any other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a series of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick retaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution requires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must thus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human beings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the rise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a weapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending competition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the defensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form of threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has brought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence theory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first recognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The difficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber Warfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a need for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is now considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency on the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with great power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure rotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely guided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like space mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle beams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical assets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate them. \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its military is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and communication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. Not only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it also extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new kind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology are now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using viruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending on anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted in International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are already ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively target those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more expansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an imagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n1080\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nJust War Theory \nJust war theory has developed many centuries into its present form, the justification of war is evident from the defensive response from states or the United States Security authorization. The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to maintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways to justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some scholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that wrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive and preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These concepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and may be modified in the future Just War Theory. \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government militaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for actors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national infrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the digital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other use of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not different. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some scholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering morality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties and Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra damages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International Humanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent few years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied to cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare. \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the results of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And this permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as Cyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still needed to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this applicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International Community in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber Warfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is not addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation in the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber Warfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary apparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has also changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the Geneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application a little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal political recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of IAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against each other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international organization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n1081\nThe definition of International Armed Conflict has been provided in Common Article 2 (1) to the four Geneva Conventions, which brings about the application of International Humanitarian Law. However, the rules that are applicable to No-international armed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, without giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict. \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at the international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. The matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of conventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at an international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts at the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times. Conflicts occur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed conflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable to the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the state party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but involves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-international Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both the State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. Recognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the insurgent group; \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. non-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and military forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups. Hostilities must reach a particular level of severity and the parties engaged must be well-organized in order to be classified as an international armed conflict. NIACs, as defined in common Article 3 and NIACs as described in Article 1 of Additional Protocol II, are distinguished under IHL treaty law. \n\uf0d8Common Article 3 relates to non-international armed conflicts that occur on the territory of a high contracting party. Armed conflicts in which one or more established non-State armed organizations which involved and classified as these. NIACs between state armed forces and organized non-state organizations may occur or may occur only between such groups. \n\uf0d8It establishes the necessary territorial control, enabling organized non-state armed organizations to use that territorial control and are capable to carry out a prepared and powerful armed attack in order to implement the Protocol. \n\uf0d8The armed conflicts which happen between two or more independent nations with military forces and other organized armed groups Additional protocol II directly \n1082\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \napplies to such kinds of conflicts, unlike common Article 3 of Additional Protocol II does not apply to armed conflict of Non-state organized armed groups. \nIt is important to remember that the Additional Protocol II helps to improve and supplements common Article 3 without adjusting its current form of application, which means that this definition applies only to the validity of the Additional Protocol II, it does not apply to non-international armed conflicts. \nRichard Baxter has written about the Vietnam War, he stated that though He added that, although it is easy to demonstrate that the US participation in the war has internationalized the conflict under Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions (1949), the entire law of war may be applicable. The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\t\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of Nicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by the law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed by the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context of pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the idea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International Humanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such operations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always been one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its rules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The context in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules and principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber operations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability completely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a doubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown below. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection between the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In another way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not govern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the scope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under IHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold relationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into consideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. A cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed conflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international character and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, Partsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any other armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting parties does not consider the situation to be a war. Article 1 of Additional Protocol II of \n1083\n1977, on the other side, says that the protocol may be applied to all forms of armed conflicts involving military forces of a High Contracting Party and rebel armed groups or other organized armed groups that happen on the land of the High Contracting Party.IHL applies to both kinds of situations of international and non-international armed conflicts, as these two articles make clear (Droege, 2012). \nThere are two kinds of armed conflicts mentioned earlier, \n1.Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating colonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict between two or more states. \n2.non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or if it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber operations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are governed by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or in addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack on the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks and cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-attack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state employees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event of an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to interrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet the basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power grids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil pipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all are heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and operation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency between civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian objects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \n\tPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian population are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and suffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to the principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military necessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and are not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed conflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities (Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, necessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is based on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance the expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n1084\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nobjects. If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the equation, military necessity is the other. \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is necessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not otherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not withdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, and may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they are or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more restrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always employing restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions may be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is essential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's military foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its primary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of military advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor of the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is best described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of military force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of IHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons who are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to safeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured civilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. Petersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the enemy state by attacking only its military forces. \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an attack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and combatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies to both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' Additional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures that persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a conflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military objects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians (Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a reasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or destruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct military advantages expected\". When it comes to applying IHL principles to the area of \n1085\ncyber warfare, one of the most critical questions will be determining to what degree the term \"harm\" covers loss of functionality (Fenrick,1982). \nOn the other hand, as previously stated, it is unclear exactly which sorts of functional disruptions come within the relevant group of damage. Another issue in implementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected accidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military advantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against anticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of Cyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which types of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in implementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. The challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates the problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new notion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the interconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible outcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents against the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be observed in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of military operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and their objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific precautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or deciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military objectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and means of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk that the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must be required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a cyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that the planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack will not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to identify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well as the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the competence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. Targets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in such a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the purpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military objectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional armed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in any attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that parties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population objectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure must have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military cyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n1086\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nthem is considered not to be deemed easy. Belligerents would also have to take all necessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-attacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated and providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result of an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be held responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. To put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed conflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations (Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that aim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian groups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed conflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health ministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 civilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in this armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations of International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any violations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability. \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the attacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to a person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical destruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere inconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to economic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York Exchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which causes no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that this research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare. \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical harm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with the view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack on the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine the sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, especially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on their territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government authorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to civilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage to physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is international and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is unable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next research finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or evaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare. \n1087\nConclusion \nCyberwar refers to an attack on computer systems by means of the digital world, Even if the data center included government records, firing a missile against it would not be deemed Cyber Warfare. and using hackers to spy on or steal data would not be considered cyber warfare in itself, but rather cyber espionage, which is carried out by practically all nations of the world. This chapter has concluded this research that a new treaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare. \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey area), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is scaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of cyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared to be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international community, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, and, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, however, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence the governance aspects are still not covered. \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in cyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from international conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and China appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power relationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. Following the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of them. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and individual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. However, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought with it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. Cyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a number of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case was investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in kinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a general framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to understand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current IHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty focusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n1088\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nReferences \nAskin, K.

Computer systems are often not the end target of attackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. Attacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer networks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer network systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have codes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as effective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. Cyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic armed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. \nCyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the identification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, and how much damage they wreak using malware. Cyber Warfare is a fight between two \nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nnations, not between individuals. Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual hacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and engaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. Hackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal status of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that may handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, unorganized, and susceptible to interpretation. \nMany governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has created a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law to investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how International Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the Tallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's capital, Tallinn. \nMaterial and Methods \nThis work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique the existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique has been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority for the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its enforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical analysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber Warfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is qualitative.\n It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be used for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while secondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, books, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon. \nCyberwarfare Arguments \nIHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated under IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether a cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules apply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will take time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military operation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-physical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL often called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between civilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence its principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL doesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed cyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN Charter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers. \nIHL Struggles \nThis current world defies The Laws of War (IHL). To guarantee that IHL can execute its tasks in times of armed conflict and is fair enough to cope with current means and ways of war, it must be understood and react to these issues. Technology has created a new \n1077\nbattleground. IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. Conflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. Cyberwarfare will be emphasized. \nRebels \nIHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and combatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, numerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're illegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of the IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL doesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. This study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants. \nInfantry \nChild soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one of the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to prohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child soldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts during wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new protocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children under 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting parties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. Additional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers. \nKiller Robots \nKiller robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must investigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit convention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons beforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI might entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This could be a problem for the international community. \nNearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer Robots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. IHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely to employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about weaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). The following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare. \nCyber Krieg \nBeginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant on IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and computer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military operations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and development, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, and energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone governments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' infrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets. \nCyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL). Most scholars agree that IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. Cyberwarfare is 'international' and \n1078\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \ndemands an international legal reaction. The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated under international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers and advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't decided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. After describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare incidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of difference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to participate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. \nCyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. Many cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely to have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and methods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to encourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on how to conduct these attacks. \nSome of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined above. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies may concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare \nThere are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or kinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015)Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never happened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in the future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we can say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International Law. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than the kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and hacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because damages do so only indirectly. \n To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international peace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with aim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy embedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011)As for instance, disrupting electricity grids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do not inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by the state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace (Rid, 2013). \nSecondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The reputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less as well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber Warfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the Hundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second World Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare would not take that long if it happens in the future. \nDeterrence Theory \nDuring the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred framework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear weapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear war) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework to cyberspace, as cyber deterrence. The concept of deterrence related to military operations \n1079\ndates back to the 1920s/30s. deterrence theory get more prominent and developed to its present form in times of the Cold War, between the US and Soviet Union. The US Army analyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and any other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a series of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997). \nAs we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick retaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution requires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must thus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human beings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the rise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a weapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending competition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the defensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form of threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has brought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011). The deterrence theory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first recognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The difficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber Warfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a need for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare. \nRealist Theory \nThere is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is now considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency on the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with great power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure rotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely guided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like space mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle beams and leaser (Carter, 1984) Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical assets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate them. \nThe electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its military is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and communication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. Not only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it also extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new kind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology are now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using viruses (Mosteanu, 2020) \nThese threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending on anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted in International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are already ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively target those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more expansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an imagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006). \n1080\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nJust War Theory \nJust war theory has developed many centuries into its present form, the justification of war is evident from the defensive response from states or the United States Security authorization. The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to maintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways to justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some scholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that wrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive and preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These concepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and may be modified in the future Just War Theory. \nAs the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government militaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for actors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national infrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the digital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other use of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not different. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some scholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering morality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013). \nGenerally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties and Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra damages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International Humanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent few years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied to cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare. \nBut the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the results of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And this permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as Cyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still needed to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this applicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International Community in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber Warfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is not addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation in the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber Warfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary apparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has also changed in the international domain. \nInternational Armed Conflict (IAC) \nThe concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the Geneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application a little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal political recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of IAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against each other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international organization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict. \n1081\nThe definition of International Armed Conflict has been provided in Common Article 2 (1) to the four Geneva Conventions, which brings about the application of International Humanitarian Law. However, the rules that are applicable to No-international armed conflict have been given under Common Article 3 to the four Geneva Conventions, without giving a clear and comprehensive definition of such kind of conflict. \n The jurisprudence of the international tribunal and the first 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions have expanded the definition of an armed conflict at the international level, and have also provided criteria for interpretation of this definition. The matter involved in those definitions lies in the responsibility to respect rules of conventional and customary humanitarian law, especially, it is applicable to the conflicts at an international level rather than the more limited rules applicable to those armed conflicts at the non-international level. \nNon-International Armed Conflict \nInternational Humanitarian Law governs the situation during war times. Conflicts occur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed conflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable to the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the state party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but involves two or more armed groups. The principles of IHL may be applied to non-international Armed Conflicts under extremely limited circumstances, such as when both the State involved and a third State acknowledge the insurgent group's belligerency. Recognition of belligerency is allowed thereby triggering the applicability of IHL if the insurgent group; \n The majority number of conflicts presently are of a non-international character. non-international armed conflicts occur when hostilities emerge between government and military forces, organized non-state armed groups, or such groups. Hostilities must reach a particular level of severity and the parties engaged must be well-organized in order to be classified as an international armed conflict. NIACs, as defined in common Article 3 and NIACs as described in Article 1 of Additional Protocol II, are distinguished under IHL treaty law. \n\uf0d8Common Article 3 relates to non-international armed conflicts that occur on the territory of a high contracting party. Armed conflicts in which one or more established non-State armed organizations which involved and classified as these. NIACs between state armed forces and organized non-state organizations may occur or may occur only between such groups. \n\uf0d8It establishes the necessary territorial control, enabling organized non-state armed organizations to use that territorial control and are capable to carry out a prepared and powerful armed attack in order to implement the Protocol. \n\uf0d8The armed conflicts which happen between two or more independent nations with military forces and other organized armed groups Additional protocol II directly \n1082\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \napplies to such kinds of conflicts, unlike common Article 3 of Additional Protocol II does not apply to armed conflict of Non-state organized armed groups. \nIt is important to remember that the Additional Protocol II helps to improve and supplements common Article 3 without adjusting its current form of application, which means that this definition applies only to the validity of the Additional Protocol II, it does not apply to non-international armed conflicts. \nRichard Baxter has written about the Vietnam War, he stated that though He added that, although it is easy to demonstrate that the US participation in the war has internationalized the conflict under Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions (1949), the entire law of war may be applicable. The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \n\t\u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of Nicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. \nThe actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by the law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed by the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980). \nIHL Governing Cyber Warfare \nIHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context of pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the idea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International Humanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such operations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always been one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its rules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The context in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules and principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011). \nThe scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber operations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability completely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a doubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown below. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection between the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In another way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not govern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the scope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under IHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold relationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019). \nIt is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into consideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. A cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed conflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international character and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, Partsch, & Solf, 1982). \n It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any other armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting parties does not consider the situation to be a war. Article 1 of Additional Protocol II of \n1083\n1977, on the other side, says that the protocol may be applied to all forms of armed conflicts involving military forces of a High Contracting Party and rebel armed groups or other organized armed groups that happen on the land of the High Contracting Party.IHL applies to both kinds of situations of international and non-international armed conflicts, as these two articles make clear (Droege, 2012). \nThere are two kinds of armed conflicts mentioned earlier, \n1.Any other armed conflict between two or more states, including combating colonial supremacy, foreign occupation, and racist regimes in the exercise of their right to self-determination, as well as any other armed conflict between two or more states. \n2.non-international armed conflict. \n IHL is, however, applicable in the cyber-attack if it amounts to an armed conflict or if it is done as a part of an armed conflict. It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber operations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are governed by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or in addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack on the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks and cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-attack. \nEven if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state employees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event of an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to interrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet the basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power grids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil pipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all are heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and operation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency between civilian and military structures elevates the dander that civilians and civilian objects will be harmed due to happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014). \nPrinciples of IHL \n\tPrinciples of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian population are as under; \nPrinciple of Military Necessity \nThe Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and suffering caused by armed conflict. The principle of military necessity, which is similar to the principle of proportionality, is a significant part of IHL. The principle of military necessity permits actions that are required to achieve an appropriate military objective and are not banned by international humanitarian law. When there is a situation of an armed conflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities (Benvenisti, 2009). \nThe modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, necessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians. It is based on an indirect and quite often elusive non-arithmetical formula that seeks to balance the expected armed benefits of a given operation against civilian deaths or harm to civilian \n1084\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nobjects. If proportionality is the center of the problem, and humanity is one side of the equation, military necessity is the other. \nMilitary necessity is defined as the ability of the armed forces to do whatever is necessary to achieve their lawful military objectives in warfare, provided that it is not otherwise unlawful in the meaning of IHL, for instance, enemy armed forces that have not withdrawn or are not hors de combat always are legitimate military targets in themselves, and may be attacked by the enemy at any time and in any place, regardless of where they are or what they are doing. (Goodman, 2013), \nIt is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more restrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always employing restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions may be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is essential in terms of military sense. \n An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's military foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its primary goals. The legal idea of military necessity is not commonly similar to that of military advantage and this fact should always be highlighted, (which is a factual descriptor of the consequence upon which activities are predicated). Finally, \"military necessity\" is best described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of military force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of IHL) (Schmitt, 2016). \nPrinciples of Distinction \nThe Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons who are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to safeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured civilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. Petersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the enemy state by attacking only its military forces. \nIn Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an attack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and combatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016). \nThe principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies to both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' Additional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures that persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a conflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military objects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians (Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of operations. \nPrinciple of Proportionality \nUnder the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a reasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or destruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct military advantages expected\". When it comes to applying IHL principles to the area of \n1085\ncyber warfare, one of the most critical questions will be determining to what degree the term \"harm\" covers loss of functionality (Fenrick,1982). \nOn the other hand, as previously stated, it is unclear exactly which sorts of functional disruptions come within the relevant group of damage. Another issue in implementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected accidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military advantage (Dinstein, 2012). \nTo be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against anticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of Cyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which types of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in implementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. The challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates the problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new notion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the interconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible outcomes. \nPrinciple of Precaution \nPrecautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents against the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be observed in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of military operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and their objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific precautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or deciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military objectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and means of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk that the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must be required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006). \n A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a cyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that the planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack will not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to identify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well as the best manner to accomplish this object. The attack must be avoided wholly if the competence required to get and appropriately assess the information required is lost. Targets must be restricted to those targets as to which adequate information is available in such a situation. \n In some cases, the responsibility to select means and methods of warfare with the purpose of decreasing civilian deaths may require belligerents to achieve their military objectives by a cyber-attack rather than using more harmful means such as conventional armed force. The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in any attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that parties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population objectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010). \n While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure must have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state. In reality, civilian and military cyber infrastructure, however, are so interconnected together, and that effort separating \n1086\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nthem is considered not to be deemed easy. Belligerents would also have to take all necessary precautions to protect essential civilian infrastructure from the effects of cyber-attacks, such as ensuring that vital data can be safely stockpiled and effectively associated and providing for rapid restoration of civilian systems that have been damaged as a result of an attack (Droege, 2012). \nThe Principle of Accountability \nEach party to an armed conflict, both states, and non-state armed groups, will be held responsible for complying with the standards of the International Humanitarian Law. To put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed conflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations (Chinkin, 1994). \nFor example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that aim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian groups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed conflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health ministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 civilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in this armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations of International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any violations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability. \nResearch Findings \nFor a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the attacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to a person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical destruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere inconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to economic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York Exchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which causes no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that this research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare. \nHowever, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical harm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with the view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack on the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine the sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem. \n This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, especially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on their territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government authorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to civilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage to physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is international and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is unable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next research finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or evaluated. Likewise, there are issues with the principle of distinction, and proportionality. \nThis leads to the conclusion that IHL is unable to regulate absolutely Cyber Warfare. \n1087\nConclusion \nCyberwar refers to an attack on computer systems by means of the digital world, Even if the data center included government records, firing a missile against it would not be deemed Cyber Warfare. and using hackers to spy on or steal data would not be considered cyber warfare in itself, but rather cyber espionage, which is carried out by practically all nations of the world. This chapter has concluded this research that a new treaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare. \nFor Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey area), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is scaremongering that could lead to dangerous development. \nDuring my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of cyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared to be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international community, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, and, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, however, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence the governance aspects are still not covered. \nThe data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in cyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from international conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and China appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power relationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. Following the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of them. \nThe Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and individual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. However, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought with it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. Cyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a number of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case was investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in kinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a general framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to understand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current IHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty focusing on cyber-warfare must be established. \n1088\nLegal Framework of Right of Self Defense in \nCyber Warfare:  Application through Laws of Armed Conflict \nReferences \nAskin, K.
