The proliferation of technology and widespread internet usage has made electronic evidence (E-Evidence) and Cyber Forensics pivotal in combatting cybercrimes. This shift presents a significant challenge for law enforcement and legal professionals as cyber criminals exploit the virtual landscape for illicit activities. E-Evidence encompasses a broad spectrum of digital data, such as emails, instant messages, social media interactions, cloud storage, and browsing history. Cyber Forensics involves the scientific examination and analysis of this digital evidence to unravel cybercrimes. This paper delves into the core principles of Cyber Forensics, including the identification, preservation, extraction, and analysis of digital evidence while ensuring its integrity and admissibility in court. Despite cybercriminals attempting to conceal their digital footprints, forensic investigators employ tools and methodologies to trace events and identify perpetrators. Additionally, the paper explores legal challenges and ethical dilemmas surrounding E-Evidence and Cyber Forensics. Privacy concerns, maintaining chain of custody, and adhering to data protection laws significantly impact the admissibility and trustworthiness of digital evidence in court. The evolving technological landscape necessitates continual updates to legal frameworks to accommodate digital investigations. E-Evidence and Cyber Forensic techniques are indispensable in combatting cybercrimes. As cyber threats evolve, ongoing research and innovation in this field are crucial.

Maintaining the chain of custody for digital evidence across borders is crucial but problematic.</p>\n    <p>International cooperation, often facilitated by Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs), aims to assist investigations and evidence collection. However, bureaucratic delays in these processes hinder timely information exchange, allowing cybercriminals to evade justice. Political or diplomatic issues may also deter some countries from cooperating, providing safe havens for cybercriminals.</p>\n    <p>Anonymizing technologies like Tor and VPNs further complicate matters by masking the origin of cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals leverage these technologies to obfuscate their location, making it challenging to trace them accurately. Efforts to standardize cybercrime legislation and cooperation frameworks, like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, aim to address these issues, yet gaps persist due to uneven adoption.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 635, "completion_tokens": 375, "total_tokens": 1010}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

Their interdependent relationship plays a pivotal role in identifying and scrutinizing electronic evidence, now an indispensable component of legal procedures. Adapting to the dynamic digital landscape necessitates collaboration among legal practitioners, law enforcement, and forensic experts. It's crucial to modify methodologies in tandem with technological progress while upholding fundamental principles such as transparency, integrity, and safeguarding individual rights.</p>\n  <p>India's accomplishment in keeping pace with technological advancements through significant legislative amendments in response to these changes is commendable for law enforcement agencies and lawmakers. However, ensuring adequate training for Implementing Authorities to effectively execute these provisions is a critical and immediate need.

ALFORD, JR.</h2>\n\n<h3>I. INTRODUCTION.</h3>\n<p>\nTHE WORLD COURT is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations Organization. As a judicial organ, it is probably not indispensable. What would happen to the United Nations Organization without the Court is pure speculation. Quite possibly the General Assembly would compensate for the loss by developing judicial functions much as it has developed executive functions to offset the creeping paralysis of the Security Council. Certainly the loss of the Court would not mean the breakdown of all international machinery for the peaceful settlement of differences. But an efficient World Court may prove to be a major asset of the United Nations by performing three important functions. The Court can give the Organization legal guidance and can handle certain kinds of disputes between States.\n</p>\n<p>\nProfessor of Law, University of Virginia Law School. B.A. 1940. The Citadel; LL.B. 1947, University of Virginia. Portions of this Article will be incorporated into a thesis to be submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an advanced degree in law at the Yale Law School.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"World Court\" is used henceforth to embrace the Permanent Court of International Justice, which functioned from 1922 to 1940, and the International Court of Justice, the present court which began its work in 1946. The Permanent Court was not a part of the League. The International Court of Justice is a part of the United Nations Organization although it has a separate statute. See Hudson, The Succession of the International Court of Justice to the Permanent Court of International Justice, 51 Am. J. INT'L L. 569 (1957).\n</p>\n<p>\nUndiscriminating laymen, particularly those who have lost lawsuits, have observed from time to time that the world might be much better off without lawyers.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe World Court, as of 1956, had given thirty-eight advisory opinions. All of the requests to the Permanent Court of International Justice for advisory opinions were made by the Council of the League. All of the requests to the International Court of Justice, except one made by UNESCO, have been made by the General Assembly. The General Assembly, the Security Council, and other organs of the United Nations and specialized agencies authorized by the General Assembly to make the requests, may request advisory opinions.\n</p>\n<p>\nPrior to World War II, state disputes were sometimes presented to the Court in the form of requests for advisory opinions. This practice is discussed in greater detail subsequently in this Article. With some possible exceptions, such as the right of the United Nations to protect its employees, only a State can be a party to contentious proceedings before the Court. A respondent State cannot be brought before the Court without its consent. Consent may be expressed in a special agreement submitting the case to the Court, or it may be expressed in advance of the dispute by acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction. The \"optional clause\" in the statute of the Court provides a procedure whereby States may accept compulsory jurisdiction in relation to other States accepting the same obligation in certain classes of disputes. These disputes are those that are \"legal\" and which involve a question of treaty interpretation.\n</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 869, "completion_tokens": 680, "total_tokens": 1549}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The legal guidance which the Court gives or the judgment which it renders will be a useless abstraction unless it is based upon actual events, formulated in the light of existing events, and designed to influence the shape of future events. The tendency of national courts to decide cases which are in effect hypothetical because of fact-finding lapses is dismally familiar to lawyers and litigants. The World Court has obstacles to the finding of facts which national courts do not encounter. The tendency of the Court to decide hypothetical cases therefore is stronger. The more efficient the fact finding processes of the World Court become, the better are its opportunities to render useful decisions and give sound legal guidance to the Organization.</p>\n\n<p>The work of the Court as a creator of symbols and the relationship to this work of fact finding are less obvious matters. There is now a plateau in the growth of the United Nations from which we are unlikely to move without a dramatic shift in human attitudes concerning world government. The problem of the Organization is somewhat analogous to that of a human being who must create in his own environment his rational fiction of what he believes himself to be. Once the human being creates his fiction he feels obligated to measure up.</p>\n\n<p>STAT. INT'L CT. JUST. art. 36. The members of the United Nations are ipso facto parties to the statute of the Court, and only parties to the statute can accept compulsory jurisdiction. Thirty-three acceptances of compulsory jurisdiction were in force in 1956, although most of these are expressly subject to a condition of reciprocity and exclude special kinds of disputes.</p>\n\n<p>The United States declaration, for example, excludes disputes essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States as determined by the United States. 15 DEP'T STATE BULL. 452 (1946).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to acceptances of compulsory jurisdiction, a great many treaties made after the establishment of the Permanent Court and before World War n and many treaties being made at the present time provide that disputes concerning interpretation shall be taken to the Court or that appeals may be taken to the Court from decisions of arbitral tribunals which the treaties establish. The statute provides that a reference in a treaty to the Permanent Court will be taken as a reference to the International Court of Justice. STAT. INT'L CT.

If he does not create his fiction for some reason, he has nothing to live up to. Not only is there now lacking any consistent demand from the people of the world that the United Nations be the focal point where national and other differences can be settled peacefully, but the permanent personnel of the Organization and the State officials concerned with its affairs seem to lack a sense of obligation to act boldly to stimulate such a demand. This is not to impugn the good intention or deny the manifest ability of any statesman involved. The observation is intended only to illustrate the point that no dynamic symbol of international government has been created in the minds of men or, apparently, is in the making. A living organization is an image in the minds of men, an image of what men think the organization should be rather than a collection of constitutions, by-laws, organizational routines, functonaries and filing cabinets.</p>\n\n<p>Ignoring for immediate purposes the complex variables that are involved in establishing a pattern of human conduct, three basic steps are necessary to create a leadership symbol in the mind of a man. He must be provoked to respond to a principle since a response to principle is more intense and enduring than a response to other stimuli. He must also be permitted to respond to inconsistent principles. A man is prepared to give his primary loyalty to a leadership symbol if he can reserve loyalty to secondary symbols. If loyalty to secondary symbols is not permitted, loyalty to a primary leadership symbol is never developed or, if developed, is greatly weakened. A man stoutly resists slavery of his mind. It is in his mind that the defenses of self-respect are erected. It has been aptly remarked that a loss of self-respect is the first step to treason. But a third step is also necessary to create a new leadership symbol. The mind must be helped to reconcile its response to inconsistent principles. Some rational and acceptable explanation must be forthcoming to justify response to a primary leadership symbol while a response to other symbols is continued. New leadership symbols are constructed in the human mind and old symbols are diffused or subordinated in importance in this process of reconciling conflicting principles.</p>\n\n<p>It is in the third basic step in developing leadership symbols that the judicial system of an emerging political society usually figures so prominently. In England, for example, the Common Law courts hammered out the concept of a fictional and responsible Crown to which paramount loyalty was due.

Again, the Commerce Clause has been applied by the Supreme Court of the United States to events produced by a growing industrial society in such a way that the federal government has assumed the direction of economic affairs while the role of state authority has been correspondingly reduced. The task of the World Court is to create an image of the United Nations in the minds of men as a primary leadership symbol without eroding to any appreciable degree the response of men to State and other parochial symbols.</p>\n    <p>The part played by courts in developing leadership symbols in the early stages of formation of a political society differs radically from their role when a political society has matured. When leadership symbols have been developed and are firmly implanted, an insistence upon loyalty to primary leadership symbols appears to produce minor but frequent shifts in attitudes concerning subordinate symbols. In this situation, the minds of men are more easily manipulated through representative bodies with flexible procedures and in close contact with the daily life of a community than the courts. In the United States, the disorderly growth of fraternal benefit societies and business corporations after the Civil War required action by the Congress or by the state legislatures. The courts could not deal with public utility holding companies in the Twentieth Century until the Congress enacted legislation for that purpose. The function of a court in a matured political society tends to become of an interstitial and housekeeping nature. The court of an emerging political society must be a laborer of all work.</p>\n    <p>Since peace was sought unsuccessfully in the League experiment, it would not have been shocking to those who follow the work of international organizations closely if the San Francisco Conference had produced an international court system designed to spark a sound and orderly growth of world government. It is the drive for resolution of conflict that provides the incentive for the formation of new political societies. As a principal resolver of conflict, the adjudicator has always been an obvious choice, for it is in its courts that an emerging government has its closest contact with the governed. But a court in an inchoate political system must be more than the simple adjudicator. The term \"interstitial\" is used here in the sense that the Court functions as an auxiliary to institutions which are charged with the continuous making, undoing and remaking of policies that the management of a complex community requires. The Court, of course, creates conditions under which policies are made by other institutions, but it does this spasmodically without clear cut policing of the effects of its decisions and consequent necessary adjustments.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 741, "completion_tokens": 547, "total_tokens": 1288}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It must have the power and the techniques to build a symbol of its own authority and the authority of the government it represents. The World Court must be able to direct its efforts into two channels. A leadership image must be created in the minds of the officials responsible for the affairs of the United Nations, and the necessary transfusion of ideas to the Organization must be administered to keep the image alive. The Court must also be able to aid in shaping and restricting the growth of the leadership symbol which these officials may possibly succeed in engrafting in the minds of the mass of men. We are not now concerned with the role of the World Court in a matured political society. That problem can be faced many generations hence by people better prepared to deal with it.</p>\n\n<p>The Court established at San Francisco in 1945 is primarily an adjudicating institution in the \"national\" sense. The statute of the Court is almost the same as that of the Permanent Court of International Justice with which it maintains, practically speaking, an unbroken tradition and skein of experience. To the ordinary man, the man whose influence will determine ultimately whether there will be effective international organization or not, the World Court is as remote as the Supreme Court of Saturn. The statute of the Court can be formally amended only in the manner provided for amendment of the Charter of the United Nations. Neither the statute nor the charter are likely to be amended at any time in the foreseeable future. What can be done to utilize the Court in such a way that its work will enhance the appeal of the United Nations to the \"mass mind\" as a leadership symbol and thus increase the prestige and effective action of the Organization at a time when effective action is sorely needed? How can this be done without amending formally the statute of the Court? The writer does not pretend to have pat answers to either of these questions, and doubts that anyone does. The Court is in a good tactical position for a move towards greater power. The Court is the final.</p>\n\n<p>Consider in this connection two of the advisory opinions rendered by the World Court. In Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations, Advisory Opinion of April 11, 1949, [1949] I.C.J. Rep. 174, the Court held that the United Nations had the status to make an international claim to protect its agents. In Effect of Awards of Compensation Made by the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, Advisory Opinion of July 13, 1954, [1954] I.C.J. Rep. 47, the Court held that the United Nations had implied power to establish an administrative tribunal to handle its internal administration.</p>\n\n<p>It is a Court designed for interstitial operations in a society which has no interstices. There is no continuous legislative or executive body in the world community, the action of the single major executive body having been blocked by the veto.

Only the States have access to the Court in contentious proceedings and they must be pre- pared to bring cases before it. The General Assembly and other inter- national organizations which are authorized to seek advisory opinions must be prepared to seek the opinions and ask the proper questions. The Court will lose its major basis of power if it forfeits its enviable position of respect and loses its reputation for integrity. Those who seek more for the Court and for the United Nations must tread lightly and speak softly.</p>\n\n<p>The single factor that perhaps will prove most rewarding if given adequate attention is improvement of the fact-finding techniques of the Court. Improvements in fact-finding techniques will arouse less opposition than direct demands for compulsory jurisdiction or re- lated extensions of the Court's statutory powers. Many such improvements might be made without formal amendment of the statute. Improvements in fact-finding techniques will tend to bring the Court into direct contact with the individual and thus within the attention frame of the individual whose mind is an influence target. A major need today is not access of individuals to the Court but access of the Court to individuals. Historically, improvement of fact-finding techniques has presaged an elaboration of court organization, an extension of jur- isdiction and, ultimately, an increase in judicial influence. This de- velopment may occur in the case of the World Court.</p>\n\n<p>The concept that a court should be used for anything except the decision of cases is a somewhat dangerous one. The hazards involved in turning courts to political ends are well documented, e.g., United States v. Alstoetter, 3 Nurenberg Military Tribunals, Trials of War Criminals, Case 3 at 31 (1947); VYssIINSKY, THE LAW of THE SovIET STATE 497-98 (1951). A number of the able jurists associated with the Permanent Court or the International Court of Justice have argued for moderation in seeking an extension of the Court's authority or more reasonable expectations concerning the type of work the Court is to do. E.G., DeVisscher, Reflections on the Present Prospects of International Adjudication, 50 AM. J. INT'L L. 467 (1956). Judge Krylov in his dissenting opinion in Admission of a State to the United Nations (Charter, Art. 4), Advisory Opinion of May 28, 1948, [1947-1948] I.C.J. Rep. 57, quotes Judge Hudson, a former Judge of the Permanent Court, upon the point that the activity of the Court should not be \"artificially stimulated.\"</p>\n\n<p>In certain rare instances individuals have had an opportunity to get their cases before the Court. In Danzig Legislative Decrees, P.C.I.J., Ser. A/B, No. 65 (advisory opinion 1935), the Court considered a dispute concerning a statute enacted by the Danzig Senate applying the criminal law doctrine of analogy. The Court determined that the Free City of Danzig should have State status for this proceeding. This meant, in effect, that the Court would hear only one side of the case since the Senate represented the Free City and the Senate was Nazi-controlled. The President of the Court therefore received an explanatory note from the opposing political parties in Danzig, although these parties were not allowed to be represented in the oral proceedings.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 982, "completion_tokens": 731, "total_tokens": 1713}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The exclusion of fact in the Anglo-American judicial duel has come to be taken for granted by American judges and lawyers. The burden is on the opponent to produce the facts and, if he can be kept from getting them in, so much the better for the client. The practice has been tolerated not only because of the lawyer's affection for tradition but because the judge does not have the time to set out upon extensive fact-finding inquiries of his own. The judge is an umpire at trial. The judge on appeal tends to accept the facts produced at trial. There is no reason why this situation should exist in cases brought before the World Court. The General List of the Court is not overcrowded and the judges, or at least most of them, are not imbued with Anglo-American legal traditions. Why are the parties allowed to perform the major fact-finding function before the World Court? Who makes the decisions which determine who finds the facts?</p>\n\n<p>The statute of the Court sets forth the major outlines of the fact-finding missions which the Court can pursue. Since the statute is based upon State consent and State consent pervades the entire problem of the Court's jurisdiction, it is understandable that special deference should be shown to the statements made by State representatives and the facts produced by them. Nevertheless, in spite of the very real obstacle that State consent presents in fact-finding, this single factor cannot explain why the Court has not moved with greater freedom in finding facts within the confines that its statute establishes. Two factors appear to account for the reticence of the Court, particularly in contentious cases, to make independent inquiries. The Court has been prone to regard executive-administrative findings-of-fact as conclusive because of the limitations set by the statute upon its own fact-finding activities. This predisposition has carried over into contentious litigation, the State being treated as an administrative fact-finder whose conclusions must be accepted at face value unless manifestly questionable. Likewise, in the history of the Permanent Court, there were efforts to use the Court as a fact-finding institution for the League and other international organizations.

The Notion of Executive-Administrative Finality.</h3>\n  <p>In the Anglo-American and Civil Law judicial systems the theory of finality of administrative and legislative findings-of-fact has been firmly implanted. The theory may be based upon constitutional separation of powers, upon a need for efficiency in sifting voluminous facts or upon the inability of the Court to appraise remote events. It is understandable that judges trained in the Anglo-American and Civil Law systems should tend to apply these theories to the work of the World Court. There is also more justification for the application of theories of finality when the fact-finding ability of the Court is substantially curtailed. The Court has no processes to compel the production of evidence. It may request of public international organizations information relative to cases before it, and may call upon the agents to produce any document or supply any explanation. Relevant questions may be put to witnesses and experts. But the Court must depend upon the consent of States to produce witnesses or permit the making of inquiries on the spot.

Upon the assumption that the Court might be prepared in some contentious cases to make independent inquiries into facts, what opportunities for independent inquiry are open to the Court? At the present time, the Court seems to take it for granted that if the parties are in agreement on the facts, the facts agreed upon will be taken as the basis of the decision. In this situation the State parties determine the allocation of intelligence tasks.</p>\n  <p>The likelihood of a dispute as to facts is fairly remote.

Records may be lost, the events in question may have occurred within the territory of one of the parties, or the case might be pitched on events long passed. When the facts do get into dispute in the usual proceeding on the merits it is because one of the parties by espionage or other informal practices has succeeded in penetrating the barriers to the flow of information established by the other.</p>\n  <p>In the Oscar Chinn Case the British were unable to dispute the Belgian allegations of fact concerning the de facto monopoly alleged by the British because the evidence the British needed was in the Belgian Congo. The British had no access to the facts and the Court was not prepared to get the facts for them. In the Nottebohm Case Guatemala could not make an issue of fact concerning the alleged fraud of Nottebohm in obtaining Liechtenstein nationality because it could not have access to the necessary records in Liechtenstein. In the Corfu Channel Case the British took the necessary evidence to raise an issue of fact with Albania by sweeping mines in the Corfu Channel over Albania's protest.

If the Court is confronted with a dispute of fact, the dispute tends to be eased upon information obtained informally so that the Court is likely to have difficulty in any investigation it undertakes. If the facts are not disputed by the parties, there are several situations in contentious proceedings in which the Court might see fit to make independent inquiries but has not yet done so to any appreciable extent. In a number of contentious cases the Court must hear a preliminary objection to its jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits. The Court determines its own jurisdiction but clearly cannot do so unless some of the facts of the case are considered. The Court has taken a pragmatic approach to the problem by holding that if an excursion into facts is necessary on the issue of jurisdiction, the facts will be considered de novo on the merits. This is painless dentistry. If a State appears to raise the issue of jurisdiction and is not cooperative in producing facts, the Court may take the position that it is free to investigate for the limited purpose of determining its jurisdiction.

The Court, however, can not interpret in the abstract its own judgment any more than a Court can interpret a statute of a legislature without considering the facts to which it is being applied.</p>\n    <p>In the Case of Interpretation of Judgments Nos. 7 and 8 (The Chorzow Factory), the Court agreed to interpret a passage in Judgment No. 7: \"If Poland wishes to dispute the validity of this entry, it can, in any case, only be annulled in pursuance of a decision given by the competent tribunal.\" Poland had contended that the land-book entry was invalid, and, after the judgment, commenced a proceeding before the Tribunal of Katowice to annul it.

No effort is made to discuss rules of evidence exhaustively since several excellent treatments of this subject are now in print.</p>\n<p>There have been few contentious cases before the Court in which the parties have disputed the facts. Of these, the Corfu Channel Case sheds more light upon the difficulties of independent inquiry by the Court than any other. The case is a judicial landmark and figures prominently in the subsequent discussion.</p>\n<p>In view of numerous references to this case in the subsequent materials, the facts of the case are stated briefly here. On October 22, 1946, two British destroyers, H.M.S. \"Saumarez\" and H.M.S. \"Volage\" struck mines while passing through the fairway of the Corfu Channel. These vessels were part of a squadron passing through the Channel subject to secret British orders X.C.U. Upon receipt of the report of the mining, the Central International Mine Clearance Board recommended that the channel be reswept at a favorable opportunity (the channel having been swept prior to October 1946), but stated that the sweeping of the channel remained an issue outside its scope. The British nevertheless swept the channel on the 12th and 13th of November, 1946 (Operation Retail). A member of the Mediterranean Mine Clearance Board, Commander Mestre, attended the sweeping as an observer. Two German G-Y mines were recovered and taken to Malta for inspection. Diplomatic negotiations with Albania having failed, the British took the case before the Security Council under Article 35 of the Charter. Albania accepted an invitation to attend the Security Council proceedings upon condition of her acceptance, for the purposes of the dispute, of the obligations of a member of the United Nations. The Security Council appointed a subcommittee to investigate the facts, and the report of this committee was considered by the Council. Ultimately, a finding by the Council adverse to Albania was blocked by the veto, but a British resolution referred the case to the World Court.</p>\n<p>The British brought the case before the Court by application, and Albania raised a preliminary question of jurisdiction on the ground that the case should have been submitted by special agreement. The Court decided that it was unnecessary to pass upon this issue because Albania had voluntarily accepted its jurisdiction by a letter of July 2, 1947. Corfu Channel Case (Preliminary Objection), Judgment of March 25, 1948, [1947-48] I.C.J. Rep. 15.</p>\n<p>Immediately after this decision, the case was submitted by special agreement. The claim of the United Kingdom in this agreement was Albanian responsibility for the explosions and liability for the resulting damages. The British case was that the mines were laid by Yugoslavia with Albanian connivance or that Albania knew the mines had been laid and failed to give notice as required by international law. Albania counterclaimed that the United Kingdom had violated her sovereignty on October 22, 1946, not having been in innocent passage, and had again violated her sovereignty in Operation Retail on the 12th and 13th of November 1946. After hearing witnesses and directing an expert inquiry on the spot, the Court gave judgment for the British on their claim on the ground that Albania knew or should have known of the mining and failed to give warning; the court gave judgment for Albania on that part of her counterclaim pertaining to Operation Retail. The Court determined the indemnity in a separate proceeding in which Albania refused to participate. A second committee of experts was formed to aid the Court in determining the indemnity due.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1077, "completion_tokens": 821, "total_tokens": 1898}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Twenty-two mines were cut and two mines, which proved to be German mines of the G.Y. type, were recovered and taken to Malta. The mines appeared to have been laid a short time before the incident of 22 October. The Court admitted evidence obtained from examination of the mines and related technical details. In answer to Albania's counterclaim that the United Kingdom had violated her sovereignty in \"Operation Retail,\" the British argued that they were securing evidence for the Court which might have been lost if the mines had been removed by Albania or had been equipped with automatic flooding devices. The British also argued that self help justified their action. Both arguments were rejected by the Court and the United Kingdom was held liable on the counterclaim. The evidence obtained, however, formed part of the basis for the decision of the Court that Albania was liable to the United Kingdom on the British claim.</p>\n<p>An exclusion of evidence by the Court based upon the way in which it was secured would be unrealistic in view of the known barriers established by States to the flow of information.

Judicial Notice.</p>\n<p>The judges of the Court often bring to a case facts that have not, strictly speaking, been introduced in evidence. In the nature of the work of the judges of the Court and in view of the kind of case with which the Court deals, the judge cannot be a stranger to a case in the sense that a judge of a national court may hear a case for the first time when it is argued before him.

To create and preserve the Internet as a public good, concerted global action is needed on the basis of a common norm, which makes states mutually responsible for their diligence in national regulatory processes.

The political rules adopted for an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy will always lag behind technological developments. It is the more important, therefore, that new regulations be subordinated to an overarching norm. Three crucial political requirements arise from this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>European cooperation: integrating national policies into the European framework;</li>\n<li>Inclusiveness: giving different interest groups broad and publicly accessible representation in formulating policies;</li>\n<li>Civilian response: prioritising the civilian component over the military component, particularly in times of peace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>European cooperation</h3>\n<p>Due diligence demands that states behave responsibly not only towards one another, but also in internal and home affairs regulatory practices. The EU\u2019s 2013 cybersecurity strategy already provided for this. As part of implementing the EU directive on network and information security (NIS), all EU states must introduce minimum standards and reporting requirements for IT security, and operators of critical infrastructure must be involved in fighting cybercrime. To establish the digital single market, national regulations in civil law (data protection), commercial law (Internet Governance) and competition law (domestic market) must be worded in such a way as to fulfil due diligence obligations. To accelerate this process, it will be advisable quickly to pass the EU\u2019s planned Global Strategy for cyberspace. NATO and EU members largely agree that states are responsible for their own behaviour in cyberspace. There is close consultation among Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d on all of these issues, as well as with the group of likeminded western states. European and western states represented in the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) should use the upcoming fifth round of UN GGE negotiations to campaign for the fight against cybercrime, by adapting their substantive criminal law. The minimum conditions for global cybersecurity are ratifying the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as well as continuous confidence- and security-building measures (CSBM) in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>\n\n<h3>Inclusiveness</h3>\n<p>The UN summit in December 2015, which was part of the WSIS (World Summit on the Information Society) follow-up process, showed that a worldwide agreement on a binding interpretation of due diligence is unlikely in the short term. Therefore, the decision taken in December 2015 to continue the Internet Governance Forum \u2013 in other words, to keep pursuing the multi-stakeholder approach \u2013 still offers the best chance of preventing the idea of a global free and open Internet from falling victim to governments\u2019 intensifying security considerations. In Internet Governance, it is therefore crucial to support the multi-stakeholder approach (interpreted inclusively) and to reject the principle of intergovernmental decision-making. The experience of the WSIS process of the past ten years has clearly shown the ineffectiveness of intergovernmental decision-making. In addition, it would be important to make the norm of due diligence binding on all stakeholders: private users, access-network operators and operators of transmission networks and Internet exchanges. In the long term, arbitration authorities ought to ensure that due diligence is properly implemented.</p>\n\n<h3>Civilian response</h3>\n<p>Initiatives such as a national strategy to protect the economy and industry against espionage back strengthened defensive intelligence capabilities. However, the German Ministry of Defense indicates that it wants to build additional defensive capabilities for reacting to cyber attacks. It would not be advisable for the government to evolve towards an offensive cyberdefence. That would not only be in open contradiction with the idea of due diligence in cyberdiplomacy, but it would also bring with it the risk of conflict escalation and a proliferation of cyber attacks. It is common sense that cyber attacks are difficult to attribute and retaliatory attacks can cause serious unintended damage. The June 2015 attack on the German Federal Parliament showed how vital it is to persist in developing resilient structures. Declaring a given act a violation of sovereignty; having recourse to NATO solidarity; or declaring cyberwar against Islamic State, as the US did, must be seen as the last resorts of politics. Further resources are necessary to prop up a strategy based on resilience: for high-security technology, for developing digital forensics, and for extensive further-training measures to heighten awareness among civil servants, scientists, academics and researchers. Confidence-building measures within the OSCE, capacity-building in third countries under the leadership of the EU and the GGE must be intensified. This is the only realistic basis for achieving bilateral agreements that improve cooperation in solving and prosecuting cross-border digital crimes and remove so-called \u201dsafe havens\u201d. A recent example of this is the accord between the US and China on fighting cybercrime.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1238, "completion_tokens": 981, "total_tokens": 2219}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

The UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), in which Germany is represented, picked up this idea in its final report of June 2015. According to the report, all states shall ensure that their territories, and especially the computersystems and infrastructure situated there or otherwise under the states\u2019 control, is not misused for attacks on the infrastructure of other states.</p>\n    <p>Due diligence is usually translated in international law treaties by the rather problematic term \u201cSorgfalts-pflicht\u201d. However, this term only refers to restrictions on one\u2019s own conduct. It is therefore more meaningful to use \u201cSorgfaltsverantwortung\u201d for due diligence. The principle of due diligence derives its particular normative force from the idea that states are not only responsible for keeping law and order on their own territories, but also bear responsibility for the external consequences of internal regulations. Decisions taken by individual states increasingly have an impact beyond their national territory. That is why states must exercise care with such decisions and be accountable to one another for them.</p>\n    <p>As far as cyberspace is concerned, states may not simply limit themselves to taking no irresponsible decisions. This study further assumes that safeguarding the Internet needs to the political will by all stakeholders for international cooperation. Accordingly, states in cooperation with other states are obliged to do everything that may be reasonably expected of them to help deliver an \u201copen, free and secure Internet\u201d. This expectation encompasses decision-making processes that meet high standards. This means that available competences should be integrated as far as possible, and that one-sided interest-driven politics should be avoided. In other words, an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy defined by due diligence necessarily also comprises the specific mode of regulation. Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy thus needs to be coordinated at the European level, militarily reticent, and integrated into inclusive and transparent regulatory processes.</p>\n    <p>Due diligence comprises regulatory processes with a high level of representativity and inclusiveness as well as transparency.

The openness of a political system is, in turn, a fundamental prerequisite for states trusting one another so that they can deliver their individual contributions to producing the public good of a \u201csecure cyberspace\u201d. These requirements are far from easy to meet. In a technically challenging area such as international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy, consultations often need to be confidential. Furthermore, the expertise of large companies almost inevitably dominates this field, making it extraordinarily difficult for civil-society representatives or members of parliament to be accepted as competent interlocutors. Special efforts are therefore required to prevent one-sided representations of interests or the instrumentalisation of policy by the industry.</p>\n\n<p>A maxim of Germany\u2019s self-perception in foreign policy states that regulatory practices should be coordinated as closely as possible with its most important European partners. The internal market is so tightly interconnected through digital technologies \u2013 as indeed are its foreign and security policies \u2013 that individual member states\u2019 policies in cyberspace are ineffective in comparison to a regional European approach.</p>\n\n<p>Through its international cyber policy, Germany intends to achieve effective collaboration on cybersecurity in Europe and across the world. German measures to promote a free and secure Internet should therefore always be integrated at the European or transatlantic level. No state can seriously claim to be able to regulate cyberspace on its own. Germany will only be able to gain sufficient negotiating power on the global stage if it coordinates intensively with the leading European cybernations (France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Poland) and if it uses EU structures such as the Friends of the Presidency Group on Cyber Issues (FoP Cyber).

For years, it has been involved in an intensive international exchange of experience and information at the management and professional levels. At the operations level, cooperation with other IT emergency teams is especially important. CERT-Bund belongs to the interdisciplinary International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN). At the domestic level, the BSI initiated the founding of the Allianz f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit (alliance for cybersecurity), which now pools German know-how on cybersecurity and has become the main point of contact for companies and citizens.

In September 2015, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that \u201ca new goal is being developed for cyberspace and IT, both downstream and in the ministry\u201d. The creation of a pool of IT reservists is planned for specific military cyber operations. There are also plans for giving Military Counter-Intelligence (MAD) an expanded counter-intelligence mission for deployment abroad, to cover all persons who might pose a risk to the armed forces\u2019 security or readiness for duty. Acording to Colonel Joachim Smola, permanent representative of the MAD president, the MAD is \u201cmuch more [...] than a purely defensive intelligence service\u201d, but rather a \u201ccomprehensive service provider on security issues, and it advises and supports the German armed forces [...] both at their garrisons and on foreign deployment.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p>At the parliamentary level, currently three main bodies control fundamental areas of the cybersecurity strategy that concerns the Federal Government\u2019s intelligence activities: the parliamentary oversight committee (PKGr), G-10 Committee and the NSA committee of inquiry. The panels of experts \u2013 the digital-agenda committee, interior committee, foreign committee, defence committee \u2013 handle further topics of the international cybersecurity policy. Cyberspace makes no distinction between domestic and foreign policy. Parliament, in its work to uphold democracy and the rule of law, must take this insight into account both conceptually and institutionally. Domestic policy should be adjusted in accordance with due diligence. This is the only way of restoring the citizens\u2019, allies\u2019 and EU partners\u2019 trust lost during the Edward Snowden leaks. Trust is an indispensable prerequisite for European cooperation and politics.</p>\n    <p>However, the implementation of the three major challenges to an international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy \u2013 namely European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response \u2013 still leaves much to be desired: European Cooperation. The methods used at the federal and EU levels to establish an overview of the cyber threat situation are unsatisfactory. To render criminal prosecutions more successful, proposals have been put forward to transform the National Cyberdefence Centre into an umbrella body for IT security (comparable to the Joint Anti-Terrorism Centre), since it does not currently bring together all federal and state authorities. There are also calls for more cooperation between national and EU authorities with a view to a European exchange of information. Some important partners, such as France or the Netherlands, criticise Germany not only because they find the \u201cGerman position\u201d frequently unclear, but also because they do not always know with which ministry to negotiate as part of the European coordination.</p>\n    <p>Moreover, vital coordination at the EU level is sluggish, inter alia because the attribution of specific responsibilities is so complicated. Since the parliamentary elections of 2013, coalition partners have been discussing whether Germany needs an Internet ministry or a so-called digital agency. However, they have only been able to agree on an office without power or resources: the office of Digital Champion of the Federal Government, currently held by Gesche Joost.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1323, "completion_tokens": 660, "total_tokens": 1983}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

In February 2016, the German Federal Cabinet appointed the president of the Cybersecurity Council, Arne Sch\u00f6nbohm, to be the president of the BSI. The public views his links to the IT and arms industries with suspicion. Critics also point out \u201cthat there are six to ten times the resources available for the offensive approach than there are for the defensive approach to cyber attacks or compromised IT security.\u201d Besides, according to a member of the executive board of the Federal Association of the Information Economy, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom), Susanne Dehmel, only one in five companies makes use of the IT consultancies offered by the government. Moreover, companies that have fallen victim to cyber attacks tend to contact their state\u2019s agency for internal security rather than the police, since the latter would have to launch a preliminary investigation wherever a criminal act was suspected. Consultations are underway on reforming the intelligence services as well as improving parliamentary oversight of those services by the PKGr.</p>\n    \n    <p>While the special rapporteur appointed by the Federal Government, Kurt Graulich, did examine the so-called NSA selector lists, which had been passed to the BND, the results leave many questions unanswered. In 2015, the former president of the BfV and BND, Hansj\u00f6rg Geier, argued that a code needed to be elaborated for regulating the exchange of information by intelligence services and that a post of parliamentary ombudsperson for the intelligence services needed to be created, modelled on the parliamentary ombudsperson for the armed forces.</p>\n    \n    <p>Civilian Response</p>\n    <p>The permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Hans-Georg Engelke, who is also the Federal Government\u2019s IT Commissioner, emphasised that it was vital for the authorities to cooperate on IT security, but that the BMI had overall control on issues of cybersecurity. However, this claim is already being questioned as part of the 2016 white-paper discussion. Even the National Cybersecurity Council has not been able to solve the problem of the at-times inefficient distribution of responsibilities. In July 2013, while elucidating the NSA affair, the German Federal Government did publish an eight-point programme on improving protection of the private sphere.

Over the past few decades, automisation has allowed the German economy to respond well to the global pressures to be competitive and innovative. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs wants to further boost small and medium enterprises using its Digital Strategy 2025. Private actors play an extraordinarily important role in the Federal Government\u2019s international cybersecurity policy. Industrial locations gain in strategic importance. The companies located there not only create jobs and added value, but also set competitivity standards for whole economies. The German Federal Government believes that there is still plenty of untapped potential in Germany\u2019s ICT: according to a study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, Intelligent Networks could generate overall benefits to German society worth 56 million euros a year.</p>\n<p>However, other countries have digitalised more successfully. The pioneering companies are mostly American, South Korean and Chinese. In 2014, the German Federal Government launched the programmes Digital Agenda and Digital Management. However, these programmes are meagrely equipped compared with the US government\u2019s programmes for funding research projects, for instance on developing quantum computers or the capability of analysing big-data. The future project Industrie 4.0 has federal funding to the tune of around 200 million euros from the BMBF and BMWI. That is still not nearly enough to make them competitive.

This is also reflected in the Federal Government\u2019s programme Digital Agenda 2014\u20132017. It outlines seven fields of action including the \u201cEuropean and international dimension\u201d. According to the CDU, CSU and SPD coalition agreement, a \u201cEuropean space of trust\u201d is supposed to be created, but primarily with the help of national \u201cmeasures to regain technological sovereignty\u201d.

It expects this market, once realised, to contribute 520 billion euros to EU states\u2019 gross domestic product. However, the Commission currently has only limited means available for developing key digital technologies. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has budgeted about a billion euros spread over seven years for ICT funding for the EU member states. The financing programme Horizon 2020 is making 7.2 billion euros available for research for the EU 28, from 2014\u20132020. Since the Juncker Commission took up its posts in November 2014, the Industrie 4.0 policy has been developed into a digital single market at the EU level with the help of a comprehensive legal package. In the Commission\u2019s view, policies to create and regulate the market, as well as distributive policies should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Attaining the necessary speed is a problem, however, because the Commission first has to harmonise the legal policies of all 28 member states. A number of leading decisions published by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 and 2015 are seen as important milestones of a European or transatlantic agreement on data-security and data protection policy.</p>\n<p>Important decisions in this context are those on the illegality of telecommunications data retention, on the right to be forgotten and on the illegality of the Safe Harbour Agreement. Even the legal status of its successor agreement between the EU and the US, the Privacy Shield, continues to be disputed. Furthermore, in late December 2015, the European Parliament, Council and Commission agreed a General Data Protection Regulation and a directive on network and information security. Industry representatives, however, view European harmonisation more critically. They consider the ECJ decisions and the Commission\u2019s legal initiatives to be \u201cusing politics for a digital industrial policy\u201d and to be protectionist.</p>\n<p>The importance of private actors can also be seen in the fact that they run much critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, banks, energy concerns, and waterworks. Additionally, private actors often have the relevant knowledge for gauging threat levels and developing tools to defend against threats. Only banks know how often they are attacked, and without information from industrial companies about espionage, no intelligence service can take meaningful countermeasures.

The directive is intended to make IT more secure for operators of critical infrastructure and large online service providers, and will oblige affected companies to report any security and data protection events or IT attacks. These requirements are intended for all operators and providers of \u201cessential services\u201d, such as in energy, water supply, transport, finance, health and the Internet.

The German Federal Government used the long negotiation period from 2013 to 2015 to reach a solution nationally with its industry, before the EU agreed on the topic. The German Parliament passed its IT security law in July 2015, and thus introduced reporting obligations for serious cyber attacks and minimum standards for protecting critical infrastructure earlier than the EU.</p>\n    \n    <p>However, close cooperation between state authorities and private companies working in the area of critical-infrastructure security is not without risks. It is especially questionable whether the private sector can self-regulate if state actors allow themselves to become dependent on the interests of individual private actors to the point where they are barely able to act meaningfully without them. This dependency becomes the more dangerous, the more tightly these companies monopolise the relevant knowledge.

Germany, the EU and NATO have so far been pursuing a defensive cyberstrategy in these areas. This differentiates Germany from individual EU and NATO partners such as France, Great Britain, the Netherlands and the US, which bank on deterrence through threats of retaliation and on surveillance and control technologies. Disastrous decisions on retaliation and escalation based on misinterpretations could potentially result from this, since technical, political and legal reasons make it almost impossible to identify attackers. For these reasons, cyberinsecurity is growing within the international community. States are users of ICTs; they have to protect their citizens and data; and at the same time they have to regulate the digital sector, which is largely dominated by private companies. Creating universally secure components is considered extremely difficult, but where software is used by the state, transparency, testing and analysis are indispensable. One can deduce from this state of affairs which are the most important areas of an international cybersecurity policy: human-rights and data protection policy; Internet Governance, fighting cybercrime; and developing international norms. These five areas overlap both conceptually and in terms of content. Unsurprisingly, problems arise from this, such as a conflictual coordination of responsibilities, or inconsistencies and a lack of coherence in the policies which are supposed to deal with challenges in cyberspace. In all of these areas, due diligence means taking to heart the three demands of European cooperation, inclusiveness and civilian response.</p>\n\n<h2>Human Rights and Data Protection</h2>\n<p>Civil liberties on the Internet are constitutive of liberal democracies. However, it is also clear \u2013 at the very latest since the revelations made by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013 \u2013 that even western secret services carry out passive surveillance on a massive scale and, moreover, that they knowingly infiltrate and compromise computer systems. Organisations such as Freedom House with its annual study Freedom on the Net, Reporters without Borders, or activists for free software remind us again and again that governments and globally active IT corporations do not provide continual barrier-free Internet access across the world. These organisations claim, for instance, that the Facebook project Internet.org only gives access to Facebook. Freedom activists demand that Internet access should be a basic human right; at the UN, however, discussions on this topic are far from reaching a conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>In a July 2012 resolution, the UN Human Rights Council emphasised that human rights are valid in the same way online as they are offline. In November 2013, as part of a German-Brazilian initiative, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on privacy in the digital age, in which, among other things, it proscribes mass surveillance as illegal and undemocratic. In May 2015, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, called for the encryption of private communications to be made a standard. In early July of the same year, the UN Human Rights Council created the post of UN special rapporteur on privacy and appointed Joseph Cannataci of Malta.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1264, "completion_tokens": 660, "total_tokens": 1924}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The mission of the UN\u2019s new special rapporteur is to report on this equilibrium as it relates to privacy.</p>\n  \n  <p>The European experience has taught us that, in the long term, integrated economic areas also need integrated domestic and justice policies. The Lisbon Treaty gives great weight to the realisation of an \u201carea of freedom, security and justice\u201d. Basic rights were strengthened by a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was legally binding on the EU and came into force at the same time as the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, and by the obligation on the EU to ratify the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. What holds true for the single market also holds true for the transatlantic economic area. Where the transfer of economic data is concerned, the EU and USA have agreed to finalise a so-called Privacy Shield. Current negotiations concern a transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal prosecution, which might include steps towards harmonising criminal offences and a reciprocal hand-over of relevant data and information. Intensive cooperation among law-enforcement agencies is urgently needed to fight cybercrime. Online sources of funds for terrorism, such as digital financial services providers, can only be removed if the US and Europe cooperate closely on information sharing. A strengthened Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP), the umbrella agreement on data protection for law-enforcement purposes and modernised mutual legal assistance agreements (MLAs) are relevant steps forward for a constructive cooperation. Fighting terrorism also requires comprehensive cooperation between the security services (as for instance between the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d), which must, however, be subject to more stringent parliamentary controls.

The trialogue between representatives of the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union led to an agreement in December 2015 on a package of reforms for data protection in the shape of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which replaced the EU\u2019s data protection directive of 1995. The new Regulation will have to be transposed directly into national law as of 2018. The GDPR reform package includes a directive that stipulates a harmonised legal framework for rules on data processing by the police and judicial authorities of the EU member states. The GDPR will outlaw the passing-on of data gathered in the EU for commercial or other uses to courts or authorities of third states. The best-known examples of this practice are the large digital-service providers such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, which store the data of European clients in the US using data protection provisions that violate European law. Where there are grave violations of the data protection law, data protection authorities will in future be able to impose drastic fines on companies. Such authorities are playing an ever more important role as instances for complaints and control because they verify how personal data are handled and can initiate sanctions. Their independence therefore needs to be reinforced and the influence of private-sector companies on them needs to be restricted.

In the field of prevention, the Federal Government started an inter-departmental research programme on improving security in cyberspace in March 2015.

States should only intervene in a regulatory capacity when self-regulation can no longer guarantee democratic legitimacy, effectiveness, rule of law and transparency. Multilateral cooperation comes into play whenever concerns of states with less developed Internet capacities are to be integrated into Internet Governance. In Germany, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy will be in overall control of the future of Internet Governance and Industrie 4.0. A series of reforms of Internet Governance can be inferred from the due diligence standard:</p>\n    \n    <p>European Coordination The German Federal Government should coordinate its national position with its EU partners and other states, especially the OECD, to create the preconditions for asserting its views internationally at the UN (as it did, most recently, at the WSIS follow-up conference in December 2015). It is pointless to stand alone, for the simple reason that Germany does not have sufficient negotiating power in the multilateral or Internet Governance fora. The EU position was set in June 2011 when the European Commission declared that the EU\u2019s aim was to create \u201ca single, un-fragmented network, subject to the same laws and norms that apply in other areas of our day-to-day lives\u201d. The EU and Germany are in favour of a leading role for the Internet Governance Forum, whose term was extended by another five years at the UN summit in December 2015. This is intended to prevent intergovernmental influence from being exerted to the disadvantage of the multi-stakeholder approach, and to \u201cinternationalise\u201d bodies and functions such as ICANN and IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). By this, the EU means engaging in an inclusive dialogue with developing, emerging and industrialised countries in terms of innovative best practices, with the goal of ensuring Internet access even in rural areas (capacity-building). With the help of Internet Governance, it wants to continually improve ICT even in less developed regions and parts of the world.</p>\n    \n    <p>Inclusiveness Inclusiveness and legitimacy are highly controversial in global Internet Governance. However, civil-society interest groups and members of parliament ought to be involved in the setting of global Internet norms, so that decisions are not only taken by technical bodies such as the Internet Architecture Board. Inclusiveness is the only guarantee that the necessary professional competence will be made available and that social acceptance for the norm-setting processes will be generated. Beyond this, IANA\u2019s function of assigning top-level domains \u2013 meaning the highest level of name resolution, such as *.com or *.de \u2013 should be put on a footing acceptable to all. The multi-stakeholder process in Internet Governance has been extended for five years because the UN General Assembly decided in late 2015 that the IGF should continue its activities. The security issues of individual governments, such as Russia or Saudi-Arabia, are inevitably playing an ever greater role in questions of Internet administration.</p>\n    \n    <p>Civilian Response The preconditions for civilising digital communications are confidentiality, integrity and reliability.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1281, "completion_tokens": 689, "total_tokens": 1970}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Even well-encrypted emails generate metadata, which yield a lot of information about their sender, receiver, subjects and time. Security services such as the NSA collect such data on a grand scale. Much work is being carried out on encryption technologies to make this task more difficult. Users themselves play a decisive role in civilising communications. They can exert pressure to help enforce a user-friendly, sophisticated and fully differentiated encryption. It therefore makes sense for the Internet Governance committees to discuss cybersecurity more and more often as well. It would be inadvisable, however, to securitise Internet Governance or to allow states to exert increasing influence over it, with the exception of state bodies wanting to comply with due diligence.

So far, the EU has limited itself to coordinating the effort to create \u201can open, secure and protected cyberspace\u201d by focusing on a) creating resilient IT structures, b) fighting cybercrime, c) developing defensive cyber capacities, d) promoting industrial and technological developments in cybersecurity, and e) developing international cyber diplomacy. The success and prospects of Europe\u2019s internal security depend on it acting at the national, European and international levels whilst making use of the technological possibilities of information exchange between these levels and giving that exchange legal protection.

It would not be appropriate to harmonise crimi-\n        nal offences using intergovernmental agreements of \n        individual state\u2019s regulations. Rather, what is needed \n        is a process that involves all EU states and orientates \n        itself on the due legislative processes of the EU. \n        As of yet, however, the EU does not have the author-\n        ity to harmonise criminal law. Its current legal and \n        political system still rests on criminal law applying \n        and operating within national borders. At the same \n        time, it is becoming more difficult to categorise access \n        rights because cloud services, for example, operate \n        beyond continent. The EU should nevertheless con-\n        centrate on the issue of criminal prosecution while \n        applying the \u201cEuropean agenda on security\u201d. There are \n        a number of further meaningful initiatives, such as \n        the European arrest warrant, the creation of a Euro-\n        pean prosecution service or the adoption of mutual \n        legal assistance agreements, including all relevant \n        transatlantic agreements. To disincentivise companies \n        from relocating their business abroad and thus cir-\n        cumventing due diligence obligations, the EU\u2019s data-\n        security standards (the NIS directive) should be brought \n        into line with those set in the US by the National Insti-\n        tute of Standards. Transatlantic cooperation has an \n        important role to play not only in public-private part-\n        nerships, but also at the official level, for instance in \n        the EU-US working group on fighting cybercrime.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Security agencies on the EU and national levels will \n        have to get used to the fact that the fight against \n        cybercrime can no longer dispense with the coopera-\n        tion of private actors. A clear separation between \n        private and public sector can hardly be upheld in this \n        area, because the companies that have been attacked \n        are frequently the only bodies that have the means of \n        resolving cyber attacks. Corporations like Microsoft \n        even obtain court orders authorising so-called hack-\n        backs: authorising them, in other words, to penetrate \n        the attackers\u2019 IT systems in turn, for instance to \n        destroy groups of automated malware, so-called bot-\n        nets. While it remains difficult to attribute cyber \n        attacks unequivocally \u2013 for instance, because of falsi-\n        fied invoices, sabotaged computer systems and pass-\n        word theft \u2013 perpetrators nonetheless leave digital \n        traces. Reconstruction and analysis \u2013 IT forensics \u2013 are \n        thus the pivot of criminal prosecution. The German \n        authorities, including the BKA and the state bureaux \n        of investigation, therefore back the action plan of the \n        European Police Office (Europol). Today, prosecut-\n        ing authorities also systematically look for dangers in \n        the IT system (threat hunting), instead of merely \n        reacting to attacks. Where such a hunt is successful, \n        attackers may be prevented from accessing the most \n        sensitive areas. However, this presupposes that data is \n        stored in such a way that it can be used in court. \n        Gathering evidence from large and complex data \n        banks takes time and requires extremely powerful \n        computers. Digital forensics face enormous challeng-\n        es. That is why authorities bank on support from \n        private IT forensic scientists to solve crimes. But \n        public-private cooperation on cybersecurity has its \n        weak points, among other reasons because industry \n        has so far not markedly got involved in fighting crime, \n        except for the BSI initiative Allianz f\u00fcr Cyber-\n        Sicherheit and for CERT exchanges. The Global Player \n        Initiative is a network founded back in 2006, in which \n        the BKA and (currently) 62 large enterprises partici-\n        pate. Overall, the BKA cooperates with about 630 \n        companies. Frequently, this exchange of information is \n        still more of a one-way street, because small and \n        medium enterprises in particular do not have the \n        capacities for taking far-reaching IT-security measures. \n        In Germany, operators of critical infrastructure are \n        obliged to report cyber attacks and introduce \n        minimum security standards for their IT. However, \n        security issues concerning software products and \n        external cloud services have not yet been sufficiently \n        resolved. Binding security tests and an extension of \n        the manufacturer\u2019s liability are currently under inten-\n        sive discussion.\n    </p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1361, "completion_tokens": 981, "total_tokens": 2342}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The cyberexercises that are regularly coordinated by ENISA may not be spectacular, but they are important for building resilient IT structures in accordance with due diligence. EU-EFTA member states and 200 governmental organisations participated in the Cyber Europe 2014 exercise. The exercise was designed to test how to improve cooperation between states in coping with cybersecurity incidents in the whole of Europe; how the many parallel communications relations impact on generating an overview of the national and European situation; and what consequences a comprehensive European cybercrisis might have for the member states\u2019 press and PR activities. At the operative level, the continuous cooperation of the IT emergency teams with other CERTs is indispensable. The BSI, for instance, is a member of the European Government CERTs Group (EGC), an informal group at the European level, and of the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), an international coalition of about 200 state and private CERTS.</p>\n\n    <h3>Cyberdefence</h3>\n    <p>The NATO centre for repelling cyber attacks, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE), is financed by 11 member states of the Alliance, but is not part of its command structure. In the Tallin Manual, which includes the work of German academics, the Centre presented proposals for codifying the right to war (ius ad bellum) and the law of war (ius in bello) for cyberspace. Its authors also attempted to elaborate how due diligence might be best served in cyberspace. For example, the Tallinn Manual states that \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.\u201d In line with its constitutional obligation to defend the Alliance, the German military also primarily has defensive cybercapabilities, meaning that it is geared for cyberdefence. Cyberdefence includes measures for repelling threats not just against individual persons or enterprises but also against the state and its social foundations. The German armed forces view themselves as the central instance for repelling external dangers in cyberspace as well. According to Germany\u2019s security strategy, IT systems in military use and the German share of cyberspace are also part of cyberdefence. For some time now, it has been clear not only that digital conflicts are increasingly carried out in cyberspace, but also that military deployments are occurring below the threshold of armed conflict and that non-state actors are involved. The German Federal Government therefore explicitly points out that military actors may also be responsible for cyber attacks.</p>\n\n    <h3>European Cooperation</h3>\n    <p>Germany\u2019s cyberdefence policy should push for European and Atlantic cooperation early on, always with the aim of enforcing the guiding principle of due diligence. National measures intended to check and increase the quality of the components and key technologies in use should be based on the clarification and exchange of information within the EU, and between the EU and NATO. In December 2013, the European Council announced that it would intensify EU-NATO cooperation. In November 2014, it adopted the Cyber Defence Policy Framework.

As a result, at its summit in Wales in June 2014, the Alliance adopted its Enhanced Cyber Defence Strategy, with the aim of building resilient ICT-structures in the military field. Alongside consultation and support processes, there will also be joint exercises, for instance on handling cyber attacks. Every year, NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which has also been entrusted with operative IT security and network surveillance, organises its three-day Cyber Coalition. The NCIRC Coordination Centre is responsible for coordinating with member states and partner organisations for this event, such as the EU, OSCE or International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Cooperation between NATO and the EU-CERT has also been decided. European cooperation in cyberdefence comprises research as well as industry as a \u201cfirst line of defence\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Armed forces may only be deployed in cyberspace under the same conditions of constitutional law that apply to conventional military capabilities. In Germany, this concerns primarily Art 87a GG and Art 24 para 2 GG. If these preconditions are met, it is legally possible to take damaging (counter-)measures against an attacker\u2019s IT systems, including information-gathering and reconnaissance. Furthermore, the German armed forces can use their own capacities to protect the whole state from IT attacks. The legal basis for this is Art 35 para 1 GG and regulations on the use of the armed forces to repel and cope with a particularly grave incident. However, each armed deployment of German military forces requires the assent of the German Parliament under a law known as the Parlamentsbeteiligungsgesetz. In developing a German cyber-defence policy, it is therefore advisable to reflect early on about involving the Federal Parliament. The legal precondition of parliamentary approval that exists in Germany is a major asset that must not carelessly be sacrificed to technological progress. In this context, there needs to be a debate on parliamentary approval after the fact, which was legitimised by the Federal Constitutional Court in its so-called Nafurah decision in the summer of 2015. This dealt with the possibility of informing the German Parliament only in retrospect in cases where there is \u201cGefahrenverzug\u201d, meaning looming danger.</p>\n\n<p>In times of peace, due diligence in cyberdefence means pursuing primarily civilian approaches to the preventative and reactive protection of one\u2019s IT systems and infrastructure.

Thus, several battalions with different tasks in electronic warfare report to the strategic reconnaissance commando (KSA). During the elaboration of the 2016 White Paper, defence minister von der Leyen announced that the German armed forces were establishing a cyberspace and information-space division (CIR). It is certain that cyberspace, as the fifth operational domain alongside land, air, sea and space, will have an impact on the German military\u2019s deployability. To avoid a digital arms race, cyberdefence needs to focus above all on building resilient structures. However, improved defensive capacities are not enough. It is also essential to develop high-security IT in close collaboration with other EU states and allies, and to curb the worldwide \u201cblack market\u201d for vulnerabilities in IT systems, and especially zero-day markets.</p>\n    <p>However, even within the German armed forces there are concerns that the new division (CIR) could develop in ways that are similar to the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), which is not subject to any parliamentary oversight and works closely with the NSA. There are concerns that the activities of the CIR cannot be reconciled with the traditional understanding of the \u201ccitizen in uniform\u201d. The manner in which the capabilities to be created are strategically and operationally integrated into the German armed forces will therefore be decisive.</p>\n    <p>Developing international norms is a central part of Germany\u2019s international cyber policy. Germany exports technological products worldwide and receives primary products from almost all of the world\u2019s countries. However, since adjusting to standards always has its costs, it is very much in Germany\u2019s interests wherever possible to turn its own standards into the international norm. For this, its international cyber policy acts in three areas. Its first goal is to reach agreements with third parties on confidence and security-building measures. Its second aims is to conclude agreements that set international standards for the approval of hardware and software and define norms for responsible conduct by states. Its third target is applying international law in cyberspace.</p>\n    <p>For the cyberdefence policy to enforce due diligence in cyberspace, the EU needs to be placed in a position where it can engage more closely in developing international norms. In April 2015, the EU\u2019s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, and the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders emphatically pointed out the necessity of taking states up on their promise for their behaviour in cyberspace.

Germany is a prominent representative at all of these international debates. 20 states, including five EU member states, took part in the fourth round of the negotiations of governmental experts on information security (UN GGE).151 The final reports of the expert rounds were adopted by the UN General Assembly. However, the concrete application of international law to cyberspace remains a point of contention. Selected EU states are engaging on the UN level and represent the EU. There is closer agreement between Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d as well as bilaterally with the US and Israel in the group of likeminded western states (which alongside Germany, Spain, France and Great Britain also comprises Colombia, Israel, Japan, South Korea and the US). A fifth round of GGE negotiations is scheduled to start in 2016. The EU states involved should focus their energies on giving EU concerns more emphasis in the GGE in future, as stipulated in the Council\u2019s conclusions on cyberdiplomacy.152 In this, the EU needs to speak \u201cwith one voice\u201d, because a divided EU would find it very difficult to assert its interests over those of the US, Russia or China.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It is part of the tasks of the German and EU international cyber policy and cyberdefence policy to prevent a digital arms race by prioritising civilian approaches and confidence-building measures. On the occasion of its OSCE presidency in 2016, Germany intends to adopt a new package of confidence- and security-building measures that particularly integrates science and the civil society.153 Because of its experience in arms control and confidence-building that span opposing blocs, the German OSCE chairmanship is developing CSBMs in all three areas for cyberspace. The OSCE is a regional approach that complements and supplements the work of the GGE. It is expected to safeguard the mutual commitment that no computer systems or cyberinfrastructure on the territories of its member states will be used for attacks on other states. But provisions must also not be misused for restricting the freedom of the Internet. In partnership with science and companies, the OSCE intends to promote the development of protective measures that are both technical and regulatory to make critical infrastructure in OSCE states more resilient. Cybersecurity can only be guaranteed if stakeholders do so in coordination with national governments and the EU, and involve as many concerned parties as possible.154 The EU approach of \u201cinclusive multi-stakeholderism\u201d is increasingly becoming the trademark of international cyber policy and digital diplomacy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The development of international norms raises political questions with direct relevance for the global assertion of human rights and for national security. Since June 2013, Germany has been a member of the Freedom Online Coalition, a multi-stakeholder platform that now comprises 28 countries and campaigns for liberties in cyberspace.155 Due diligence also applies to German companies in the information, communications and Internet economy. They must therefore ensure that their exports are not used by authoritarian regimes to abuse civil liberties on the Internet.

These approaches could be continued, at least on the regional level, using the EU\u2019s dual-use regulation.

As a European middle-size power, Germany will only be able to find this new focus in a perspective that is in keeping with its integration in European Union, democratic values and firm commitment to civilian forms of politics. The due diligence norm lends itself to that. It expresses the cooperative and global character of a good international cyber and cybersecurity policy, without concealing its domestic foundations. Modern (cyber) foreign and security policies are always also domestic policies.</p>\n<p>Germanys has started to implement the due diligence principle in its cyber policy. The fundamental idea of due diligence is that states bear responsibility for threats that emanate from their territory and must do everything in their power in cooperation with other EU states and allies to prevent damage to third parties. Developments in German cybersecurity structures are already taking great strides in this direction. They are at least partly coordinated with the EU and bring together a great number of interested parties. In digital industrial policy cooperation between state and private actors with the aim of pooling professional expertise is needed to give due diligence greater weight. In both areas, there is a marked precedence of civilian over military approaches.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, a series of starting-points remain for improving Germany\u2019s International and European cyber policy and cyberdefence policy:</p>\n<p>First: The norm of due diligence must be lastingly enforced in international relations. For the time being, it merely has the status of a controversial legal standard and is not included as a binding regulation in bilateral and multilateral agreements. In the final report of the fourth round of UN GGE negotiations, the represented states commit to stopping attacks that emanate from their territories and also commit to not deliberately damaging other countries\u2019 critical infrastructure or IT emergency teams. The agreement between the US and China on jointly fighting cybercrime and on outlawing industrial espionage is also a promising step that can serve as a model for bilateral agreements between other countries. Here, it will be important to work politically towards a general recognition of due diligence and also to create the necessary institutional structures in the medium term to guarantee that the norm is being applied effectively. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs plays a leading role in coordinating an international cyber policy and cyberdefence policy at the EU level. It is the only department that rises above the sectional perspectives of individual policy areas; and as a cross-ministerial responsibility.</p>\n<p>Germany\u2019s international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy should be formulated even more strongly inside EU structures. Only because of the European single market is Germany able to act with the necessary vigour on the international stage. A promising starting-point is the Friends of the Presidency Group (FoP) on Cyber Issues. It was created in 2013 to support the implementation of the EU cybersecurity strategy. In FoP, the various cyber topics are coordinated horizontally at the EU level. While the working group has so far only been set up for three years at a time, it has already become the most important hub for coordinating national interests in EU cyber policy.</p>\n<p>Second: Only a close cooperation between the EU and USA is the adequate framework for drafting international norms. Where they agree, they have enough political influence to tilt the scales towards a more effective enforcement of due diligence. What is urgently needed now is a transatlantic initiative on the attribution problem, meaning the difficulty of unequivocally attributing cyber attacks to an actor. States frequently use this difficulty as a way out of due diligence by shifting the blame onto third parties. In line with the TTIP negotiations, both an economic data transfer and a bilateral agreement on mutual legal assistance need to be agreed on. The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation should quickly be complemented by Privacy Shield agreed by the EU and the US that meets the legal criteria formulated by the ECJ. Implementation of the Privacy Shield should take into account the legal reservations expressed in the ECJ\u2019s decision of October 2015. This is the only basis for giving companies and consumers the necessary legal certainty. With its General Data Protection Regulation, the EU has defused the problem of European citizens\u2019 data being stored and evaluated according to US law.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1143, "completion_tokens": 870, "total_tokens": 2013}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

In practice, global companies now store any data of European citizens in Europe to prevent clashing with EU law. With this decision, the EU will apply its own law on others\u2019 sovereign territory. Extra-territorial effects of national law contradict the principle of due diligence obligations. States such as the US and China are likely to have fewer scruples in future about passing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. This could result in a collision course for different national legal systems, which would encourage the fragmentation of the global economic space and the Internet. The Privacy Shield for data transfer and the transatlantic agreement on data protection in criminal cases are therefore vital steps in the effort to stop this process.</p>\n\n<p>Third: Due diligence obligations should be imposed on those states which have been attacked, on whose territory the servers are located, or over whose data cables attacks are carried out. The density of these obligations should depend on the ability of the states in questions to exert influence and on their ICT capacities. It also seems sensible to strengthen the substantive criminal law and use it for deterrence. Moreover, IT forensics in particular should be expanded so that perpetrators of cyber attacks become easier to identify. Non-state actors should be called on to participate actively. Where companies are forced to break the law because of differences in national legal standards (for instance, on the one hand, a state\u2019s demand for information that must be complied with, and on the other hand, a prohibition on handing out data for data protection reasons), the states involved do not live up to the principle of the rule of law. Given the experience of European integration, it would be advisable to confer competences on a supranational jurisdiction along the lines of the European Court of Justice or courts of arbitration, so as to enforce due diligence better on this point. This would also reduce legal uncertainty for companies. On the other hand, it must be possible to force companies to make their software products more secure. At the very least, the criteria for transparency, testing and certification must be made more stringent at least on the EU level within ENISA.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: The growing complexity of IT-protected weapons systems and the high quality that detected cyber attacks now attain demand much cybersecurity know-how. Moreover, the defence industry needs to take data security into account at the design stage of any system architecture. It therefore stands to reason that manufacturers should be included in the further development and use of cyberdefence systems. However, this should be coordinated at the European level, approved by politically independent or parliamentary decisions, and remain committed to an exclusively defensive military logic. Otherwise, such conduct would run counter to due diligence and would also break with the tradition of military restraint in foreign and security policy. The required inclusiveness in all issues of international cyber policy and cybersecurity policy also means that the German Federal Parliament must be duly involved. Should the German armed forces be empowered to use digital attacks as part of their cyberdefence, the political change of course that might be required for this would need to be debated in Parliament. A robust security policy presupposes social resilience, which can only be created through public debate. This also includes carrying out a reality check on the parliamentary-approval requirement for cyber operations by the German armed forces. It will be the Parliament\u2019s task to create effective structures for parliamentary oversight.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 981, "completion_tokens": 710, "total_tokens": 1691}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Having this in mind I will thus examine successively the existence of an eventual obligation to enact legislation and domestic norms to forbid and condemn cyber acts against other States and the existence of an obligation of all States to secure their own cyber infrastructure (6).

A State does not incur responsibility simply because the desired result is not achieved; responsibility is however incurred if the State manifestly failed to take all measures to prevent genocide which were within its power, and which might have contributed to preventing the genocide.

According to Rule 5 of the Tallinn Manual, \u201c[a] State shall not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely affect other States.\u201d This duty of cyber diligence applies to all cyber activities whether they are of \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d intensity, and whether these cyber operations are launched from the territory of a State or just routed by the territory of a State. Indeed, despite the hesitation of some experts, there is no legal reason to consider that transit States do not have a duty of diligence and thus could escape their own obligations in this respect. For example, if a State knows that a terrorist group is about to cross its territory to attack a third State, the duty to act and to prevent exists.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 947, "completion_tokens": 364, "total_tokens": 1311}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

This being said, we should not underestimate the extraordinary challenges created by the nature of the operations and a messy cyberspace. In several cases it would be impossible to prove that there was knowledge of these actions in a transit State. And, even if such knowledge were to exist, the available time for an appropriate reaction is of critical importance. Indeed, as the ICJ recognised in the Corfu Channel case the availability of enough time in order to notify third States and to react is very important in order to assess if a State failed in relation to its due diligence obligation. With regard to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, it is therefore unlikely that any State of transit could be held accountable for violating the due diligence principle. On the other hand if a cyber-attack is launched using public or private computers located in the transit State and the latter had or ought to have had the knowledge and the means to avert the situation the outcome could be different.</p>\n<p>Knowledge as a Decisive Element of the Due Diligence Principle Knowledge is the first decisive element of due diligence. In the Hostages case, the ICJ engaged Iran\u2019s responsibility after concluding that \u201cthe Iranian authorities (b) were fully aware \u2026 of the urgent need for action on their part; (c) had the means at their disposal to perform their obligations; (d) completely failed to comply with these obligations\u201d.

This is why in Corfu the ICJ stated that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory and waters that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known\u201d what was happening. In a similar way the European Court of Human Rights observed, in its famous Osman v. United Kingdom case concerning the right to life, that: [f]or the Court, and bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.

Due to the fact that States exercise exclusive territorial control within their frontiers, this proof could become a real probatio diabolica for victims. Indeed, the victims of a breach of international law could be unable to furnish direct proof of facts to demonstrate the existence of knowledge.

In Corfu Channel the Court said that a State on whose territory an act contrary to international law has occurred \u201cmay be called upon to give an explanation [and] cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.\u201d This conclusion is directly linked to the duties related to the exclusive control exercised by States over their territory. In a similar way the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) or the Human Rights Committee constantly accept the idea of constructive knowledge as part of the \u201cpositive obligations\u201d of States in the field of Human Rights. As the ECHR said in Osman v. United Kingdom: [W]here there is an allegation that the authorities have violated their positive obligation \u2026 , it must be established \u2026 that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to the nature of measures that States should adopt in order to be in a position to \u2018know\u2019 if illegal cyber acts which are hostile toward third States take place on their territory. Does due diligence imply an obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory? The answer to this question is positive because, as it will be seen later, due diligence implies not only an obligation to react but also to prevent. Vigilance and monitoring thus go hand in hand. In the Pulp Mills case the ICJ held that due diligence implied \u201cthe exercise of administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators, to safeguard the rights of the other party\u201d. The recent French White Book on Defence also presents monitoring as a cornerstone in the fight against cyber activities which are dangerous for the security of States. According to the French White Paper on Defence and National Security, \u201c[t]he new importance of cyber-threats calls for developing our intelligence activity and the corresponding technical expertise in this area. This effort should allow us to identify the origin of attacks, assess the offensive capabilities of potential adversaries and in this way counter their action.

Electronic surveillance programs such as Prism have given rise to heated debate and have been considered by some as being of an \u201calmost-Orwellian\u201d nature. It should be recalled, nonetheless, that the duty of due diligence can only authorise acts compatible with international law. In the Genocide case the ICJ warned that \u201cit is clear that every State may only act within the limits permitted by international law\u201d. The ECtHR and other human rights treaty bodies also constantly emphasise that the police must exercise \u201ctheir powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and bring offenders to justice.\u201d</p>\n    <p>It is thus clear that the \u201cknew or ought to have known\u201d criterion cannot legitimise violations of international human rights or other rules.

Indeed, the occurrence of harm is necessary to engage State responsibility for lack of due diligence.

This obligation to notify has been clearly stated, for example, by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case.</p>\n\n<p>The weakness of some States to exercise their responsibility in this field raises of course many questions. Even if due diligence does not imply right now an obligation to cooperate with the least developed countries, it is clear that if States want to secure their own infrastructure against misuse, they could greatly benefit in helping developing countries to upgrade their own capacity-building. In this sense Resolution 64/211 is an interesting one by \u201c[s]tressing the need for enhanced efforts to close the digital divide in order to achieve universal access to information and communications technologies and to protect critical information infrastructures by facilitating the transfer of information technology and capacity-building to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, in the areas of cybersecurity best practices and training.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>According to R. Ago, \u201c[t]o our knowledge, decisions of international tribunals have never affirmed, even indirectly or incidentally, that failure to adopt measures to prevent the occurrence of a possible event sufficed in itself \u2013 i.e., without the actual occurrence of such an event \u2013 to constitute a breach of the obligation incumbent on the State.\u201d See in this respect Heathcote, supra note 11, p. 311.</p>\n\n<p>International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, United Nations, 2001.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Court: \u201cthe only conclusion to be drawn would be that a general notification to the shipping of all States before the time of the explosions would have been difficult, perhaps even impossible.

If the obligation of termination of the illegal activity is not controversial in itself, the implementation and the exact scope of this obligation could raise some questions. Indeed, in order to stop a cyber-attack, States can use different tools that have, in some cases, more or less serious negative effects on third-parties countries and civilians.

But it is nonetheless necessary in order to avoid states acting in a disproportionate manner or using the principle of due diligence as a mere pretext in order to follow a hidden agenda. During the evaluation of the proportionality and the reasonableness of the reaction, one should take once again into account the fact that these measures do not violate international law and especially human rights law.

The state\u2019s lack of effective control over part of its territory raises multiple challenges for international law, which is traditionally based on the duties of the state that is presumed to have exclusive control over its sovereign territory. Once the territorial state loses effective control over part of its territory \u2013 for various reasons, such as an armed conflict or consent given by the state to have its territory administered by another subject of international law \u2013 various norms of international law that bind the state may become complicated to apply.</p>\n<p>* University of Pretoria, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the SARChI Professorship on International Constitutional Law (Professor Erika de Wet); Visiting scholar, Manchester International Law Centre, University of Manchester; antal.berkes@manchester.ac.uk (comments welcome).

This means that often several states control the same territory (such as through a multinational operation) or that the conduct of a non-state actor in directly controlling the territory is attributed to an outside state. Therefore, the above-mentioned legal lacuna can be filled by new, or newly interpreted rules applied to the subjects that are active in the area: solutions proposed include the human rights obligations of the subject controlling the territory under the de facto control theory, the acquired human rights doctrine, and the concurrent obligations of various actors (states, non-state actors) exercising powers in the given area.

Furthermore, these areas are characterised by major human rights violations not only in the physical space, but also in cyberspace. Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of opinion, due process and human dignity, in particular, have been restricted online by actors which control the territory.

While other related topics \u2013 such as human rights obligations of non-state armed groups and occupying states, the duties of states in cyberspace, and their responsibility for the cyber conduct of non-state actors \u2013 have been researched extensively in recent years, nothing has been written on the substantive obligations of the territorial state in the cyberspace of an area out of governmental control.

The article proceeds as follows. The following section (Section 2) demonstrates the challenges that loss of territorial control by the state poses for human rights in cyberspace. It will show that the absence of control over the physical space is closely associated with online human rights violations, on the one hand, and the state\u2019s restricted (but not necessarily non-existent) control over the cyberspace, on the other. Section 3 confirms that notwithstanding the lack of its effective territorial control, the territorial state continues to be entitled to exercise its sovereignty over both the territory and the cyberspace. Section 4 discusses the logical consequence of sovereignty in IHRL, the territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction based on so-called due diligence, considered as a corollary duty of the rights arising from sovereignty.

The Republic of Moldova, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Cyprus, Iraq and Syria are all internationally recognised as sovereign over the disputed areas. Whether they have jurisdiction over the cyberspace in areas outside their effective control depends on the jurisdictional bases recognised in cyberspace.</p>\n    <p>Specifically in the context of online activities, the International Group of Experts in elaborating the Tallinn Manual 2.0 foresaw three major bases on which the state may exercise jurisdiction over cyber activities related to its territory. Rule 9 of the Manual allows the state to exercise jurisdiction over \u2018cyber infrastructure and persons engaged in cyber activities on its territory\u2019; \u2018cyber activities originating in, or completed on, its territory\u2019; and \u2018cyber activities having a substantial effect in its territory\u2019. As mentioned above, the Manual is intended to be an objective restatement of the lex lata and, as it will be shown, the relevant rule on territorial jurisdiction reflects the existing (positive) international law as accepted by states.</p>\n    <p>The first of these three bases for jurisdiction relies on the fact that the physical presence of a person or an object in the territory of the state provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of jurisdiction by that state. Since information and communication technologies require some physical infrastructure, states have jurisdiction over those objects and the persons engaged in cyber activities in their national territory.</p>\n    <p>For example, it is recognised that states may exercise regulatory authority over the telecommunications or internet service providers that physically control the data in the territory of the state. The territorial state\u2019s jurisdiction over cyber activities in areas outside its effective control is thus recognised when the persons engaging in cyber activities, or the cyber infrastructure (such as cable infrastructures, servers, computers, media production infrastructure or data storage facilities) are located in the area concerned.</p>\n    <p>The second basis for jurisdiction \u2013 cyber activities initiated or completed in the state\u2019s territory \u2013 relies on a principle of international law that has been recognised since the Lotus judgment, namely the subjective (activity originating in the state\u2019s territory) and objective (activity completed in the state\u2019s territory) territorial jurisdiction.

While online activities might cross over the jurisdiction of many states, it might be difficult to establish where a cyber activity started and ended.

Under \u2018objective jurisdiction\u2019, the cyber activity originates abroad, but is completed in the area concerned and the territorial state would be entitled, for instance, to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the perpetrators of the cybercrime by way of mutual legal assistance. Under \u2018subjective territorial jurisdiction\u2019, the state can exercise jurisdiction over any cyber activity originating from the area outside its effective control, such as online recruitment of terrorist fighters or hate speech diffused from the area concerned. Such cyber activities might result in the violation of human rights of victims in the same area, in the government-controlled area, or even in another state.</p>\n\n<p>The third jurisdictional basis proposed by the Tallinn Manual relies on the \u2018effects doctrine\u2019, a jurisdictional link accepted to reflect customary international law: where an activity does not emanate from or end in the state\u2019s territory but has effects therein, the state has jurisdiction. While certain domestic courts have applied the effects doctrine to cyberspace, some scholars contest its applicability as it may lead to assertions of jurisdiction in virtually every state by virtue of the accessibility of websites in all countries. The majority doctrine and the International Group of Experts accept its applicability to cyberspace if states use it reasonably, setting a higher threshold of a genuine link between the state and the cyber activity than is applied in the offline world. Accordingly, the territorial state will have jurisdiction over cyber activities that have a substantial effect on the given area, such as the diffusion of online propaganda addressed to the population of the area in their language from abroad.

While the state has obligations to respect and protect human rights in the cyberspace, it is not clear to what extent it has the same obligations in an area outside its effective control. The two spaces, the online and the physical space, are not completely unrelated, as is shown by the bases of territorial jurisdiction referred to above. In other words, in order to examine how far a state has obligations under IHRL in cyberspace in an area outside its effective control (discussed in Section 5), the preliminary question of how far IHRL applies \u2013 through the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u2013 to the physical offline space in that area must be clarified.</p>\n<p>\u2018Jurisdiction\u2019 in IHRL has an entirely different meaning from that of general international law: it is the main criterion for the applicability of international human rights treaties, the nexus between the state and the individual\u2019s human rights \u2013 that is, the factual control, power or authority that the state exercises over a given individual, territory or situation.

States are heavily dependent on the use of cyberspace. As cyberspace becomes a more important part of everyday life, there is an increasing need for regulation in that area. Cyberattacks and kinetic attacks can, at times, have similar consequences, for example harm to life, bodily harm, and destruction of property. The increase in cyber operations targeting States\u2019 administrations, the economic sector and critical infrastructure is one of \u201cthe most pressing and potentially dangerous\u201d threats for national and international security. While these cyber operations fall beneath the threshold of an armed attack, they can have a damaging impact. This raises issues about the obligations of States in this area and how international law can deal with this new threat. Already, efforts to regulate cyberspace can be seen in both regional and international contexts, especially on the area of cyber security.</p>\n    <p>Cyberspace enjoys some unique features which are not inherent in physical territory. First of all, cyberspace has a borderless character. Secondly, actors in cyberspace have a significant level of anonymity. Finally, cyberspace is easily accessible for many actors. All of these qualities of cyberspace amount to a thriving environment for non-State actors. Because of the special character of cyberspace, it has been under a lot of dispute whether international law applies in cyberspace or not.</p>\n    <p>For example, Barlow expressed in 1996 that legal concepts do not apply to cyberspace and that it \u201cdoes not lie within [governments\u2019] borders\u201d. These arguments assume that cyberspace is different from other spaces in that it is not territorial and that it is borderless. However, the consequences of having no rules in cyberspace would be that cyberspace becomes a \u201clawless land\u201d. It would be a legal void, where all kinds of actions.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 706, "completion_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 1135}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

In order to maintain peace and security, which is essential for international law, regulation is highly necessary.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        What most authors conclude is that it is no longer disputed that cyberspace is subject to international law. There is nothing that would exclude cyber operations from the application of international law. Instead, the discussions have now shifted to how international law should be applied in cyberspace. It is the scope and the content of international law which has obtained different reactions and remains unsettled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        International law and its applicability in cyberspace have been discussed in different fora. For example, a number of prominent international lawyers attempted to facilitate the regulation of cyber operations by international law by developing the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations (Tallinn Manual 2.0). A Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) was established by the United Nations in 2004 to strengthen the security of global information and telecommunications systems. The UN GGE were successful in releasing two consensus reports (in 2013 and 2015), before failing to reaffirm the applicability of international law to cyberspace in 2017.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Customary law is slow to develop, while advancement in the field of cyberspace is happening quickly. One might say that public international law is struggling to keep up. As an example of the way international law is not adjusted to cyberspace, there is a traditional understanding of an armed attack which does not at the moment support cyberattacks from hackers or non-State actors to States. Considerable difficulties exist in applying international law to cyberspace.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        At the center of the discussion lies the issue of State responsibility. State responsibility generally requires that the unlawful act can be attributed to a State.

Therefore, it has been suggested that attribution is not prepared to deal with these cyber operations. However, there might be another option to attribution to ensure the responsibility of States. Rule 6 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 describes the due diligence principle and states that it is applicable to cyber operations. Due diligence is a principle in customary international law, developed through case law. The principle infers an obligation on States to not allow knowingly their territories to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States. One of the consequences of the rule being applicable to cyber operations is that the State being targeted with the attack may be able to use countermeasures to stop the attack. It is therefore important for States to know whether this rule applies in cyberspace or not, and, if it does, to what extent.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this study is to examine whether the obligation of States to not allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States applies to activities conducted in cyberspace. In order to do this, the due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0., will be assessed.</p>\n\n<p>Due diligence is a rule concerned with State responsibility. Therefore, individual criminal responsibility will not be of interest in the study. Neither will the responsibility of international organizations. Attribution, which is essential for the determination of State responsibility, but not relevant for the due diligence principle, will be discussed only in order to understand the problems of State responsibility relating to cyberspace. Jus ad bellum and jus in bello will not be covered here. The due diligence principle applies both for peaceful cyber operations and for cyber operations which amount to the use of force by States and it is therefore not of interest in this study to discuss the rules about use of force. Furthermore, issues relating to self-defense are outside the scope of the study since self-defense refers to the right of a State to use force in response to an armed attack. However, countermeasures will be addressed because they may be allowed.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 687, "completion_tokens": 435, "total_tokens": 1122}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It is generally held that cyberspace is \u201cnot a physical place\u201d and that one of its characterizing features include anonymity. It has been compared to the high seas, international airspace and outer space, because it is sort of a \u201cglobal common\u201d. However, at the same time, cyberspace would not exist without certain physical components. The physical layer consists of equipment (e.g. computers, integrated circuits, cables, communications infrastructure) which is generally located on the territory of a State. Cyber infrastructure is defined by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 as \u201c[t]he communications, storage, and computing devices upon which information systems are built and operate\u201d. So while cyberspace in itself may be correctly referred to as res communis omnium, that is not true if one looks at the whole picture of cyberspace. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressed this more clearly, by stating that the view that cyberspace is a res communis omnium may be useful in other contexts, but not in the legal one. The International Group of Experts further held that cyber acts \u201coccur on territory and involve objects, or are conducted by persons or entities, over which States may exercise their sovereign prerogatives\u201d.

There is no commonly held definition of the term, but one definition is that ICTs are \u201c[a]ny information technology, equipment, or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that processes, transmits, receives, or interchanges data or information\u201d. A few examples of this are the internet, mobile communications devices, wireless networks, and other communication technologies. ICT devices can be both the source of a misuse or the target of such.</p>\n<h2>2.2 What is a cyber operation?</h2>\n<p>The due diligence rule in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 applies for all cyber operations. According to the manual, cyber operations are a kind of cyber activity. A cyber activity is defined as \u201c[a]ny activity that involves the use of cyber infrastructure or employs means to affect the operation of such infrastructure\u201d. Cyber operations are further defined as \u201cemployment of cyber capabilities to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace\u201d. Perhaps the most commonly referred to cyber operations are cyber attacks. A cyber attack is defined in Rule 92 in the manual as a \u201ccyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects\u201d. According to Tsagourias, the term cyber attack is \u201cused to describe a variety of harmful activities taking place in the cyberspace\u201d. The NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions provides a definition of one type of cyber attacks, namely computer network attacks (CAN). These sorts of attacks are actions \u201ctaken to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in a computer and/or computer.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 767, "completion_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 1164}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

A mere intrusion into a computer system is not included in the term cyber attack. Rather, it is to be considered as cyber espionage, which is not prohibited under public international law. However, Voitasec explains that currently there is no widely recognized definition of cyber attacks. Neither is there a legal definition of the term cyber operation. In other words, it is not entirely established what acts are included in the aforementioned terms. For the purposes of this study, however, it is not necessary to establish exactly the content of the terms cyber operations or cyber attacks. Since the due diligence principle as formulated in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is concerned with cyber operations, that term, which is unquestionably wider than the term cyber attack, will be used throughout the study.</p>\n\n<p>When discussing cyber operations and the due diligence principle, certain terms will be used. The target State refers to the State being targeted with the cyber operation, i.e. the State whose rights are being affected. The territorial State is the State in whose territory the cyber operation is being operated from or where the cyber infrastructure is located, i.e. the State that has the due diligence obligation. The author of the cyber operation means the individual or group which is conducting the cyber operation in question.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to point out that it is no longer only teenage hackers that are behind these cyber operations, but all from States and criminal or terrorist organizations to individuals with ideological motives. Cyber operations can be used to \u201cdelete, alter, or corrupt software and data resident in computers\u201d which consequently could affect physical infrastructures which are operated by computers. Roscini gives examples of potential consequences of malicious cyber operations: a cyber operation could go as far as to disable power generators, cut off the military command, control, and communication systems, cause trains to derail and aeroplanes to crash, nuclear reactors to melt down, pipelines to explode, weapons to malfunction, banking systems to cripple.</p>\n\n<p>Cyber threats are a concern for the international community and therefore it is important to know whether international law applies in cyberspace.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 676, "completion_tokens": 443, "total_tokens": 1119}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

Cyberspace is borderless, actors in cyberspace can be significantly anonymous, and it is easily accessible for many actors, including non-State actors. Because of the special character of cyberspace, there has been discussions in the legal doctrine whether public international law applies to cyberspace or not. While one view is that cyberspace is not within any borders, and therefore it cannot be subjected to legal concepts, the most generally held view is that international law is in fact applicable to cyberspace. If nothing else, if there were no rules applicable to cyberspace, cyberspace would become a lawless land. This would mean that non-State actors and State actors alike could perform all sorts of acts without legal consequences. Regulation is necessary in order to prevent a legal void, and to ensure the maintaining of peace and security.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, it was highlighted in Chapter 2.1 that cyber operations do not only occur in cyberspace. They are highly associated with territory, since either the authors behind the cyber operation, or the technology used, are located on the territory of one or more States. Therefore, it is only reasonable that the territorial States must apply international law as usual.</p>\n    <p>The introduction of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 concludes that existing international law applies to cyber operations and that this is a view most States agreed on, and which has been acknowledged by NATO and the UN GGE.

State responsibility is a central principle of public international law. It rests on the foundation that States are sovereign and equal. The principle stipulates that international responsibility occurs between two States, when one State commits an internationally unlawful act against the other State. State responsibility attempts to answer three questions, namely, if there has been a breach of an international obligation by a State, what the consequences are for such a breach, and who may seek reparation or respond to the breach.</p>\n    <p>The International Law Commission adopted draft articles on State responsibility on 9 August 2001 (the ILC Articles on State Responsibility). According to Shaw, the Draft Articles are considered to have a particular weight to them, since the General Assembly in a resolution annexed the text of the articles and commended them to governments, which is an unusual procedure.

There has been a debate in the legal literature whether some kind of fault is required or whether it is an \u201cobjective responsibility\u201d. Case law generally support the latter. However, Crawford & Olleson holds that whether fault is necessary depends on if the relevant primary obligation includes it at a necessary condition. The same could be said about the question of whether some kind of harm or damage is necessary. The Rainbow Warrior case established that \u201cdamage\u201d is generally not a requirement determining an internationally wrongful act.</p>\n<p>According to Article 42 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, a State is entitled as an injured State to invoke the responsibility of another State if the obligation breached is owed to that State individually or to a group of States, including that State, or the international community as a whole. Furthermore, the breach of the obligation must specifically affect the injured State or is of such a character as radically to change the position of all the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens": 380, "total_tokens": 1070}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

As such, they cannot act themselves. Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility declares that in order for an act or omission to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct in question must be attributable to the State. This element of State responsibility is necessary since the State, as a single entity, is not the one acting. Instead, it is a State organ or a person or a group which acts on behalf of the State. A State is normally only responsible for the acts of its organs or officials. The rules of attribution, which are included in Chapter II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, aim to establish a connection between these agents and the State itself.</p>\n    \n    <p>There are three general attribution standards. Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states that the conduct of an organ or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if acting in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.</p>\n    \n    <p>The second standard according to Article 8 of the ILC articles on State Responsibility is that the conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered as an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ stated, regarding the level of control necessary, that \u201cit would in principle have to be proved that [the State in question] had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 791, "completion_tokens": 438, "total_tokens": 1229}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

This is not a complete examination of the rules of attribution, but it presents the foundation of attribution and explains the main ways of attributing acts. The main reason for introducing the rules of attribution in this study is to explain the difficulties in relation to cyber operations. This will be done in the next chapter.</p>\n    <p>3.4 The problems of attribution in cyberspace As has been explained in the previous chapter, attribution is one of the conditions for establishing the responsibility of States. However, with the particular features of internationally wrongful acts in cyberspace, it is not that simple. Cyber operations produce both technical and legal challenges to public international law. It has been described as being \u201cmore art than science\u201d. Attribution is an issue which is often discussed in the international legal doctrine, but it is still a highly underdeveloped part of international cyber law.</p>\n    <p>Attribution attempts to identify the source of the cyber operation, which is an important matter, for example in order to respond properly to the cyber operation. However, identifying the actor behind the cyber operation is just one of several issues of attribution in cyberspace. Chircop describes it as a three-level problem.</p>\n    <p>First, the computer or computers used in the cyber operation must be identified. This is not technically impossible, since every computer has an IP address which is unique to it. The IP address can in certain circumstances be used to obtain the exact position of the computer. However, the actor of the cyber operation may be able to mask the IP address so that it is not trackable. Not only that, but if the actor uses a network modification technique, it can make it seem as if the computer is in a different location to where it in fact is.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 649, "completion_tokens": 445, "total_tokens": 1094}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Attribution attempts to establish the connection between the State and an actor. Of course, even if the location of the computer was identified, this does not automatically mean that the person behind the act can be identified.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the last part of the problem is that, even if the computer location is established and the person operating the computer identified, there must be a sufficient legal nexus between the actor and the State. The ICJ stated in Bosnian Genocide that it had to find a \u201csufficiently direct and certain causal nexus between the wrongful act [\u2026] and the injury suffered\u201d. The wrongful act in the case was the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide.</p>\n\n<p>Tsagourias adds another issue to the ones described already. It is possible that the cyber operation is performed by multi-stage cyber attacks, which means that there are several computers at different locations (or even different jurisdictions) and that they are operated by different people. Naturally, this complicates matters even more. Moreover, cyber operations can emerge rapidly and are therefore challenging to foresee. Tsagourias further states that attribution is important for the counteraction to be effective but also lawful. All of these issues explained above consequently lead to the difficulty of holding States responsible for cyber operations. Without being able to infer responsibility on States, the risk is that actors will have free reigns in cyberspace. Furthermore, States will not be able to use countermeasures in order to protect themselves against the attack.</p>\n\n<p>The international legal system is based on consent and the fact that States are sovereign and equal. However, it does happen that States perform internationally wrongful acts. If that happens, the targeted State may be able to use non-forcible measures against the State breaching the international rule. These non-forcible measures are referred to as countermeasures.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 637, "completion_tokens": 412, "total_tokens": 1049}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The first one is by attribution. The problems of attribution in cyberspace have already been explained in previous chapters. The second way is where the State fails to satisfy the due diligence principle. If attribution in cyberspace has been considerably discussed by academics, the due diligence principle in cyberspace has received significant less attention. Furthermore, military responses to cyber attacks has gained much more focus than situations below the threshold of use of force, both in academic and political debate.</p>\n    <p>This disproportional focus does not mirror the reality, which is that there are no cyber operations which have actually been at the level of an armed attack, and it is much more common with peacetime cyber operations. It is also a fact that many of the authors of cyber operations are private individuals or international organizations. These subjects are generally not able to be held responsible for acts contrary to international law and it is, usually, not possible to attribute the acts to a State. However, the State may still have international responsibility for these acts, if the State failed in some obligation to prevent the act in question. In that case, responsibility is the consequence of a State\u2019s own failings, not the direct result of the actions of private individuals. Attribution and due diligence have previously been referred to as direct and indirect responsibility.</p>\n    <p>Due diligence is a general obligation, which assumes its meaning depending on the context and in relation to another specific international norm. The due diligence principle in Corfu Channel is rather simplistic in its expression compared to the formulation in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 for example. This chapter will examine the history of due diligence, its development in environmental law, and the applicability and scope of due diligence in the field of cyberspace.</p>\n    \n    <h3>4.2 The history of due diligence</h3>\n    <p>As has already been stated, due diligence refers to the obligation of States to ensure that their territory is not being used to affect the rights of a third State.

However, it would take until the 19th century before due diligence began to assume its current form and to impose a duty on States. In the early days, because of the increased movement of people across territorial borders, due diligence became important for the protection of aliens. For example, Justice Moore observed in the SS Lotus Case that \u201cit is well settled that a State is bound to use due diligence to prevent the commission within its dominions of criminal acts against another nation or its people\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of State sovereignty also emerged stronger during the 19th century and led to a requirement of States to protect \u201cthe security of other States in times of peace and war\u201d. The principle of sovereignty is well-established in international law and means that States are prohibited from violating the sovereignty of another State. The principle of sovereignty is expressed, for example, in Article 2(1) of the UN Charter. Due diligence is derived from this principle. In the Island of Palmas case (1928), territorial sovereignty was interpreted as including an obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States. Max Huber, the arbitrator in the case, stated that \u201c[t]erritorial sovereignty \u2026 involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war\u201d. If a State enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, necessarily there needs to be a corresponding legal obligation.</p>\n\n<p>The term due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The commentary to Art. 2 states that whether responsibility is \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018subjective\u2019 in this sense depends on the circumstances, including the content of the primary obligation in question. The articles lay down no general rule in that regard. The same is true of other standards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability, negligence or want of due diligence.

Furthermore, the Commentary held that States are not responsible for the acts of private individuals if they are, for example, seizing an embassy (which the rules of attribution make clear), but \u201cit will be responsible if it fails to take all necessary steps to protect the embassy from seizure, or to regain control over it\u201d. From this it is clear that the Commission did indeed consider the obligation of due diligence.</p>\n\n    <p>Due diligence saw the biggest development in practice in the field of environmental law during the second half of the 20th century. Since due diligence was not included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Commission included the concept in other contexts. Perhaps the most prominent one is in the Draft Articles on the Prevention of Transboundary Harm. The Commentaries to the Draft Articles expressed that the duty to take \u201cpreventing or minimization activities measures is one of due diligence\u201d.</p>\n\n    <p>Case law has repeatedly referred to the notion of due diligence. For example, in the Trail Smelter Arbitration case (1941), which concerned an environmental dispute between the United States and Canada, the Tribunal stated that under the principles of international law, as well as the law of the United States, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury by fumes in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein, when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence.

It is claimed that the Tribunal analogized from domestic decisions in order to \u201ccreate\u201d an international principle. While this may be true to a certain extent, it is important to remember that the obligation of due diligence existed already as a concept before the case. The Tribunal only expanded on the content of due diligence by referring to domestic decisions. One might claim that the international principle formulated in the case should be restricted to the specific circumstances of the case, or that it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law. This discussion will be continued in Chapter 4.3 when the development of due diligence in environmental law is examined.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the notion of due diligence can be seen outside of environmental case law. If there was ever any doubt about the application of the due diligence principle outside of the environmental area, that doubt was erased by the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case. In 1949, the ICJ in the Corfu Channel case tried the State responsibility regarding the laying of mines in Albania\u2019s territory by an unnamed third party. The Court held Albania responsible because of the State officials\u2019 knowledge of the activity and their omission to warn shipping in the area. The Court stated that it is \u201cevery State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u201d. The Court identified it as a general and well-recognized principle.

The UN Security Council has repeatedly, in 1999 and in 2000, demanded that the Taliban (at that point, the Afghanistan\u2019s government), take appropriate effective measures to ensure that the territory under its control is not used for terrorist installations or camps, or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts against other States or their citizens.</p>\n    \n    <p>There are many references to due diligence in the sources of international law, although the term itself is at times absent. This is especially true for international treaty law. There are exceptions, such as the 2011 Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence against Women, which explicitly includes due diligence in article 5. Despite these rare exceptions, it is fair to say that the term is not in frequent use. Nonetheless, due diligence is an essential feature of international law.

It is generally true, that the more general a legal concept is, the easier it can stand the test of time. Therefore, it is not surprising that due diligence remains a prominent standard of influential law and that its use has spread, and is still spreading, to other areas of international law besides environmental law.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 714, "completion_tokens": 431, "total_tokens": 1145}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

Therefore, the application and scope of due diligence in environmental law will be examined in this chapter.</p>\n    <p>In environmental law, due diligence obligations have been included in a number of international treaties. For example, Article 192 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that \u201cStates have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment\u201d. Article 194(2) of UNCLOS states that \u201cStates shall take all measures necessary to ensure that activities under their jurisdiction and control are so conducted as not to cause damage by pollution to other States and their environment\u201d. Shaw says that \u201c[t]he test of due diligence is in fact the standard that is accepted generally as the most appropriate one\u201d. At the same time, he concludes that what exactly due diligence means, is not obvious. In some cases, such as the due diligence obligation prescribed for in UNCLOS, the measures are specified and there are references to other relevant treaties. But at other times, the matter is more uncertain. Nonetheless, the prevention of transboundary harm is a key component in international environmental law. Due diligence is necessarily a huge part of this.</p>\n    <p>Article 3 of the ILC Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities, adopted in 2001, states that States \u201cshall take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm or at any event to minimize the risk thereof\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The Commentary to the Draft Articles further adds that: The obligation of the State of origin to take preventive or minimization measures is one of due diligence. It is the conduct of the State of origin that will determine whether the State has complied with its obligation under the present articles.

In this sense, it does not guarantee that the harm would not occur. The Commentary, therefore, besides confirming that due diligence is an obligation of conduct, clarifies that the State is not obligated to do more than what is possible. The State simply has to do its best to prevent the transboundary harm. Even if the State fulfills its due diligence obligation, it is not a guarantee that there will be no harm. UNCLOS similarly clarifies in Article 194(1) that States only need to use \u201cthe best practicable means at their disposal and in accordance with their capabilities\u201d. Although, this is not stated directly in relation to the due diligence obligation, but in the paragraph regulating prevention of pollution from any source. It is reasonable to assume that the State have a stricter obligation when the source is in fact from within their own jurisdiction or control. What is clear from the treaties and the case law is that there is a standard of reasonableness included in the due diligence obligation. What States need to do in order to fulfill its obligation is expressed in different ways depending on the context. Terminology used is, for example, that States should use all appropriate measures, use all measures necessary, or use all the means at their disposal. What is also implied, and sometimes directly expressed, is that States are not obligated to do more than they are able to do.</p>\n\n<p>The cause of an environmental damage to a nearby State is often a private company. The Trail Smelter Arbitration case, mentioned above, is one example of this. The case concerned a private company in Canada which was located close to the border with the United States of America. The company polluted the environment in the United States and a Tribunal was established to resolve the dispute between the States and led to the reference by the Tribunal to the standard of due diligence. Because the actor was a private company, the State responsibility rules of attribution could not be used. Instead, the State responsibility was based on the obligation of States to not permit the use of its territory in a manner injurious to other States.</p>\n\n<p>As recent as 2010, the ICJ in its Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case confirmed that \u201cthe principle of prevention, as a customary rule, has its origins in the due diligence that is required of a State in its territory\u201d before going on to cite the Court\u2019s fundamental statement in Corfu Channel.

It is possible, for example, to argue that the Trail Smelter Arbitration case had some specific circumstances and that the principle should be limited to these. Perhaps it should simply be considered a principle of environmental law, or even limited to cases dealing with fumes.

The Area means the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The Council of the International Seabed Authority submitted the Advisory Opinion to the Seabed Disputes Chamber and requested that the Chamber rendered an advisory opinion on certain questions of, inter alia, legal responsibilities and obligations of States. The Chamber therefore had the opportunity to add to the case law of due diligence.

The use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) was further elaborated in the dispute concerning Certain Activities Carried out by Nicaragua, where the ICJ emphasized that in order to prevent significant transboundary harm, the due diligent obligation triggers the procedural obligations to carry out an EIA and, if the EIA confirms a risk of significant harm, to notify and consult the potentially affected State.</p>\n    \n    <p>The Court\u2019s instructions on what a State should do to fulfill the obligations can be divided into three steps. The first step is to assess whether there is a risk of transboundary harm. The second step is, if the State establishes that there is such a risk, to carry out an EIA. The content of the assessment is up to the State to decide for each case.

This also follows the prerequisite of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. Due diligence is a general principle of international law which so far has been adapted to different areas of law. Because it is such a flexible concept, as pointed out already in the examination of the principle in the area of environmental law, it can easily be adapted to fit in the cyber context.

The basis of this rule is the general international law principle that \u201cStates must exercise due diligence in ensuring territory and objects over which they enjoy sovereignty are not used to harm other States\u201d. The International Group of Experts have used the commonly accepted definition in the Corfu Channel case when formulating the principle in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and express that due diligence is the \u201cstandard of conduct expected of States when complying with this principle\u201d.

This may not seem so implausible, since it would not be reasonable for the target State to have to put an end to the cyber operation if the operation itself was not unlawful. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example regarding this. If State A is monitoring State B\u2019s governmental databases by using cyber infrastructure in State C, State C does not have a due diligence obligation to terminate the operations. The reason for this is that the monitoring amounts to cyber espionage, and cyber espionage is not unlawful under international law. The International Group of Experts also held that the due diligence obligation only applies to a State \u201cwhen the cyber operation that is being mounted from or through its territory would be unlawful under international law if it had been conducted by the territorial State itself.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>However, the matter becomes more complicated when including non-State actors in the due diligence scenarios. States are the only entities capable of performing acts amounting to internationally wrongful acts. Cyber operations conducted by non-State actors, which are not attributable to a State, are not considered internationally wrongful acts. It is, generally speaking, States, not non-State actors, that violate international law. The International Group of Experts nonetheless agreed that the due diligence principle applies also for cyber operations where the author is a non-State actor, provided that the cyber operation result in serious adverse consequences and affect a right of the target State. This is consistent with the position taken in environmental law, where also the conduct of non-State actors activates the due diligence obligation.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens": 410, "total_tokens": 1100}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Especially since the due diligence principle is particularly well suited for these types of situations.</p>\n\n<p>Besides having to amount to an internationally wrongful act, the conduct also needs to affect a right of the target State. It is not enough that it is a harmful cyber operation. One example of this is when the cyber operation violates the sovereignty of the target State. Since non-State actors cannot generally affect a right of a State, it has to be determined if the non-State cyber operation would breach an obligation that the territorial State owes the target State had the territorial State been the one conducting the cyber operation in question. An example provided by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is if a private company publishes highly classified documents of the target State online. The due diligence principle will not be applicable to this case since no international law right of the target State is affected. Naturally, the territorial State should not have to prevent the acts of a private company, when it would not be in breach of international law had it published the documents itself.

Cyber operations could potentially harm vital infrastructures in our society, such as hospitals and governmental entities. The due diligence principle includes a form of harm for it to be applicable. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 holds that the due diligence principle applies only in situations when the cyber operation affects the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.

Furthermore, it held that the precise threshold depends on the circumstances in each case and that physical damage is not a requirement.

The second case is when a State has control over government cyber infrastructure abroad.

If a State has knowledge of a terrorist group that is going to cross its territory to attack a third State, the State has a duty to act and to prevent this attack. There is no reason that this should not be the case for illegal cyber attacks. At the same time, however, it is unlikely that a transit State could be held responsible for violating the due diligence principle, mostly due to the rapidity of transit in cyberspace, but also because it would be extremely difficult to prove that the transit State had knowledge of these actions. The International Group of Experts came to the same conclusion, even stating that it is unlikely that a transit State would even know of or be able to identify the cyber traffic transiting their cyber infrastructure. However, if they do have the knowledge and the ability to prevent the cyber operation, they have an obligation to do so.</p>\n\n<p>A State does generally not have an obligation to prevent harm if the State does not have knowledge of the situation which obliges action.

There is nothing controversial about the due diligence applying for actual knowledge. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 gives an example of a State having actual knowledge when its intelligence agencies have detected a harmful cyber operation from within its territory or if the State has received credible information about such a cyber operation.

The International Group of Experts concluded that the rule includes constructive knowledge. This means that if the State did not know about the cyber operation in question, but objectively should have known about it, the due diligence obligation still applies. Turning to case law, it seems to agree that the principle would be applicable to certain cases of constructive knowledge.

This has already been made clear from the way it is defined and the content of the principle. However, it deserves to be highlighted that it is a principle of reasonableness and flexibility. In fact, due diligence is often described as providing a \u201creasonable\u201d standard of conduct. It is a flexible concept, and it only prescribes that States act in a duly diligent manner. It does not care about the end result. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. This is not uncommon for international law since it tends to focus on the behavior of States instead of the outcomes of their behavior. The obligation simply means that a State is required to take all measures it could reasonably be expected to take. This is in line with the due diligence principle in environmental law as well, as the Commentary to the Draft Articles on Transboundary Harm, for example, conclude that States do not need to do more than what is possible.</p>\n    <p>It has further become clear from the examination of the principle in environmental law that the principle is easily adapted and that it depends on the context what is required of States. What is reasonable is undoubtedly difficult to determine, but it is safe to say that the due diligence principle suggests that States have different obligations depending on the circumstances, including the level of (economic) development of a State. It should also imply that States have much discretion in choosing the means to prevent the cyber operation. Other factors that may be important for the test of reasonableness are, for example, control over territory, the degree of the risk and the existence (or absence) of bona fide acts. The ICJ\u2019s judgment in the Tehran Hostages case further supports that States only have to take appropriate steps to prevent harm of a third State if it has \u201cthe means at [its] disposal to perform [its] obligations\u201d. Additionally, it is clear already from the Commentary to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility that obligations of prevention, which due diligence must count as, \u201care usually construed as best efforts.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 756, "completion_tokens": 509, "total_tokens": 1265}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

Although the standard of reasonableness does not have any clear content or criteria, general guidelines from other areas of international law, such as international environmental law, can be used to establish the scope of the principle. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 also includes reasonableness throughout their commentary on Rule 6. For example, the International Group of Experts states that \u201c[i]f it is unreasonable to expect the territorial State to have known of the operation in the attendant circumstances and to have been able to terminate it, this Rule will not have been breached\u201d. The reasonableness is further elaborated on in Rule 7 about compliance with the due diligence principle, which states that <b>[t]he principle of due diligence requires a State to take all measures that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a right of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.</b> Rule 7 clarifies that the territorial State must take all reasonably available measures in order to prevent or stop the attack.</p>\n\n<p>The ILA Study Group on Due Diligence also expressed that \u201cit is well-established that developing States may not be able to control the activities in their territory in a similar manner to developed States, and that this will affect the evaluation of whether they have breached their due diligence obligation\u201d. Developing States may therefore be permitted to use less diligence than developed States. It is clear that the capabilities of a State are taken into consideration when applying the due diligence principle.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, the flexibility and the lack of definitions is also combined with problems. Reasonableness involves a standard for the measures taken related to what could be expected of a State. It is difficult to define what is reasonable and to set up requirements of what is expected of States.

Since this is an area still in development, there is no clear answer to this question. Due diligence seeks to answer the question of whether States have taken reasonable measures to prevent the injury to other States. A State will not be said to have violated the due diligence principle simply by not adopting legislation or protecting its cyber infrastructure. It has already been stated that due diligence necessitates some sort of harm. Article 14(3) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility state that \u201c[t]he breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs\u201d. Similarly, if a State has knowledge of a cyber operation, and the means to stop it, but chooses not to, it will still not be in breach of its due diligence obligation if the cyber operation does not cause serious adverse consequences for another State.

It is yet to be ascertained the degree of due diligence in relation to cyber operations. Nonetheless, a few things can be, and have already been, said regarding the scope of the principle. For example, there seems to be an evolving consensus amid scholars and State legal advisers that there is no obligation of States to monitor cyber activities on their territory or to prevent the wrongful use of their cyber infrastructure. The International Group of Experts concluded that the due diligence principle does not include an obligation to prevent and therefore there is no obligation for States to monitor cyber activities on their territory. However, this is not undisputed. Bannelier-Christakis concluded, on the contrary, that due diligence does imply \u201cnot only an obligation to react but also to prevent\u201d.

It is well established customary law and the issue here is simply to understand the shape and form of the principle in relation to cyber operations. In my opinion, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 is a great addition to the doctrine of due diligence in cyberspace. The International Group of Experts\u2019 arguments are well-founded, and it greatly follows the case law and seems to be in line with the few existing statements about due diligence in cyberspace. Although Rule 6 is necessarily kept general, it is a start to shaping the due diligence principle in the field of cyberspace.</p>\n<p>While there is reason to keep the due diligence obligation to a minimum, at least for now, some authors consider the scope too narrow to make a difference. For example, Stockburger argues that a preventive feature should be included in the due diligence obligation. By using the precautionary approach, it would help the due diligence principle to crystallize and it would encourage adherence to the principle. He also argues for a cyber impact assessment to determine if the State\u2019s actions would potentially affect the rights and interests of another State. At the same time, he states that this is not customary international law at this moment in time, but that it is his argument of lex ferenda.</p>\n<p>The fear is also that if the principle is too general, it will not be useful and therefore considered redundant. The principle needs to be given content in order to effectively be used to hold States responsible for cyber operations emanating from their territory. Due diligence could be expanded in several ways, provided that the States agree to it. For example, the World Health Organization in Article 6(1) of its 2005 International Health Regulations imposes the duty on Member States to notify the organization \u201cof all events which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern within.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 1136}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It holds that a State may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal obligation that it is owed by another State. Rule 21 states that the purpose of countermeasures is to induce a responsible State to comply with the legal obligations it owes an injured State and Rule 22 lays down the limitations on countermeasures.

Granted, it is easier to simply establish the territory from where the cyber operation emanated than to additionally have to establish the person or group behind the attack.

It is possible, however, in some situations, to aim the countermeasures at a private entity, and not only at States.267 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides an example of a situation where countermeasures would be justified in a due diligence situation where the target is a private entity.268 Suppose that a private firm in State A is engaging in harmful cyber operations against a competitor in State B. In this case, State B can use countermeasures against the firm if State A has wrongfully failed to control the activities of the firm, thereby breaching its due diligence obligation to control its territory once it became aware of the operations, according to Rule 6 and 7 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0.269\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Not fulfilling its due diligence obligation constitutes an internationally wrongful omission by a State. It is important to remember that the injured State taking countermeasures based on that breach must be aware of the proportionality in its response. The countermeasure must be proportionate to the responsible State\u2019s omission, not to the severity and consequences of the cyber operations.270\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        This way of targeting private entities instead of States is somewhat rare in the international context. Generally in international law, States are not allowed to take measures against non-State actors. Self-defense and countermeasures only apply in relation to other States. However, the due diligence principle slightly \u201cside-steps\u201d that fact. Technically, the countermeasure will be against the State which failed its due diligence obligations, but in reality, the measure will be taken against the non-State actor, since that is how the targeted State will be able to defend itself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        As has been made clear by Rule 20 in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, the countermeasures can be either cyber countermeasures or non-cyber countermeasures, i.e. it need not be in kind. It is also worth mentioning that, at the time of writing, there are no known uses of countermeasures, within the meaning of the term in the State responsibility framework, in the field of cyberspace.271 State practice and opinio juris is therefore hard to come by.

The due diligence principle, as formulated in Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, was assessed in order to do this.</p>\n<p>It has been stated in this examination that international law generally applies in the same way in relation to cyber operations as to traditional armed operations. Cyber operations, however, create difficulties for State responsibility, especially because of the anonymity of the attacks. It is therefore extremely difficult to attribute cyber operations to States.</p>\n<p>Due diligence creates a special way of holding States responsible, without an act having to be attributed to the State. Instead, the due diligence principle affirms that States have a responsibility to ensure that their territory is not being used for harmful international activities which affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States. This general responsibility creates a lower threshold than attribution and can be used also when the operator of a cyber operation is a non-State actor.</p>\n<p>The main question of this study is whether the due diligence principle can be considered applicable in cyberspace. It has been concluded that the principle undoubtedly holds a status as an international customary rule. This has been confirmed both by case law, doctrine and a number of treaties. It is presumed in international law, that a principle, which has been established as a general principle of international law, is applicable to all areas of international law unless the contrary has been proved. Consequently, the general principle of due diligence must be considered applicable to cyberspace. That is the thesis of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which I agree with. There is no State practice or opinio juris, or at least not sufficient State practice or opinio juris, to show that the principle does not apply. Unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it, the due diligence principle applies.</p>\n<p>States may not have rejected the applicability of due diligence in cyberspace, but neither have they affirmed it. There are only a few statements available about due diligence. The ones that do mention it tend to confirm its applicability. Nonetheless, the statements are so few that it is not possible at this time to draw any conclusions about.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 652, "completion_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 1158}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

As stated, State practice must be widespread and consistent in order to establish a customary rule of international law. While the statements seem to be positive about the applicability of due diligence, the UN GGE have been a bit more reluctant to include it. This suggests that States were not able to agree on the due diligence obligation. While the conclusion at this time is that the principle is applicable to cyberspace, that may change if State practice and opinio juris develops in a different way. Furthermore, it is not enough to conclude that the principle is applicable. Since the principle is of a general character, it must be specified how it works in relation to cyber operations. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 has made a great attempt at clarifying this, but as has been stated before in this study, the manual does not hold status of a binding legal source. Additionally, the principle in the manual is still very general and the commentary only slightly manages to clarify the scope of the principle. Nonetheless, it has been established by the Tallinn Manual 2.0 that the territorial State needs to have knowledge of the malicious cyber operation and that the operation must be an international wrongful act, must affect a right of the target State and produce serious adverse consequences for the State. At the same time, there are issues which the International Group of Expert could not agree on. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 lay the groundwork for the scope of the due diligence principle, but there are still problems to solve.</p>\n\n<p>Further regulation is therefore necessary, and it must be established what the scope of the principle is, in order for it to be a valuable tool in the fight against malicious cyber operations. States need to come together to solve the issues in this emerging field of international law. Harmonization and regulation are important both for the efficiency of the due diligence principle, but also as a way to ensure that there is a fair balance between different interests. Harmful cyber operations will only increase in numbers unless the problem of unclear and unrealistic attribution requirements is solved. It is also necessary with a regulation of countermeasures which is compatible with cyber operations.</p>\n\n<p>6.2 As we look to the future\u2026 The UN General Assembly once again, in December 2018, requested the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental experts to continue to study, inter alia, how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens": 502, "total_tokens": 1168}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Introduction</h2>\n<p>This essay will explain that the rules on the prohibition of the use of force established in Articles 2(4), 42 and 51 of the United Nations Charter (UNCH) are in fact outdated to address conflicts in the 21st century. About this, it will be demonstrated that what is outdated are the rules about self-defense in cases of armed attacks by non-state actors like, for example, ISIL. The present essay will first develop the general requirements detailed in the United Nations Charter for the use of force in case of an armed attack and how they have been used by nations to address conflicts. In the second section, it will be analyzed the application of the principle of self-defense as the exception to the prohibition of the use of force. The third section will address the consideration of anticipatory self-defense. In the fourth section, I will discuss the shift in development since the 9/11 attacks on the United States of America, especially the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense proposed by the United States of America. Finally, I will explain how 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those who usually destroy physical assets.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The general rules of the prohibition of the use of force under the United Nations Charter</h2>\n<p>In this section, I will address two main issues. The first aspect to analyze is to understand which is the prohibition\u2019s scope if it involves the threat of use of force, the use of force or both. In the second term, I will analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is, if the use of force is allowed or not when is consistent with the purposes of the United Nations Charter.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 718, "completion_tokens": 583, "total_tokens": 1301}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It is a treaty-based rule because it is recognized in the United Nations Charter, but at the same time is accepted as being representative of customary international law in the terms expressed by the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) in the Nicaragua case. Article 2(4) of the UNCH express that members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations (UN). The article reflects the idea that all UN members must abstain from the use of force in their international relations and the threat of the use of force against 1) territorial integrity or 2) political independence of any State.</p>\n\n    <p>Furthermore, the prohibition of Article 2(4) has two faces, first, to threat the use of force, and second, to the use of force. In this sense, the International Court of Justice (from now on ICJ) in both the Nicaragua case and the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons concluded that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself illegal. The pronouncement of the ICJ in the Nicaragua case is of extreme importance. Regarding the interpretation of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, it has established that not only the laying of mines in Nicaraguan waters and attacks on Nicaraguan ports and oil installations by United States forces but also the support for the opposition forces (the Contras) engaged in forcible struggle against the government, could constitute a use of force. Even more, the army and training of the Contras involved an unlawful use of force against Nicaragua.</p>\n\n    <p>On the other hand, in the Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons, the ICJ held that a threat of force is unlawful where the actual use of the force threatened would be itself unlawful, then refusing to find that mere possession of nuclear weapons was an unlawful threat of force. Until 1970 there was a discussion whether economic coercion was considered a threat of the use of force or not. However, the UN General Assembly Declaration on Friendly Relations of 1970 settled this discussion, and now there is a broad understanding that economic coercion is expressly prohibited.</p>\n\n    <p>In the second term, I will now analyze if the prohibition is absolute or relative, that is if the prohibition is total or can be interpreted to allow the use of force for actions according to the</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 980, "completion_tokens": 568, "total_tokens": 1548}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Gonzalo J. Arias</p>\n    <p>The purposes of the United Nations are detailed in Article 1 of the Charter in order to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. In consequence, what needs to be analyzed is if the use of force is allowed when consistent with the mentioned purposes.</p>\n    <p>An absolute interpretation can be found in Olivier Corten\u00b4s research. He has explained that it is necessary to consider articles 2(4) and 51 of the United Nations Charter to obtain a text-oriented interpretation, according to the rules of sections 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Corten addressed his arguments to understand that, because the United Nations Charter is a treaty itself, it should be governed and interpreted by the rules of the Vienna Convention; especially, the interpreter must apply the rules for interpretation provided in Articles 31 and 31. Following those standards, the Charter should be interpreted in good faith by the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and the light of its object and purpose.</p>\n    <p>In other words, according to the text, the context and the purposes of the Charter previously explained, the use of force is only allowed when is consistent with the United Nations Charter: that is, in the case of self-defense, the major exception to the general prohibition.</p>\n    <p>On the other hand, a relative interpretation, which is to consider the use of force outside of the scope of the Charter, has remained exceptional even when there is some discussion about the extent of it as it is reflected in cases of use of force in pursuit of self-determination or the use in pursuit of democracy. There is a minority opinion by D\u00b4Amato that the use of force to restore democratic governments is not prohibited by Article 2 (4) of the Charter. However, this view has not been considered by states.</p>\n    <p>The conclusion of this section is that the prohibition of the use of force relates to both the threat and use; an absolute interpretation of the prohibition seems to be the right one, as it is with the text, context, and purposes of the Charter. Finally, a relative application of the principle should remain under consideration for exceptional discussion and only for the mentioned cases.</p>\n    <p>The following section will now address the right to self-defense as the primary exception to the general rule of prohibition of the use of force.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 837, "completion_tokens": 600, "total_tokens": 1437}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It expresses that nothing in the Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Actions taken by members in the exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the Chart to take at any time such action as it deems necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.</p>\n    <p>The scope of the provision is controversial as to understand if the right to self-defense of Article 51 is exhaustive or, on the contrary, there is a wider customary right that goes beyond the right to respond to an armed attack. A restrictive interpretation of the right to self-defense is based on the text of Article 51 of the Charter; as the provision establishes a restriction on the right to self-defense in response to armed attacks, it seems complicated to preserve a wider right, unlimited by the limitations of Article 51. Also, the right of self-defense is in itself an exception to the principle of the use of force, in consequence, it should be analyzed narrowly. A broad interpretation as to anticipatory self-defense and the necessity of imminent attack will be explained in the following section.</p>\n    <p>The scope of the right to self-defense cannot be found in Article 51. Nevertheless, self-defense is part of the corpus of customary international law. It is agreed that it must be necessary and proportionated. The scope of the right has been recognized in several decisions by the ICJ such as the Nicaragua case. The ICJ adopted a restrictive view of the right of self-defense, although it expressly left open the question of the legality of anticipatory self-defense. The Court recognized that a separate customary international law right of self-defense continues to exist alongside Article 51 of the Charter, but concluded that an armed attack was a pre-condition underpinning both sources.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, the definition of armed attack cannot be found in the UNCH, and it is also a construction of customary international law.

Other interpretation would probably be restrictive.</p>\n\n<p>It is clear is that the right to self-defense requires of an armed attack and that the response from the attacked state needs to be necessary and proportionate. However, a question is raised regarding an armed attack: should states wait until the attack is launched, or is there any international rule to prevent the attack in cases of the imminence of use of force? This discussion will be addressed in the next section.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize the previous part, the present essay has provided grounds to acknowledge that it is unquestionable that the right to self-defense is the core exception to the use of force under the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Likewise, it is also evident that both the scope of the right of self-defense and the definition of armed attack are constructions from customary international law and not sourced in treaty-based rules. Finally, it is necessary to remark that the primary concern is to determine whether the right to self-defense requires an attack that is being committed or the right to defend is also applicable in cases of imminent attacks. The latter will be developed in the next segment of this essay.</p>\n\n<p>In this section, I will highlight the importance of the discussion whether Article 51 of the United Nations Charter provides a limited exercise of the right of self-defense or if it should consider a wider application of it. Professor Christine Gray has explained that a major controversy of the scope of the right to self-defense was the idea of a right of anticipatory or pre-emptive self-defense.18 She asks if the right to self-defense only arise after an armed attack has started under Article 51 or if there is a wider right to anticipate an imminent attack.19</p>\n\n<p>The source of the discussion comes from the reading of Article 51. The Charter as a treaty does recognize the right to self-defense but not the right to an anticipatory self-defense, and the UN General Assembly Definition of Aggression and Declaration on Friendly Relations neither do so. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the question whether is there a rule of customary law about it?</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 762, "completion_tokens": 506, "total_tokens": 1268}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

At the time, Canada was under British control while the United States of America and The United Kingdom were in an apparent state of peace. There was a vessel owned by U.S. nationals, the Caroline, that was allegedly aiding the rebels in Canada. On December 29, 1837, while the ship was on the U.S. side of the Niagara River, British troops crossed the river, boarded the ship, killed several U.S. nationals, set the ship on fire, and sent the vessel over Niagara Falls. The British claimed that they were acting in self-defense, but after some heated exchanges with Secretary of State Daniel Webster, the British government ultimately apologized. The fundamental characteristics of the anticipatory self-defense principle were developed from this case: necessity and proportionality.</p>\n<p>Professor Van den hole has explained that the preconditions set in the Caroline case, necessity and proportionality, have been extended to the right of anticipatory self-defense in the form of general rule of customary international law. The conditions for the application of anticipatory self-defense requires a threat that is instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice of means nor moment for deliberation. Furthermore, what the Caroline incident and its following doctrinal analysis had established is that there is an important distinction that requires being understood, that is the imminence of the attack. While the right to self-defense demands the attack being launched, the right to anticipatory self-defense can prevent the attack if the conditions for its application are fulfilled.</p>\n<p>It is important to remark that states like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Israel have claimed a broad right to self-defense in the terms previously exposed.

Furthermore, there is a discussion whether the Caroline test is enough to prevent an armed attack or it is necessary a broader analysis that considers that an imminent threat is configured when any further delay would result in an inability by the vulnerable state to defend itself against or avert the attack against it.

Furthermore, it has also provided information regarding the principal exemption to the utilization of the force; that is the right to self-defense. Likewise, I have provided arguments to understand that this is not a simple issue, on the contrary, it is a complex and highly contested one. Following these ideas, this paper has also presented evidence about the discussion of a broad understanding of the right to self-defense regarding the anticipatory self-defense doctrine. The Caroline case in the 19th century was the cornerstone for the developing of the theory: it demanded that the attack should be imminent and not necessarily launched to prevent it. Once the conditions of the doctrine were fulfilled, a state can respond in a proportionated way to exercise its right to self-defense. This is important to remark: the response to an attack or an imminent attack should always be proportioned to the attack or the imminence of attack. Otherwise, the proportionality condition of the right to self-defense is not verified and therefore escapes from the scope of the right under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.</p>\n    \n    <p>As it was explained, an imminent attack is the core condition for the application of anticipatory self-defense. Nevertheless, this topic is still an under constant discussion and analysis by states. The exercise of the right to self-defense in case of the use or threat of use of the force has been traditionally studied when a state-actor attacks or threatens to attack another state-actor. It is not difficult to find examples of this attacks, in 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, the 1950\u00b4s Vietnam War, the 1950\u00b4s North Korean invasion of South Korea, among others. However, since the last decade or so conventional or traditional attacks from one state are no longer the general rules. Since the attack the United States of America suffered on September 11, 2001, new actors have raised: non-state actors. The importance and, in particular, the consequences of their actions have created awareness if the rules for self-defense or anticipatory self-defense established in the United Nations Charter can address this attacks. In other words, has the United Nations Charter and rules of customary international law the ability to provide adequate answers to non-state actors attacks?</p>\n\n    <p>The next two sections of this essay will present solid arguments to conclude that the provisions of the Charter are outdated and insufficient to deal with non-state actors attacks. I will address that the definition for attacking state and armed attack are both inadequate and outdated to address current problems like attacks from non-state actors, such as IS/ISIS and cyber-attacks, whether they come from state or non-state actors.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 766, "completion_tokens": 573, "total_tokens": 1339}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

A right to a pre-emptive self-defense?</h2>\n  <p>The facts, causes, and consequences of the 9/11 attacks have been extensively studied and explained. Therefore, this essay would not consider those issues in detail. Attacks from terrorist groups as an example of non-state actors are by no means a new form of conflict. One of the first ones occurred in October 1985, when Israel bombed the Palestinian Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. The second major incident took place in April 1986 when the United States attacked Libyan government facilities in Tripoli following a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub. The third incident was when the United States used force to respond to terrorism when it fired cruise missiles at Iraq in 1993, following the discovery of a plot to assassinate former President George H. Bush while in Kuwait. The final significant incident before 9/11 occurred in 1998 when the United States attacked an Al-Qaida terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and an alleged chemical weapons factory in Sudan.</p>\n  <p>It is important to highlight that, despite the fact that the attacks were committed by non-state actors, the common characteristic among them is that they were less likely to satisfy the threshold of an armed attack than the 9/11 attacks. At this point is necessary to remind that the definition of armed attack is not provided by the United Nations Charter and is a rule of customary international law. A significant consequence of this is that the concept requires being updated to satisfy current forms of attack. Nevertheless, September 11, 2001, marked a shift towards new considerations to address the conflict of armed attacks from non-state actors.</p>\n  <p>A new reality was conceived from the 9/11 attacks; non-state actors are capable of projecting extreme violence across the globe. The September 11 attackers were a variety of individuals trained and recruited across different states, which were instructed and funded by a terrorist organisation named Al-Qaeda. This group had acquired the means to launch vicious attacks that within a matter of hours killed more than three thousand people, mostly civilians.</p>\n  <p>The attack the United States suffered from the terrorist group Al-Qaeda raised new considerations regarding the use of force as the mean to respond to armed attacks.

Pre-emptive self-defense is a claim to entitlement to use unilaterally, without previous or international authorization, high levels of violence to stop an incipient development that is not yet operational or directly threatening, but that, if permitted to mature, could be seen by the potential attacked-state as susceptible to neutralization only at a higher and possible unacceptable cost to itself. One can see the main difference between the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense and pre-emptive self-defense. While the former demands the existence of an imminent attack to be launched, the latter excludes that condition for the application of the right to self-defense. The discussion of this issue was not a simple one. Even when the theory first was developed by the United States of America post-September, 11 attacks the discussion was strictly followed in the United Kingdom. As Daniel Bethlehem explains, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee expressed that the idea of imminence should be reconsidered in light of new threats to international peace and security regardless if pre-emptive self-defense is a new legal creation. However, despite the UK support to the US interpretation, the theory has not been internationally agreed, yet.</p>\n\n<p>Following the previous idea, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be a far too broad interpretation and application of the traditional concept of the right to self-defense. On the one hand, there is no requirement for a proportionated response. On the other, it does not consider the imminence of the attack. It is precisely the absence of those two conditions that make this interpretation both dangerous and unlimited. First, a state might consider the right to a pre-emptive self-defense even when there is no proof of a possible attack whatsoever. Secondly, if it is unlimited, there could be no restrictions for a state to claim the right how many times it deems as necessary. Finally, the application of the extensive interpretation of the right may lead us to revive a warfare environment similar to the Cold War. Following Reisman and Armstrong, Professor Donald Rothwell asked the next question, was international law adequate to deal with the threats posed by terrorist organizations or was there a need for new responses? He further explains that what is in stakes is the capacity of international law to respond to new scenarios, like terrorist attacks. In other words, the current discussion is if states have the right to take actions against non-state actors even when there is.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 904, "completion_tokens": 520, "total_tokens": 1424}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The doctrine has also shifted to the conjectural and contingent threat of the mere possibility of an attack at some future time, which is the threshold of pre-emptive self-defense, the self-assigned interpretive latitude of the unilateralist becomes wider. Finally, they said the nature and quantum of evidence that can satisfy the burden of proof resting on the unilateralist become less and less defined and is often, by the very character of the exercise, extrapolative and speculative.</p>\n    <p>Professor Andrew Garwood-Gowers has said that the post-9/11 right to use force in self-defense against terrorism is subject to some limitations derived from the general conditions governing self-defense, namely the gravity threshold for an armed attack the need for an actual attack to have occurred, and the principles of necessity and proportionality. This means that even when the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense appears to be too broad to be applied, it still demands compliance of the traditional requirements of the right to self-defense. However, besides this, the issue remains controversial.</p>\n    <p>The arguments presented by Professors Garwood-Gowers and Reisman and Armstrong reflect on the one hand the complexity of the evolution of the doctrine and on the other the necessity to adequate it to new and complex forms of attacks.</p>\n    <p>From the previous explanations, is clear that the traditional doctrine of treaty-based self-defense and customary based anticipatory self-defense have demonstrated to be insufficient to protect and prevent states from new manifestations of the use of force. This has created the need for new mechanisms to use force as a tool for self-defense whether anticipatory or pre-emptive. A reflection of this need is the doctrine of pre-emptive self-defense. Under this construction, the US government proposed the elimination of the condition of the imminence of the armed attack to respond by using force against the attacking state. Besides being a proposal from the US, a UN High-level Panel of Experts firmly rejected this doctrine.</p>\n    <p>This reflects a shift to adequate the definition of the right to self-defense as the reaction to the use of force. The change obeys to two main issues, first to a wider understanding of armed attacks.

The case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS and cyber-attacks</p>\n  \n  <p>From the previous sections, it is possible to conclude that the scope of the use of force and the right to self-defense have shifted during history. Furthermore, the extent of the right and it\u2019s interpretation and application has been moved not by the creation of new rules of international law, nor by customary regulations, they have extended the scope by the appearance of new international actors. New attackers and new forms of attack have caused debate whether the existing rules are enough to deal with issues like self-defense and the use of force. It is responsible for saying that the UNCH and the customary international law rules for the use of force and the right to self-defense (and anticipatory self-defense) are outdated and static. The definition for attacking state and armed attack are insufficient to address trending issues like attacks from non-state actors and cyber-attacks.</p>\n  \n  <h4>The case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIS (non-state actors)</h4>\n  <p>The United Nations Charter provisions lay down an aggressive regime of rules against force and states have considered the scheme to be too ambitious. However, these are rare instances, and in the clear majority of cases arguments about the legality of forcible conduct are tailored to fit the Charter regime. Nevertheless, this essay firmly believes that the rules must be reviewed and updated. The basis for the following construction is reflected in the US-led coalition attacks to ISIS in Syria and the research done by Professor Monica Hakimi.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a previous explanation, Operation Inherent Resolve is the name of the air campaign carried out by a Combined Joint Task Force of US-led coalition forces against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL. The terrorist group is at war with more than 60 nations or groups: coalition nations conducting airstrikes in Iraq include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States; coalition countries conducting airstrikes in Syria include Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. The particular characteristics of ISIS\u2019s attacks can be found in the fact that for the first time a terrorist group as a non-state actor can recruit agents to form all around the globe.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens": 529, "total_tokens": 1299}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

This reflects a need for modern interpretation of the rules to be useful in the regulation of the use of force and self-defense from non-state actors. However, the proper analysis on how to deal with these new players is still uncertain and contested. However, the thesis Hakimi presents is somehow limited because she provides a map of the positions that were plausible available when the US operations in Syria began to determine the application of self-defense. This is basically because the law in this area has been poorly settled and in consequence, there is broad legal reasoning that may be invoked.</p>\n\n<p>Hakimi further concluded that the case of US-led coalition attacks against ISIL reflects three main issues. First the fact that international law prohibits the use of defensive force against non-state actors is losing terrain. Second, States for different reasons have decided not to assume a position on this matter. Finally, this ambivalence has created a substantial gap between the rules that are articulated as law and those who reflect operational practice.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Paust has provided an interesting interpretation to address these issues and to acknowledge the right of both anticipatory and self-defense against non-state actors. Paust\u00b4s arguments are in the same line of thought than those presented by Professor Hakimi. He said the vast majority of writers agreed that an armed attack by non-state actors on a state could trigger the right of self-defense addressed in Article 51 of the UNCH. The grounds for his interpretation are in article 51 of the UNCH; nothing in the language restricts the right to engage in self-defense actions to circumstances of armed attacks by a state. Also, nothing in the language of the UNCH requires a conclusion that a state being attacked can only defend itself within its borders, he argues. Finally, by application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention, Article 51 needs to be read by its literal meaning (no exclusion of non-state). Also, the context (Chapter VII, Acts of aggression) doesn't differentiate between state and non-state actors. Finally, by its object and purpose that is provide measures to restore peace.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, other authors like Professor Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell have argued that States are restricted from using military force outside of self-defense or authorization from the Security Council. The right to use them must be found in the Jus ad Bellum, which would explicitly include the right of self-defense, and that significant military attacks are only lawful in the course of an armed conflict. For these reasons, she seems to be of the opinion that use of primary military force is not permissible unless the requirements for self-defense are met.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 944, "completion_tokens": 577, "total_tokens": 1521}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

In other words, she has concluded that attacks from non-state actors cannot be considered to be under the scope of the exception of Article 51 of the Charter unless they can be categorised as to be in the context of war. However, this position seems to have little recognition among international lawyers and governments who would search for any legal, political or military grounds to exercise the right to self-defense against non-state actors. Finally, this issue is not of peaceful resolution and remains controverted. Nevertheless, O\u00b4Connell\u00b4s argument has a substantial flaw. She is the idea that only in the context of war a response to the attack of a non-state actor is permissible. In other words, she left out of the discussion if the non-state actor performed the attack to a state o even if the non-state actor started a war. I firmly believe that this fundamental aspect cannot be taken out of the analysis. That is to say that if a non-state actor launches an attack on a state but it is not considered to be a war the attacked state cannot exercise a lawful right to self-defense? Furthermore, if a state has sufficient proof of an imminent attack from a non-state actor, it is not able to avoid it by anticipating it? These questions are by all means not easy to answer. However and taking into consideration Paust\u00b4s arguments there is no provision in the UNCH that has established the right to self-defense and even anticipatory self-defense only in cases of attacks from state actors. Another conclusion might lead us to open a door that could never be closed.</p>\n    \n    <p>The conclusion of this part is that attacks from non-state actors are not covered by the traditional provisions of the United Nations Charter nor by traditional rules of customary international law. However, latest attacks have demonstrated the necessity to adapt the rules and their interpretation with the sole purpose to address this kind of conflicts. The discussions Hakimi, Paust, D\u00b4Alessandra, and O\u00b4Connell, have presented are the core of the legal debate: are the Charter provisions outdated or are they useful to deal with these conflicts.</p>\n\n    <p>\u201cCyber\u201d is one of the most frequently used terms in international security discussions today. Thus, it is not a new term in international law.

However, certain developments since at least 2007 have pushed the term and what it stands for to a top position on their agendas.

In the future, hackers might target nation\u00b4s traffic lights, water supply, power grids, air traffic controls, or even its military weapon systems creating chaos, violence, and social unrest. Soon after the attacks on Estonia, North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO began developing policies and capacity aimed at cyber-security that was reflected in the Tallinn Manual explained in the following paragraphs.</p>\n    \n    <p>The second incident happened in 2008, during the Georgia\u2013Russia conflict over South Ossetia, when Georgia experienced cyber-attacks similar to those suffered by Estonia in the previous year. The methods of cyber-attacks against Georgia primarily included websites and launch of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against numerous targets \u2013 methods like those used in attacks against Estonia in 2007.

He provides a clear interpretation on the rules for cyber-attacks. The focus, Huang says, should be on the legal attribution of cyber operations especially whether and how the rules on state attribution can be applied to these activities. In other words, what Huang presents is the core of the discussion: how and who attribute cyber-attacks. This is not an easy task; however, what it is clear is that the rules of the treaty-based United Nations Charter and the rules of customary international law are not able to provide a solution nor a guidance for this understanding.</p>\n\n<p>To reinforce the previous ideas, Professor Michael Schmitt has explained that one of the most complex challenges states can face in incidents of cyber-attacks is that the scope and manner of the rules of international law applicable have remained unsettled since their conception. In consequence, he emphasises, there is a high risk that cyber practice may quickly outdistance agreed understanding as to its governing legal regime.</p>\n\n<p>From the previously stated, it is of great importance to remark, once again, that the Charter rules are outdated and static to address an answer to this matter; the difficulty is to determine what rules can offer guidance to deal with these conflicts. As it was previously explained the rules of the use of force and the right to self-defense contained in both a treaty and in customary international standards, have demonstrated to be ineffective to address this problem. It is not difficult to see why: the Charter was agreed almost 70 years ago when conflicts like cyber-attacks were not even possible or plausible. Thus, rules of customary international law on the right of self-defense have adapted to new scenarios; for example, they have incorporated guidance for attacks from non-state actors and regulations for anticipatory self-defense. Even a discussion of a possible pre-emptive self-defense has been addressed. In this sense, there are two essential provisions to address cyber-attacks as the new means of aggression and both reflect well-established customary rules of international law.</p>\n\n<p>Before continuing it is necessary to make a prevention; the scope of these essay is to provide information and arguments to understand why the United Nations Charter provisions are outdated and unable to address attacks from non-state actors and cyber attacks.

In principle, conducts of private actors will not be attributed to a State unless it is directed or controlled by the State. Furthermore, the Articles set up three rules for particular situations. First, the conduct of a person or group of individuals carried out in the absence or default of the official authorities. Second, conducts of insurrectional or other movements. Finally, an act acknowledged and adopted by a State as it owns, that shall be considered an act of that State under international law.</p>\n\n<p>The previous raises a fundamental question, are those rules for attribution updated and effective to determine State\u00b4s responsibility for non-state actors' cyber-attacks? This is a complicated task because these operations have unique particularities. .For example, hackers can easily hide their identity under IP tricks and even when cyber-attacks are readily available to non-state actors, most of them come from individuals. Furthermore, most cyber-attacks come from individuals rather than State, or State sponsored organisations. Thus, it is important to remark that a single actor can pose a devastating threat to a State through cyber-attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Huang has reached the conclusion that the ARSIWA rules have played a key role to determine the attribution of a cyber-attack in a sense they fully apply to the rules of use of the force and the right to self-defense because they ensure responsible attribution.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of this analysis is to recognise two core issues. First, the recognition that the traditional rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, ineffective and insufficient to deal with the complexity of cyber-attacks. Secondly, the rules of attribution presented in the ARSIWA Articles can be considered a step towards an appropriate regulation. However, the own structure of cyber-attacks should force the international community to be in constant awareness for new updates. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that it is crucial to bear in mind that the ARSIWA rules are a legal construction to determine state\u00b4s responsibility. They are a creation to try to solve the difficulties in attributing individual acts to a particular state. It is evident they have indeed reduced the risk of loopholes and legislation gaps, but they don\u00b4t solve the problem. As it was explained, the complexity of cyber attacks might pose an endless loop of determining responsibility to the extent of not being capable of it. Finally, it is clear that further regulations need to be developed to reduce the gap.</p>\n\n<p>The international rules on cyber warfare of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, or simply the Tallinn Manual, can also be applied for the</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 904, "completion_tokens": 551, "total_tokens": 1455}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

In that sense, Article 5 of the Tallinn Manual provides that a State should not knowingly allow the cyber infrastructure located in its territory or under its exclusive governmental control to be used for acts that adversely and unlawfully affect other States.

Secondly, infrastructure located elsewhere but over which the State has either de jure or de facto exclusive control. This is just the reflection of the well-understood principle of respect for the sovereignty of other States.</p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, on June 21, 2016, when this essay was being edited the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea were hit by cyber-attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world. Thus there was no word on who the hackers were. According to the news agency Reuters, no money was lost during the attacks.</p>\n  \n  <p>This latest attack reflects once again a problematic reality: treaty-based and customary international rules for the right to self-defense are outdated, insufficient and inefficient to address this issues. Furthermore, they also acknowledge the need for major updates on the rules for a) attribution of the conduct, b) determination of State\u00b4s responsibility, c) exercise the right to self-defense.</p>\n  \n  <p>As it was explained, the rules of the use of force and right to self-defense are in fact outdated. This is reflected during the past decade through several terrorist attacks that have re-enforced the necessity of updating mechanism to address non-state actors and cyber-attacks.</p>\n  \n  <p>As it was explained, 21st-century terrorist attacks have forced to extend the scope of application of the rules of the United Nations Charter because the traditional understanding of both state actors and armed attack have changed. On the one hand, during the last decade, not only states but also non-state actors have launched attacks from their states to other states. On the other, the traditional understanding of armed attack is not currently supportive of multiple and technological attacks from hackers or non-states actors to states by means different from those traditionally used. This has led to creating rules for attribution, to determine international.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 793, "completion_tokens": 481, "total_tokens": 1274}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}

These rules and principles are known as International Humanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory <strong>(Evans, 2005)</strong>.

Cyber Warfare affects computer systems and networks as a battlespace. International Law faces this difficulty. Without technology, war is unthinkable today. Cyberwarfare is a new tactic of warfare in armed conflicts. As modern warfare doesn't follow IHL standards and concepts. The legal vacuum in present legislation and issues IHL faces when considering Cyber Warfare is also noted. Eventually, IHL is adopted in Cyber Warfare to resolve problems quickly. In recent decades, the use of cyber methods in armed conflicts and how International Law applies to such circumstances has been a major concern. In this research paper, I first evaluate major humanitarian and legal concerns and show that the use of computer networks during armed conflicts is now a reality and a critical issue for the international community to address. In today's malware-ridden cultures, malicious cyber activities may disrupt and hurt people. \n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    Second, I present a short review of the international debate concerning cyber warfare during armed conflicts, focusing on the applicability of the Law of Armed Conflicts to cyber espionage. Cyber activities, or cyber warfare, are unquestionably governed by IHL. I also look at how IHL rules and principles apply to situations other than armed attacks involving cyber operations, as well as adequate protective regimes for cyber-attackers and infrastructure, such as health and humanitarian facilities. In this study, I examine whether IHL may be applied to cyber-warfare if it becomes an armed conflict. Conservative Critique evaluates the present IHL infrastructure to govern Cyber Warfare.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    More than 30 nations have backed initiatives to disrupt information networks throughout the globe in Cyber Warfare. Computer systems are often not the end target of attackers since they manage international infrastructures, such as airports or power grids. Attacking states may shut down airports and power infrastructure through computer networks. Almost all governments know that today's nations rely heavily on computer network systems for everything from transportation to commercial services. Hackers have codes that can be given by computers to collapse these systems, which might be just as effective and devastating as traditional military operations using guns, men, and missiles. \n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Cyberattacks may come from anywhere in the globe with little evidence, unlike kinetic armed operations. It's hard to track down an attack's perpetrator, making revenge harder. Cyberwarfare depends on a variety of factors. Such assaults involve the identification of people targeted, what the attackers are doing and how they accomplish it, and how much damage they wreak using malware.

Attacks must be severe to fulfill standards. Individual hacker assaults or hacker groups may not constitute Cyber Warfare unless backed and engaged by state agencies. In the dark age of Cyber Warfare, there are many hazy lines. Hackers are often given help by state officials so they can deny their operations. The legal status of Cyber Warfare is unknown, hence there are few rules or no International Law that may handle it. Cyber Warfare is handled by current legislation, although it's haphazard, unorganized, and susceptible to interpretation.</p>\n    <p>Many governments are motivated to exploit, and the lack of a legal framework has created a grey area. Many countries are unsure how states will respond to international law to investigate Cyber War methods. Law experts have spent years explaining how International Law applies to Cyberwarfare. The researchers' work led to the creation of the Tallinn Manual, a document produced by a group of legal specialists and sponsored by the NATO-affiliated Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.</p>\n    <h3>Material and Methods</h3>\n    <p>This work is going to use the Conservative Critique research methodology to critique the existing apparatus of IHL and its governance of the Cyber Warfare. Conservative Critique has been derived from the Conservatism of Thomas Hobbes where he wanted central authority for the state to function and remain intact. He propounded the need for clear laws and its enforcement to avoid any situation, where life would be brutish, nasty and short. Critical analysis techniques will be deployed to identify, examine and analyze the nature of Cyber Warfare and the deficiencies of IHL to deal with this challenge. The nature of the research is qualitative.</p>\n    <p>It is going to be a library based research where primary and secondary data will be used for the analysis. Primary data includes Geneva Conventions including its protocols while secondary data includes scholarly work of the expert in the relevant field. These will be articles, books, reports, and other types of narrations to be relied upon.</p>\n    <h3>Cyberwarfare Arguments</h3>\n    <p>IHL doesn't regulate Cyber Warfare, say many. Cyber Warfare is mostly unregulated under IHL. IHL may only apply to Cyber Warfare if it occurs during or causes a war. Whether a cyber-attack may approach the level of 'use of force' or 'armed assault' such that IHL rules apply to Cyber Warfare is questionable. Assigning the assault to a state or armed group will take time, but IHL cannot wait until then to assess whether the cyber-strike is a military operation. The international community needs clear norms and regulations that cover non-physical armed strikes to reflect 21st-century armaments and war technologies. The IHL often called the rules of armed conflict, is based on certain principles to discern between civilian and military objects and to protect civilians. IHL only applies in times of war, hence its principles are only valid then. Cyber warfare makes these concepts more important. IHL doesn't applicable to most cybercrimes and cyberespionage. It only applies to armed cyberattacks. In UN-mandated cyber procedures, it's disputed whether IHL applies to Cyber Warfare. When cyber-attacks target hospitals and grids, they violate IHL and the UN Charter, yet these bans won't safeguard computers.</p>\n    <h3>IHL Struggles</h3>\n    <p>This current world defies The Laws of War (IHL).

IHL's cyberwar challenge has established a new warfighting realm. Conflicting groups often deploy remote-controlled drones. IHL has several issues. Cyberwarfare will be emphasized.</p>\n    <p>IHL encompasses civilians and combatants. Law of War protects civilians and combatants. The US has invented the designation 'unlawful combatant' After 9/11, numerous Al-Qaida and Taliban militants were incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. They're illegal combatants. The US says they're neither civilians nor fighters. They don't fit any of the IHL's categories, hence they aren't protected. So they were tormented widely. Since IHL doesn't specifically define illegal combatants, the legality is challenged. This is a challenge. This study focuses on Cyber Warfare, not illegal combatants.</p>\n    <p>Child soldiers are another IHL concern. The participation of minors in wars is one of the legal efforts to control and underpins the creation of the rules of war. IHL aims to prohibit minors from being treated as prisoners of war if seized during armed conflict. Child soldiers should be treated as POWs. Children who commit war crimes or other terrible acts during wartime are protected from substantial punishment. Beginning in 1977, new protocols I and II oblige all state parties to take safeguards against child troops. Children under 15 shouldn't engage in conflicts or be enlisted in the military. The Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I define IHL violations as severe breaches. The high-contracting parties should penalize them under universal jurisdiction. IHL prohibits child soldiers. Additional Protocols I and II ban the recruitment of juvenile soldiers.</p>\n    <p>Killer robots are also a threat to IHL. Countries, professionals, and the public must investigate one of the most worrisome military technologies today. When no explicit convention or legislation exists on an issue, governments might outlaw the use of weapons beforehand under International Humanitarian Law. Rapid expansion in technology and AI might entail completely autonomous weapons, or \"Killer Robots,\" in the near future. This could be a problem for the international community.</p>\n    <p>Nearly 50 nations met at the UN in Geneva for the first formal conference on \"Killer Robots\" International Humanitarian Law is thorough and can adapt to new technology. IHL's history illustrates that new technologies threaten it. With AI, humans are more likely to employ it for military purposes. The international community is concerned about weaponry. Killer robots pose a significant danger to mankind and the Laws of War (IHL). The following section will detail the study on Cyber Warfare.</p>\n    <p>Beginning in the 20th century, nations and individuals became increasingly reliant on IT, the most significant development in contemporary times. They use computers and computer networks to run the entire state, including health care, businesses, and military operations, such as payroll and other records, sale and purchase, research and development, manufacturing, and dealing with armed forces, and delivery of food, water, and energy networks. Terrorists even utilize the internet to launch assaults, let alone governments. States employ cyberspace quickly in the battle to damage opponents' infrastructure, civilian items, and armed assets.</p>\n    <p>Cyberwar creates a distinct battlefield and challenges the rules of war (IHL).

The interstate use of cyber force is not regulated under international law. From state to individual persons in the 21st century, computers and advanced information technology are essential. The international community hasn't decided on how to apply international humanitarian law (\"IHL\") to modern battlefields. After describing the entire Internet system and emphasizing several cyber warfare incidents, this article will argue that Cyber Warfare violates the conventional concepts of difference and neutrality more than Conventional Warfare. States have huge incentives to participate in illicit cyberattacks notwithstanding the risk of war crimes charges. Cyber Warfare belligerents breach differentiation more than in traditional battles. Many cyber operations violate the principle of neutrality, so cyber conflicts are more likely to have these violations than traditional wars. Rather than criticizing all cyber means and methods, International Humanitarian Law should be understood and modified to encourage the use of cyber warfare in certain situations and give nations more direction on how to conduct these attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the numerous issues facing International Humanitarian Law are outlined above. This study will concentrate exclusively on Cyber Warfare and IHL. Future studies may concentrate on the other difficulties mentioned. Arguments in Favor of Cyber Warfare There are many arguments in support of Cyber Warfare in contrast to traditional or kinetic wars (Jones, & Janicke, 2015) Arguably, in the past, an actual Cyber War has never happened and is not occurring in the present and there are no signs of this happening in the future. Rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, so far cyber-attack that we can say has happened do not reach the level of an armed attack, in the eyes of International Law. As there was no harm to the lives of the civilians and the consequences were less than the kinetic attack which does not rise to amount to an act of war as damages to the data and hacking information do not amount to an armed attack, even cyber-attacks that because damages do so only indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, here, it is stated that Cyber Warfare is not a danger to international peace and security. It is further argued that instead, a cyber-attack that is launched with aim of material destruction or damage to the life of civilians must utilize the force or energy embedded in its target (Farwell, & Rohozinski, 2011) As for instance, disrupting electricity grids or shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or plains to crash do not inflict direct harm to the people as they are mostly carrying out by the hacker not by the state authorities and therefore cannot be considered a threat to international peace (Rid, 2013).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, cyber-attacks are more reasonably deniable than traditional attacks. The reputational cost of bringing a cyber-attack that causes collateral damage is likely to be less as well (James, 2017). There is a possibility of another argument in support of Cyber Warfare. Traditional wars are very long taking years to finish. A few examples are the Hundred Years War in the history of Europe. Other examples could be the First and Second World Wars, and the recent is War on Terror lasted for almost two decades. Cyber Warfare would not take that long if it happens in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Deterrence Theory During the time of the cold war, deterrence theory was the first preferred framework that analyze the military doctrine to elaborate on the influence of nuclear weapons and further argued that nuclear power and its consequences, such war (nuclear war) will not go to war with each other, and this also applied to the theoretical framework to cyberspace, as cyber deterrence.

The US Army analyzed that there is no difference between deterrence in the domain of cyberspace and any other domain. In cyber warfare, the theory of deterrence and its application leads to a series of conclusions for policy making (Askin, 1997).</p>\n    <p>As we know that \u201cCyber Weapons\u201d require a specific legal development, quick retaliatory cyber strikes are impossible. Therefore, due to the fact that the attribution requires, retaliation with cyber means cannot be done ad-hoc. Defense and offense must thus be joined into a broader deterrence strategy (Bendiek, & Metzger, 2015). In human beings' affairs the Deterrence of attack has a long history, so the relationship between the rise of a new kind of battlefield and a result it is necessary to discover a new strategy of a weapon for deterrence to acquire the applicability to Cyber War. The non-ending competition between the development of the new kind of weapons and their use, and the defensive response to them. In order to adjust deterrence theory to deal with the new form of threat of Cyber Warfare, which has started a new chapter in warfare. Cyber warfare has brought a new challenge to the international community (Lupovici, 2011).</p>\n    <p>The deterrence theory and its application to Cyber Warfare relate to ambiguity with this respect, at first recognition and attribution of an attack, and second the uncertain effect of any attack. The difficulty around the attribution and control of its impacts make the deterrence of Cyber Warfare unique and difficult. The implications of this uncertainty can show that there is a need for development to expand the ability to apply deterrence to Cyber Warfare.</p>\n    <p>There is an enormous implication of national security to Cyber Warfare. Which is now considered outer space, which is also recognized as a new battlefield. The dependency on the space-based platform in order to observe the actions of an enemy has increased with great power and communication with military forces of land-based. It is critical to secure rotating satellites in cyberspace, as well as provide targeting information to precisely guided munitions. To be sure, that the satellites are accessible to conventional targets, like space mines and missiles, as well as to direct energy munitions, like for example, particle beams and leaser (Carter, 1984).</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, a cyberattack that destroys these critical assets that link to control stations is a less expensive and less visible means to eliminate them. The electronic connection of it once incapacitated, any country would find that its military is seriously weakened for reconnaissance, it is reliant on satellites. navigation, and communication. In a conflict with a competitor, this effectively eliminates the using force. Not only does the legal distinction between peace and war apply to cyber warfare, but it also extends from the physical to the virtual realm. And the new challenges require a new kind of response. Those states that a few years ago were not considered the new technology are now using cyber technology to attack the world's most prominent nations by using viruses (Mosteanu, 2020).</p>\n    <p>These threat states are likely to move in order to plan security planning depending on anticipatory self-defense. Like defense for the interest of the nation is thoroughly rooted in International Law. Nations require in avoiding future threats and repelling those that are already ongoing, as long as their responses are reasonable to the threat and exclusively target those who are participating in such attacks. Anticipatory self-defense is more expansive and allows states to take precautionary actions without having to wait for an imagined threat to emerge (Mueller, Castillo, Morgan, Pegahi, & Rosen, 2006).</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 997, "completion_tokens": 789, "total_tokens": 1786}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

The member states of the UN have altered the Just War theory in order to maintain international peace (Chesterman, S, 2002). Still some countries have found ways to justify their aggressive actions against a weak states even in contemporary times. Some scholars and international organizations have produced concepts in just war theory that wrongfully justify the aforementioned conflicts, and over time these notions of \"responsibility to protect\" (Focarelli, C. 2008). \"humanitarian intervention,\" \"pre-emptive and preventive self-defense,\" and the \"unwilling or unable test\" have emerged. These concepts have costs and are not justified. Since just war theory has continued to evolve and may be modified in the future Just War Theory.</p>\n    \n    <p>As the growing scope of the internet has increasingly allowed people, government militaries, and organizations to work under the computer system. It also opens ways for actors to wage cyberattacks against all who use the internet. Today most of the national infrastructure, military system, government, and financial institutions operate by the digital system. The Just War Theory has played a big role in elevating the ethical and other use of new weapons throughout history, in this respect the theory of Cyber War is not different. The application of the Just War Theory to Cyber Warfare is greatly debated. Some scholars argued that the Just War Theory is irrelevant to Cyber Warfare. for considering morality, the Just War Theory is a useful tool applicable to Cyber War (Yates, 2013).</p>\n    \n    <p>Generally, conventional Warfare is being addressed by The International Treaties and Agreements to provide protection to innocent people and also to prevent extra damages to their properties. These rules and principles are known as International Humanitarian Law and are deeply contributed by Just War Theory (Evans, 2005). In recent few years, there has been much debates whether the existing system is effectively applied to cyber warfare, or it is some different concept from kinetic warfare.</p>\n    \n    <p>But the IHL and Just War Theory mostly focus on the intentions of the states, the results of attacks, and the means and methods through which the attack has brought. And this permits these customs to successfully be applied to a new concept of warfare, such as Cyber War. Although it is possible to bring these traditional guidelines into use, it still needed to be given to how perfectly the rules can be applied to Cyber Warfare. And this applicability of the rules needs to be elaborated/defined and accepted by the International Community in order to successfully regulate Cyber Warfare. As it has been stated that Cyber Warfare is a new kind of warfare and is considered a future threat to the world. Which is not addressed by any existing legal framework and there is a need for further interpretation in the present body of law (IHL) (Kaempf, & Tannock, 2018). So, in this article, the Cyber Warfare theory is related to my study which will be used to critique the contemporary apparatus of IHL as time is changing, and with the passage of time, the concept of war has also changed in the international domain.</p>\n\n    <h2>International Armed Conflict (IAC)</h2>\n    <p>The concept of armed conflict of international character is initially laid down in the Geneva Convention of 1949 and was developed in part to make the threshold of application a little more objective and factual and, therefore, remove the need for relatively and formal political recognition of a situation of war in the legal sense (Cullen, 2010). The situation of IAC happens when two or more sovereign states resort to the use of armed forces against each other. An armed conflict that takes place between a country and the international organization of another state also amounts to an Armed Conflict.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1000, "completion_tokens": 823, "total_tokens": 1823}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Conflicts occur between nation-states. IHL applies during international and non-international armed conflicts. Only a small portion of law applies, namely Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention 1949 of Additional Protocol II (Lysaght, 1983). Common article 3 is applicable to the armed conflict of not an international nature but took place on the territory of the state party, and this kind of conflict does not have to involve the military of the state but involves two or more armed groups.

Richard Baxter has written about the Vietnam War, he stated that though He added that, although it is easy to demonstrate that the US participation in the war has internationalized the conflict under Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions (1949), the entire law of war may be applicable. The International Court of Justice ruled in the Nicaragua case. \u201cThe conflict between the contras'' military and those of the Government of Nicaragua is an armed conflict which is 'not of an international character\u201d. The actions of the contras against the Nicaraguan government are thus governed by the law governing such conflicts, whereas the US actions against Nicaragua are governed by the law regulating international armed conflicts (Baxter, 1980).</p>\n\n<p>IHL appears today that applies to cyber operations which take place in the context of pre-existing and non-international armed conflicts. It is widely acknowledged that the idea of cyber war did not exist at the time when the most modern tools of International Humanitarian Law were being drafted, but this does not limit the application of IHL to such operations. The right of belligerents to choose techniques or means of combat has always been one of the most essential rules of IHL, the existing IHL explicitly anticipates that its rules and principles will be applied to newly developed ways and weapons of warfare. The context in which a means or method is used, not in its specific form, subjects it to the rules and principles of IHL (Melzer, 2011).</p>\n\n<p>The scope of combat in the cyber domain is demonstrated through cyber operations. IHL either applies to some extent or does not apply at all, or its applicability completely depends on where the issue is along with the conflict spectrum. Without a doubt, certain situations are more difficult to assess than others, the analysis is shown below. Any analysis of conflict classification considers that there must be some connection between the cyber operation or conduct of hostilities and the conflict for IHL to apply. In another way, if a cyber-attack occurs and is still related to armed conflict, IHL will not govern such conflicts. Unsurprisingly, there can be an important debate relating to the scope and nature of the conflict in the cyber domain. Looking at the conflict category under IHL through a cyber-lens poses several challenging concerns outside of that threshold relationship (Wallace, & Jacobs, 2019).</p>\n\n<p>It is a vital issue and matter to the international communities to take into consideration whether IHL (the Laws of War) is applicable in the domain of Cyber Warfare. A cyber-attack can be a Cyber Warfare if such an attack reaches the threshold of an armed conflict because the Laws of War (IHL) is deal only with the conflict of an international character and in certain situations with non-international or internal armed conflict (Bothe, Partsch, & Solf, 1982). It has been declared that an international armed conflict is an act of war or any other armed conflict that may take place between two or more sovereign states, as stated under Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, though one of the conflicting parties does not consider the situation to be a war.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 952, "completion_tokens": 740, "total_tokens": 1692}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

It is quite uncontroversial that when cyber operations are conducted in the context of an ongoing armed conflict then they are governed by the same IHL rules as that of conventional conflict, for example, if in similar or in addition to a bomb or missile attack, if a party to the conflict also brings a cyber-attack on the computer systems of its enemy, the IHL is applied both for the conventional attacks and cyber-attacks. The issue arises in respect of the applicability of IHL in a different cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>Even if the attack is initiated on a computer network that is not used by state employees, such activities could result in significant human tragedy, especially in the event of an armed war. There must be a reason to be cautious that cyber strikes will be used to interrupt the infrastructure necessary to supply essential resources and services to meet the basic requirements of the civilian. For example, vital connections such as electric power grids, nuclear plants, water plants, and systems for the delivery, oil refineries, gas and oil pipelines, financial systems, hospital systems, railroads, and control air traffic systems all are heavily dependent on computer and internet systems susceptible to access and operation by cyber operations. The high level of interconnectedness and dependency between civilian and military structures elevates the danger that civilians and civilian objects will be harmed due to the happening of Cyber Warfare (Diamond, 2014).</p>\n<p>Principles of IHL</p>\n<p>Principles of IHL which are applicable in times of war for protection of the civilian population are as under;</p>\n<p>Principle of Military Necessity</p>\n<p>The Law of Armed Conflicts is a part of international law restricting the harm and suffering caused by armed conflict.

When there is a situation of an armed conflict the only lawful purpose is to weaken the adversary\u2019s armed forces capabilities (Benvenisti, 2009).</p>\n<p>The modern law of armed conflict, therefore, with its strong humanitarian concern, necessarily requires a cautious difference between military and targeting civilians.

(Goodman, 2013),\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        It is always placing limitations on every military activity that are the more restrictive approach to the doctrine of military necessity, however, interpreting it as always employing restrictions on the actions of military forces, In the sense that no such actions may be undertaken (despite its legality under international Humanitarian Law) unless it is essential in terms of military sense.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        An attacking force, for example, may decide not to target certain opponent's military foundations that do not restrict its attack or would create a distraction from its primary goals.

Finally, \"military necessity\" is best described as the requirement, under any given set of circumstances, for the sake of military force to achieve justifiable military objectives (following the other principles of IHL) (Schmitt, 2016).\n    </p>\n    <h3>Principles of Distinction</h3>\n    <p>\n        The Laws of Armed conflict (IHL) rule of distinction means to protect those persons who are not participating in hostilities, specifically, common people. It is also intended to safeguard armed forces or combatants who have been subjected to illness, or as injured civilians. Protecting civilians in times of war has been provided under the rule distinction. Petersburg Declaration positively stated that the primary aim of war is to weaken the enemy state by attacking only its military forces.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        In Hague Regulations the rule was further provided, which prohibited launching an attack on \"towns, villages, dwellings or buildings which are undefined\" therefore being \"attack in the night\" there may be a huge possibility of targeting innocent civilians and combatants indiscriminately (Chengeta, 2016).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        The principle of distinction has now been included in the rules of war and it applies to both international and non-international armed conflicts. The Geneva Conventions' Additional Protocol I contains provisions concerning the rule of distinction. It also ensures that persons and their property are respected and protected in times of war. Parties to a conflict must differentiate between military objectives, as well as objects and military objects, and direct their attacks just against the military and their objectives, not civilians (Oswald, 2016). The population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of operations.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Principle of Proportionality</h3>\n    <p>\n        Under the principle of proportionality, an attack is restricted if \"there is a reasonable probability of causing incidental damages to civilian life, injury to people, or destruction to civilian property, which would be excessive about the material and direct military advantages expected\".\n    </p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 884, "completion_tokens": 764, "total_tokens": 1648}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ba606877f9"}}, "error": null}

Another issue in implementing the principle of proportionality would be determining whether the expected accidental damage to civilian objects is excessive in comparison to the expected military advantage (Dinstein, 2012).</p>\n<p>To be sure, balancing predictable harm to civilians or civilian objects against anticipated military advantage was and still is a challenge to the world, but in the case of Cyber Warfare, the difficulties, However, as suggested previously, it is uncertain which types of functional disruptions fall within the relevant harm category. Another challenge in implementing the proportionality principle is evaluating whether it is proportional to this. The challenge of estimating the scope of collateral damage that can be foreseen exacerbates the problem (Voigt, 2008). This is true both because cyber operations are a relatively new notion of warfare with well-known consequences and effects, and because the interconnected nature of cyberspace makes it difficult to anticipate all of the possible outcomes.</p>\n<p>Precautions required under IHL precautions must be preserved by the belligerents against the effects of attacks while directing an attack. The principle Precautions to be observed in the attack are needed by a general rule, which may be applied to all forms of military operations (Fenrick, 1982). To protect the individual from any kind of harm and their objects from damage constant care must be taken in this regard. And specific precautionary requirements were established by additional rules. Those planning or deciding to launch an attack should do everything possible to confirm that only military objectives are targeted and take all appropriate measures while identifying methods and means of warfare to prevent or, at the very least, limit civilian casualties. If there is a risk that the principle of precaution and proportionality will be violated, the belligerent must be required to avoid or avoid an attack (Cannizzaro, 2006).</p>\n<p>A party to an armed conflict, in the light of these rules, who is planning to direct a cyber-attack must do every plausible thing to gather the vital data of the state to verify that the planned attack is for the purpose of achieving a military objective and that the attack will not cause more damage to civilians. This may need bringing in technical specialists to identify the targeted system of a country and the systems to which it is associated, as well as the best manner to accomplish this object.

The duty to take necessary precautions against civilians and civilian objects in any attack to minimize loss or damages resulting from military operations requires that parties to an armed conflict keep military objectives separated from civilian population objectives to the maximum extent possible (Barber, 2010).</p>\n<p>While observing the principle of precautions, civilian and military infrastructure must have distinguished by belligerents targeting a state.

To put it another way, the Law of War must be followed by all parties involved in armed conflict. the parties to an armed conflict will responsible under IHL for such violations (Chinkin, 1994).</p>\n    <p>For example, Israel launched a military operation in Gazza Strip with the state that aim of suppressing rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas and other armed groups of Palestinian groups in 2008. This military operation ended in 2009 when both parties to the armed conflict declared a ceasefire. According to the United Nations and the Palestinian health ministry, this armed conflict had affected more civilians. Palestine reported more than 500 civilians and damage to public and private property. Civilians had paid the largest price in this armed conflict between Israel and Gazza and both the parties alleged serious violations of International Humanitarian Law. All parties are responsible and accountable for any violations of the Law of War, according to the principle of accountability.</p>\n    \n    <h3>Research Findings</h3>\n    <p>For a cyber-attack in order to qualify as one involving the requirement for the attacks as given under IHL, it must cause certain physical destruction or injury or death to a person as mentioned under the charter and IHL. However, in the age of warfare, physical destruction is less compared to kinetic warfare. Cyber-attacks will cause mere inconveniences i.e shut down the state system of many aspects like cause damage to economic structure, stealing data from banks one example is that shut down the New York Exchange for a week which resulted in the loss of an enormous amount of money which causes no tangible or visible damages (Castel, & Castel, 2016). So, it is reasonable to say that this research has found that IHL cannot assess the magnitude of damage in Cyber Warfare.</p>\n    <p>However, the consequences were far more serious than a single person's physical harm or injury. Similarly, the cyber-attack on Estonia shut down the banking websites with the view that the use of force could only be armed in nature (Hollis, 2007). A cyber-attack on the city of New York will not be considered a use of force. It is very hard to determine the sources of cyber-attack and is also an attribution problem.</p>\n    <p>This reality would provide many cyber-attacks with plausible deniability, especially as in many cases nations can credibly claim that the attacks may have started on their territory but were not initiated by their governments nor did the government authorize any group to initiate such an attack. Many cyber-attacks will not be harmful to civilian populations or to their objects, and many may not even cause permanent damage to physical objects. Another research finding is that it is hard to determine which conflict is international and non-international when it comes to Cyber Warfare. Here again, IHL is unable to determine the nature of the attack to exercise jurisdiction over it. The next research finding is that in Cyber Warfare proportionality cannot be determined or evaluated.

This chapter has concluded this research that a new treaty is required to focus on the control of Cyber Warfare.</p>\n    <p>For Sure, there are a lot of grey areas here (Cyber Warfare is basically one huge grey area), but labeling every hack as an act of Cyber War is at best ineffective, and at worst, it is scaremongering that could lead to dangerous development.</p>\n    <p>During my research on Cyber Warfare, Analyzing the existing situation of cyberspace and then discussing Cyber Warfare and the events that have occurred appeared to be difficult. Particularly, the potential for cyber warfare to occur in the international community, the limitations that existing international laws have imposed on cyber warfare, and, most importantly, the possible drawbacks of these laws. The focus of this research is, however, to collect relevant Cyber Warfare information and map it into a framework hence the governance aspects are still not covered.</p>\n    <p>The data collected could assist in understanding the boundaries that are crossed in cyber warfare and the misuse of cyberspace that is triggered by or results from international conflicts. Whereas superpower governments such as the United States and China appear to be working toward the formation of a new type of major power relationship, cyberspace collaboration should be a key component of that endeavor. Following the land, sea, air, and outer space as battlefields, cyberspace is becoming one of them.</p>\n    <p>The Internet has become a vital and crucial component of every state, society, and individual's daily life. Furthermore, it has gained momentum for future development. However, along with the conveniences that the Internet has provided, it has also brought with it a growing number of potential threats and concerns to the world computer system. Cyber Warfare incidents from the past were researched for this article, included are a number of prominent and publicized Cases of Cyber Warfare that involve states. Each case was investigated, analyzed, and documented using a framework similar to that used in kinetic warfare in the field of international conflict management. Each case study follows a general framework that begins with a brief background of the conflict in order to understand the parties involved. This research has shown to a large extent that the current IHL framework is insufficient to combat the threat of cyber warfare. therefore, a new treaty focusing on cyber-warfare must be established.</p>\n</div>"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 742, "completion_tokens": 564, "total_tokens": 1306}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_611b667b19"}}, "error": null}
