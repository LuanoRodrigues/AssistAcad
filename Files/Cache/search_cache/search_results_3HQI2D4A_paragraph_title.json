So let\u2019s assume that the US intelligence agencies have captured all network traffic to and from their suspects and have analyzed them down to the packet level. What would that reveal? If the adversaries are worth their money, very little. It\u2019s likely that Russian cybercapability is in a league with our own. Such being the case, the IP addresses, MAC addresses, and ISPs involved in the traffic are very unlikely to be traceable back to Putin, Russia, or the hackers themselves. If the perpetrators are \u201cA Team\u201d hackers, the traffic is more likely to trace back to a daycare center in Milan.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cBy way of background, let\u2019s profile a typical statesponsored cyberadversary. State sponsors have the most resources, and in all likelihood hire those with the strongest skillsets. We might include military cyberwarfare units like North Korea\u2019s Unit , China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Unit , Israel\u2019s Unit , the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the US National Security Agency, and so forth. It goes without saying that the Russians have similar agencies. In fact, all developed countries have operational cyberwarfare programs, under different auspices and of varying capabilities and budgets. In addition, we must include a coterie of government-financed private security companies (aka \u201cpure plays\u201d) for each of these agencies, not to mention a network of individual freelance hackers who also hire out their services.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cSuch cybermercenaries are well known and their activities well documented, thanks to whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and investigative journalists like James Bamford, and Tim Shorrock. Corporate players include Stratfor, HBGary/ManTech International, Gamma Group, the Equation Group, Cellebrite, and HackingTeam, to name but a few. The point to bear in mind is that in addition to their own internal apparatuses, state sponsors of cybercrimes, cyberterrorism, and cybersurveillance have a wide variety of private cybermercenary support at their disposal as well. In addition, there\u2019s a multimillion-dollar grayware market for malware., US intelligence agencies even have a secret procedure to oversee the acquisition and retention of such malware called the Vulnerability Equities Process. But whether the source of the attack is a government agency, corporate cybermercenaries, or independent agents, the source is likely to be highly skilled.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cIn any case, state-sponsored cyberwarriors certainly have the technical capacity to identify adversaries biometrically. As I mentioned above, modern intelligence agencies have enormous resources to draw upon, including various cyberweapons merchants and others who provide a cornucopia of communication and media interdiction tools, rootkits, remote session hijacking tools, worms, viruses, zero-day exploits, and sundry other tools to spy on cyberadversaries in situ. That said, the other side has comparable access to such tools and are aware that these tools can be used against them. Rooting a journalists\u2019 computer is very different from rooting the computer of a highly skilled security specialist in the employ of a state sponsor. This is very much a case of cyber cat and mouse where neither has the predictably clear advantage. Could Western intelligence agencies root computers of state adversaries? Sure, but it\u2019s not very likely unless the target has a rookie asleep at the console.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 87)", "\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks. This reaffirmed that truth is a moving target for government agencies when it comes to preferred narratives.13 If this sounds like modern politics to you, it\u2019s not coincidental. The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cFor example, in the case of the FBI decryption of the San Bernardino terrorists\u2019 iPhone, the technical expertise needed to circumvent the device\u2019s encryption has been attributed to both Cellebrite and freelancers. It\u2019s worth noting that state sponsors have nearly endless cyberweapon resources, especially those intelligence agencies connected with the STONEGHOST network made up of the English-speaking Five Eyes countries (the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand).\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cThe fanfare surrounding the 6 January 2017 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the recent hack of the DNC15 seems to be inversely related to the reader\u2019s understanding of computing networks. To borrow a phrase from Columbia journalism professor Nicholas Lemann, this report was a \u201cgolden-brown wobbly souffl\u00e9 of speculation.\u201d There was no evidence produced, no data revealed, no forensics mentionedjust 13 pages of undocumented opinion by the same folks who claimed that the Soviets were four years away from building an atomic bomb the eve before they detonated one, the USSR would never place missiles in Cuba, China wouldn\u2019t get involved in the Korean War, North Vietnam attacked US forces in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and who failed to foresee both the Iranian revolution and the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. I have no idea whether Vladimir Putin and his cyber hit squad was behind the DNC hack. And based on the report under review, it\u2019s an open question whether the security agencies do either. Intelligence services hide behind the mantra that they can\u2019t disclose sensitive sources and methods, real or imagined. For want of a better term, we\u2019ll call this fantasy intelligence.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cAny forensics examiner worthy of the name would begin an investigation with the assumption that any adversary is every bit the examiner\u2019s equal in terms of proficiency. While this assumption might not hold true, it guides the examiner to first look for hardest evidence, rather than the easiest conclusion to reach. If the adversary lacks the examiner\u2019s skills, perhaps the investigation takes a bit longer. However, the most troublesome and fruitless investigations spring from a trail of missed clues. Such is the case with much of the cyberattribution proffered by government agencies and reported in the commercial media in response to the alleged recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by Russia. We\u2019ll return to this topic below.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 84)", "\u201cLet\u2019s consider for a moment what these \u201csensitive sources and methods\u201d might be. Here are a sampling of known knowns to digital forensics experts. First, suspected malware file hashes can be matched against any number of detection programs to identify usual suspects (www.virustotal.com is a good starting point). These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cThe recent survey of attribution challenges by Earl Boebert21 is to be recommended in this regard. As Boebert observes, the Internet infrastructure itself works against attribution. Network address translation, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, the triviality of spoofing IP and MAC addresses, the lack of source authentication in DNS registration, proxy servers, encryption, anonymizing services, and the like all work against justiciable cyberforensic attribution\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 87)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B407.99129999999997%2C333.91000000000025%2C548.9888000000001%2C342.33625000000023%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C321.9137500000003%2C548.9975499999999%2C330.34000000000026%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C309.9175000000003%2C548.9888000000001%2C318.3437500000003%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C297.9212500000003%2C548.9940499999999%2C306.3475000000003%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C285.92500000000035%2C548.9888%2C294.35125000000033%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C273.9287500000004%2C548.9800500000003%2C282.35500000000036%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C261.9325000000004%2C548.9748000000001%2C270.3587500000004%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C249.9362500000004%2C549.0054250000005%2C258.3625000000004%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C237.9400000000004%2C549.0001749999998%2C246.36625000000038%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C225.9437500000004%2C549.0019249999999%2C234.37000000000037%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C213.9475000000004%2C549.0019250000001%2C222.37375000000037%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C201.95125000000039%2C549.0036749999999%2C210.37750000000037%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C189.95500000000038%2C548.9748%2C198.38125000000036%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C177.95875000000038%2C549.0045500000003%2C186.38500000000036%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C165.96250000000038%2C548.9879250000001%2C174.38875000000036%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C153.96625000000037%2C548.9800500000001%2C162.39250000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C141.97000000000037%2C548.9888%2C150.39625000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C129.97375000000036%2C548.9756749999998%2C138.40000000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C117.97750000000035%2C548.9984249999997%2C126.40375000000036%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C105.98125000000034%2C548.9888%2C114.40750000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C93.98500000000034%2C548.9678%2C102.41125000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C81.98875000000034%2C548.994925%2C90.41500000000035%5D%2C%5B395.9863%2C69.99250000000033%2C548.9879249999997%2C78.41875000000034%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOn the network side, state actors routinely sniff all network traffic they can get their hands on\u2014including, as the disclosures concerning the NSA\u2019s bulk data collection programs revealed, information about private citizens not suspected of any crimes and without benefit of court order.

In addition, we must include a coterie of government-financed private security companies (aka \u201cpure plays\u201d) for each of these agencies, not to mention a network of individual freelance hackers who also hire out their services.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2285%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 85</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2285%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.99625%2C441.7137499999998%2C230.99549999999996%2C450.13999999999976%5D%2C%5B78%2C429.7174999999998%2C231.01475000000002%2C438.1437499999998%5D%2C%5B78%2C417.7212499999998%2C230.99112500000004%2C426.1474999999998%5D%2C%5B78%2C405.72499999999985%2C230.99374999999992%2C414.15124999999983%5D%2C%5B78%2C393.64625%2C230.99812499999996%2C403.7718%5D%2C%5B78%2C381.64625%2C231.00259999999997%2C391.7718%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C369.65000000000003%2C230.992975%2C378.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C357.65375000000006%2C230.99735000000007%2C366.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C345.6575000000001%2C231.00347500000004%2C354.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C333.6612500000001%2C231.00435000000007%2C342.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C321.66500000000013%2C231.00347500000004%2C330.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C309.66875000000016%2C231.00347499999998%2C318.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C297.6725000000002%2C230.99735000000007%2C306.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C285.6762500000002%2C231.00872500000006%2C294.1025000000002%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C273.68000000000023%2C230.98947499999994%2C282.1062500000002%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C261.68375000000026%2C231.00872500000014%2C270.11000000000024%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C249.68750000000026%2C230.998225%2C258.11375000000027%5D%2C%5B78.00185000000002%2C237.64625%2C231.00609999999998%2C247.7718%5D%2C%5B78.0001%2C225.65%2C231.00872500000003%2C234.07625%5D%2C%5B78.0001%2C213.65375%2C231.00259999999992%2C222.07999999999998%5D%2C%5B78.0001%2C201.6575%2C230.98685000000006%2C210.08374999999998%5D%2C%5B78.0001%2C189.64625%2C231.00145%2C199.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99895000000001%2C177.65%2C230.9918250000001%2C186.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99895000000001%2C165.65375%2C230.99620000000002%2C174.07999999999998%5D%2C%5B77.99895000000001%2C153.6575%2C231.00057500000005%2C162.08374999999998%5D%2C%5B77.99895000000001%2C141.66125%2C230.86320000000012%2C150.08749999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2285%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSuch cybermercenaries are well known and their activities well documented, thanks to whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and investigative journalists like James Bamford, and Tim Shorrock. Corporate players include Stratfor, HBGary/ManTech International, Gamma Group, the Equation Group, Cellebrite, and HackingTeam, to name but a few. The point to bear in mind is that in addition to their own internal apparatuses, state sponsors of cybercrimes, cyberterrorism, and cybersurveillance have a wide variety of private cybermercenary support at their disposal as well. In addition, there\u2019s a multimillion-dollar grayware market for malware., US intelligence agencies even have a secret procedure to oversee the acquisition and retention of such malware called the Vulnerability Equities Process.

Sure, but it\u2019s not very likely unless the target has a rookie asleep at the console.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2287%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 87</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B77.99625%2C633.6687499999998%2C219.00862500000002%2C642.0949999999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C621.6724999999998%2C218.998125%2C630.0987499999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C609.6762499999998%2C219.00162500000002%2C618.1024999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C489.67874999999975%2C219.00075000000004%2C498.10499999999973%5D%2C%5B66%2C477.6824999999998%2C219.0025%2C486.10874999999976%5D%2C%5B66%2C465.6862499999998%2C218.99637499999997%2C474.1124999999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C453.6899999999998%2C219.0025%2C462.1162499999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C441.69374999999985%2C219.001625%2C450.11999999999983%5D%2C%5B66%2C429.64625%2C219.00059999999996%2C439.7718%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C417.65000000000003%2C219.00060000000002%2C426.07625%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C405.65375000000006%2C218.99972499999993%2C414.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C393.6575000000001%2C219.00060000000002%2C402.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C381.6612500000001%2C218.99535000000003%2C390.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C369.66500000000013%2C219.00060000000002%2C378.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C357.66875000000016%2C219.00060000000002%2C366.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C345.6725000000002%2C219.01809999999998%2C354.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C333.6762500000002%2C219.0067249999999%2C342.1025000000002%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C321.68000000000023%2C219.00147499999997%2C330.1062500000002%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C309.68375000000026%2C218.99622500000004%2C318.11000000000024%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C297.6875000000003%2C218.99972499999993%2C306.11375000000027%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C285.6912500000003%2C218.9971%2C294.1175000000003%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C273.69500000000033%2C218.99360000000004%2C282.1212500000003%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C261.69875000000036%2C219.00060000000002%2C270.12500000000034%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C249.70250000000036%2C218.98485%2C258.12875000000037%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C237.64625%2C218.9996%2C247.7718%5D%2C%5B65.99709999999999%2C225.65%2C198.929725%2C234.07625%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks.

The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution.

These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 86</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2287%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90%2C141.64625%2C231.00974999999988%2C150.0725%5D%2C%5B78.00375%2C129.64625%2C231.01072499999998%2C139.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99860000000001%2C117.64999999999999%2C231.0011%2C126.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99860000000001%2C105.65374999999999%2C231.0011%2C114.08%5D%2C%5B77.99860000000001%2C93.65749999999998%2C231.00897499999994%2C102.08375%5D%2C%5B77.99860000000001%2C81.66124999999998%2C231.0011%2C90.08749999999999%5D%2C%5B77.99860000000001%2C69.66499999999998%2C231.00722500000003%2C78.09124999999999%5D%2C%5B242.99735%2C705.6675%2C395.99109999999985%2C714.09375%5D%2C%5B242.99735%2C693.67125%2C395.99985%2C702.0975%5D%2C%5B242.99734999999998%2C681.675%2C395.9902250000001%2C690.1012499999999%5D%2C%5B242.99734999999998%2C669.6787499999999%2C395.99985%2C678.1049999999999%5D%2C%5B242.99734999999998%2C657.6824999999999%2C395.99985%2C666.1087499999999%5D%2C%5B242.99734999999998%2C645.6862499999999%2C374.99284999999986%2C654.1124999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2287%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe recent survey of attribution challenges by Earl Boebert21 is to be recommended in this regard. As Boebert observes, the Internet infrastructure itself works against attribution.

anonymizing services, and the like all work against justiciable cyberforensic attribution\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

While this assumption might not hold true, it guides the examiner to first look for hardest evidence, rather than the easiest conclusion to reach. If the adversary lacks the examiner\u2019s skills, perhaps the investigation takes a bit longer. However, the most troublesome and fruitless investigations spring from a trail of missed clues. Such is the case with much of the cyberattribution proffered by government agencies and reported in the commercial media in response to the alleged recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by Russia. We\u2019ll return to this topic below.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 84)", "\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks. This reaffirmed that truth is a moving target for government agencies when it comes to preferred narratives.13 If this sounds like modern politics to you, it\u2019s not coincidental. The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cFaith-based attribution is a term used by security specialist Jeffrey Carr to denote nonscientific analysis that leads to untestable attribution to a security incident. Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don\u2019t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cLet\u2019s consider for a moment what these \u201csensitive sources and methods\u201d might be. Here are a sampling of known knowns to digital forensics experts. First, suspected malware file hashes can be matched against any number of detection programs to identify usual suspects (www.virustotal.com is a good starting point). These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cThe fanfare surrounding the 6 January 2017 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the recent hack of the DNC15 seems to be inversely related to the reader\u2019s understanding of computing networks. To borrow a phrase from Columbia journalism professor Nicholas Lemann, this report was a \u201cgolden-brown wobbly souffl\u00e9 of speculation.\u201d There was no evidence produced, no data revealed, no forensics mentionedjust 13 pages of undocumented opinion by the same folks who claimed that the Soviets were four years away from building an atomic bomb the eve before they detonated one, the USSR would never place missiles in Cuba, China wouldn\u2019t get involved in the Korean War, North Vietnam attacked US forces in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and who failed to foresee both the Iranian revolution and the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. I have no idea whether Vladimir Putin and his cyber hit squad was behind the DNC hack. And based on the report under review, it\u2019s an open question whether the security agencies do either. Intelligence services hide behind the mantra that they can\u2019t disclose sensitive sources and methods, real or imagined. For want of a better term, we\u2019ll call this fantasy intelligence.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2287%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.9966%2C405.65000000000003%2C231.01072499999998%2C414.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00035%2C393.64625%2C230.98834999999997%2C403.7718%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C381.65000000000003%2C231.00585%2C390.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C369.65375000000006%2C230.99710000000002%2C378.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C357.6575000000001%2C231.00847499999992%2C366.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C345.6612500000001%2C231.00585%2C354.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C333.66500000000013%2C230.9900999999999%2C342.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C321.66875000000016%2C231.00322499999993%2C330.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C309.6725000000002%2C231.00585%2C318.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C297.64625%2C231.000975%2C307.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C285.65000000000003%2C231.00797499999993%2C294.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C273.65375000000006%2C231.00185%2C282.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C261.6575000000001%2C230.9974749999999%2C270.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C249.66125000000008%2C230.9992249999999%2C258.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C237.66500000000008%2C230.99659999999992%2C246.09125000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C225.66875000000007%2C231.00185%2C234.09500000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C213.67250000000007%2C231.00884999999982%2C222.09875000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C201.67625000000007%2C231.0027249999999%2C210.10250000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C189.68000000000006%2C231.00185%2C198.10625000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C177.64625%2C231.00482499999993%2C187.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C165.65%2C230.99869999999999%2C174.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C153.65375%2C157.25539999999995%2C163.7718%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2287%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecurity experts David Clark and Susan Landau17 provide an overview of the attribution problem from a defensive perspective.

The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 86</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2285%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B408%2C369.64625%2C561.0121249999999%2C378.0725%5D%2C%5B408%2C357.65000000000003%2C560.9849999999998%2C366.07625%5D%2C%5B408%2C345.65375000000006%2C561.0051249999998%2C354.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B408%2C333.6575000000001%2C560.9946249999998%2C342.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B408%2C321.6612500000001%2C561.0103750000001%2C330.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B408%2C309.66500000000013%2C470.0808%2C319.7718%5D%2C%5B420%2C285.64625%2C532.4637499999999%2C294.0725%5D%2C%5B420%2C273.65000000000003%2C535.735375%2C282.07625%5D%2C%5B420%2C261.65375000000006%2C537.1668749999999%2C270.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B420%2C249.65750000000006%2C535.8736249999998%2C258.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B420%2C237.66125000000005%2C529.6969999999999%2C246.08750000000003%5D%2C%5B420%2C225.66500000000005%2C522.4213749999997%2C234.09125000000003%5D%2C%5B420%2C213.66875000000005%2C534.5584999999996%2C222.09500000000003%5D%2C%5B420%2C201.67250000000004%2C533.1541249999998%2C210.09875000000002%5D%2C%5B420%2C189.67625000000004%2C542.7082500000001%2C198.10250000000002%5D%2C%5B420%2C177.68000000000004%2C538.7794999999999%2C186.10625000000002%5D%2C%5B420%2C165.68375000000003%2C541.3992499999999%2C174.11%5D%2C%5B420%2C153.68750000000003%2C545.8267499999998%2C162.11375%5D%2C%5B420%2C141.69125000000003%2C543.7757500000002%2C150.1175%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2285%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFaith-based attribution is a term used by security specialist Jeffrey Carr to denote nonscientific analysis that leads to untestable attribution to a security incident. Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong.

These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists.

They accurately sum up the problem: \u201cAttribution is central to deterrence ... and the Internet was not designed with deterrence in mind.\u201d A more technical description is supplied by David Wheeler and Gregory Larsen.18 Taken together, these papers are notable for the absence of detailed strategies to provide justiciable, evidence-based cyberattribution. There\u2019s a reason for that: there is none. The most we have is informed opinion. And the intelligence agencies that offered such opinions concerning the recent alleged \u201cRussian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\u201d assesment15 have an exceedingly spotty reputation when it comes to such reports\u2019 accuracy.19,20\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 87)", "\u201cAttribution theory has been a staple of modern social psychology since Heider\u2019s seminal book. To be sure, there are refinements on the work. But, so far as I know, the refinements don\u2019t detract from the theoretical foundation. That said, the public and media have yet to fully appreciate attribution theory and sibling psychological phenomenaa critical flaw in this era of \u201cfake news.\u201d Is a feature of\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 84)", "\u201cAttribution theory is relevant to cyberattribution. It\u2019s commonly politically motivated. Anup Ghosh, CEO of Invincea, refers to this activity as a blame game. \u201cNonetheless, many private firms and security researchers are quick to reach a conclusion on who is behind an attack based on code and infrastructure re-use, as well as the tactics, techniques, and protocols (TTPs) they have previously ascribed to bad actors with cute names. The methods typically would not pass a court of law\u2019s evidentiary standards, but are good enough for Twitter.\u201d His point is well-taken. Politicians and the power elite find it very convenient to engage in this blame game as they seek to discredit adversaries, avoid responsibility for insecure practices and inept leadership, influence politics and elections, and exploit attribution biases in support of cherished big government programs. In the words of singersongwriter Bruce Hornsby, \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cFaith-based attribution is a term used by security specialist Jeffrey Carr to denote nonscientific analysis that leads to untestable attribution to a security incident. Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don\u2019t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cAny forensics examiner worthy of the name would begin an investigation with the assumption that any adversary is every bit the examiner\u2019s equal in terms of proficiency. While this assumption might not hold true, it guides the examiner to first look for hardest evidence, rather than the easiest conclusion to reach. If the adversary lacks the examiner\u2019s skills, perhaps the investigation takes a bit longer. However, the most troublesome and fruitless investigations spring from a trail of missed clues. Such is the case with much of the cyberattribution proffered by government agencies and reported in the commercial media in response to the alleged recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by Russia. We\u2019ll return to this topic below.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 84)", "\u201cThe fanfare surrounding the 6 January 2017 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the recent hack of the DNC15 seems to be inversely related to the reader\u2019s understanding of computing networks. To borrow a phrase from Columbia journalism professor Nicholas Lemann, this report was a \u201cgolden-brown wobbly souffl\u00e9 of speculation.\u201d There was no evidence produced, no data revealed, no forensics mentionedjust 13 pages of undocumented opinion by the same folks who claimed that the Soviets were four years away from building an atomic bomb the eve before they detonated one, the USSR would never place missiles in Cuba, China wouldn\u2019t get involved in the Korean War, North Vietnam attacked US forces in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and who failed to foresee both the Iranian revolution and the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. I have no idea whether Vladimir Putin and his cyber hit squad was behind the DNC hack. And based on the report under review, it\u2019s an open question whether the security agencies do either. Intelligence services hide behind the mantra that they can\u2019t disclose sensitive sources and methods, real or imagined. For want of a better term, we\u2019ll call this fantasy intelligence.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks. This reaffirmed that truth is a moving target for government agencies when it comes to preferred narratives.13 If this sounds like modern politics to you, it\u2019s not coincidental. The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cLet\u2019s consider for a moment what these \u201csensitive sources and methods\u201d might be. Here are a sampling of known knowns to digital forensics experts. First, suspected malware file hashes can be matched against any number of detection programs to identify usual suspects (www.virustotal.com is a good starting point). These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2287%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.9966%2C405.65000000000003%2C231.01072499999998%2C414.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00035%2C393.64625%2C230.98834999999997%2C403.7718%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C381.65000000000003%2C231.00585%2C390.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C369.65375000000006%2C230.99710000000002%2C378.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C357.6575000000001%2C231.00847499999992%2C366.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C345.6612500000001%2C231.00585%2C354.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C333.66500000000013%2C230.9900999999999%2C342.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C321.66875000000016%2C231.00322499999993%2C330.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C309.6725000000002%2C231.00585%2C318.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C297.64625%2C231.000975%2C307.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C285.65000000000003%2C231.00797499999993%2C294.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C273.65375000000006%2C231.00185%2C282.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C261.6575000000001%2C230.9974749999999%2C270.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C249.66125000000008%2C230.9992249999999%2C258.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C237.66500000000008%2C230.99659999999992%2C246.09125000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C225.66875000000007%2C231.00185%2C234.09500000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C213.67250000000007%2C231.00884999999982%2C222.09875000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C201.67625000000007%2C231.0027249999999%2C210.10250000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C189.68000000000006%2C231.00185%2C198.10625000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C177.64625%2C231.00482499999993%2C187.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C165.65%2C230.99869999999999%2C174.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C153.65375%2C157.25539999999995%2C163.7718%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2287%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecurity experts David Clark and Susan Landau17 provide an overview of the attribution problem from a defensive perspective.

Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don\u2019t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2285%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 85</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2284%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B319.63%2C273.64625%2C548.767125%2C282.0725%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C261.65000000000003%2C548.7758749999997%2C270.07625%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C249.65375000000003%2C548.7505%2C258.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C237.65750000000003%2C548.7837499999996%2C246.08375%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C225.66125000000002%2C548.7321249999997%2C234.0875%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C213.66500000000002%2C548.7601249999996%2C222.09125%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C201.66875000000002%2C548.7601250000001%2C210.095%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C189.6725%2C548.7793750000003%2C198.09875%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C177.67625%2C548.7487500000002%2C186.1025%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C165.68%2C548.7758749999999%2C174.10625%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C153.68375%2C548.76275%2C162.10999999999999%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C141.6875%2C548.7609999999997%2C150.11374999999998%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C129.69125%2C548.746125%2C138.11749999999998%5D%2C%5B319.63%2C117.69499999999998%2C367.0733749999999%2C126.12124999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2284%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAny forensics examiner worthy of the name would begin an investigation with the assumption that any adversary is every bit the examiner\u2019s equal in terms of proficiency. While this assumption might not hold true, it guides the examiner to first look for hardest evidence, rather than the easiest conclusion to reach. If the adversary lacks the examiner\u2019s skills, perhaps the investigation takes a bit longer. However, the most troublesome and fruitless investigations spring from a trail of missed clues. Such is the case with much of the cyberattribution proffered by government agencies and reported in the commercial media in response to the alleged recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by Russia.

This reaffirmed that truth is a moving target for government agencies when it comes to preferred narratives.13 If this sounds like modern politics to you, it\u2019s not coincidental. The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 86</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B242.99255000000002%2C153.76500000000036%2C384.00754999999987%2C162.19125000000034%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C141.76875000000035%2C383.9988%2C150.19500000000033%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C129.77250000000035%2C383.9821749999998%2C138.19875000000033%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C117.77625000000033%2C384.0092999999999%2C126.20250000000034%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C105.78000000000033%2C384.0092999999999%2C114.20625000000034%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C93.78375000000032%2C384.00667499999986%2C102.21000000000033%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C81.78750000000032%2C383.9988%2C90.21375000000033%5D%2C%5B230.99630000000002%2C69.79125000000032%2C384.00404999999984%2C78.21750000000033%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">\u201cLet\u2019s consider for a moment what these \u201csensitive sources and methods\u201d might be.

These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were

There\u2019s a reason for that: there is none. The most we have is informed opinion. And the intelligence agencies that offered such opinions concerning the recent alleged \u201cRussian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\u201d assesment15 have an exceedingly spotty reputation when it comes to such reports\u2019 accuracy.19,20\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 87)", "\u201cAny forensics examiner worthy of the name would begin an investigation with the assumption that any adversary is every bit the examiner\u2019s equal in terms of proficiency. While this assumption might not hold true, it guides the examiner to first look for hardest evidence, rather than the easiest conclusion to reach. If the adversary lacks the examiner\u2019s skills, perhaps the investigation takes a bit longer. However, the most troublesome and fruitless investigations spring from a trail of missed clues. Such is the case with much of the cyberattribution proffered by government agencies and reported in the commercial media in response to the alleged recent hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by Russia. We\u2019ll return to this topic below.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 84)", "\u201cFaith-based attribution is a term used by security specialist Jeffrey Carr to denote nonscientific analysis that leads to untestable attribution to a security incident. Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don\u2019t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 85)", "\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks. This reaffirmed that truth is a moving target for government agencies when it comes to preferred narratives.13 If this sounds like modern politics to you, it\u2019s not coincidental. The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard. We call this political deception. In cyberspace, the same phenomenon is called evidence-free accusation or faith-based attribution. The term faith-based may also be used to describe novice cybersecurity practices as well,14 and should probably be extended to all political narratives.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cThe fanfare surrounding the 6 January 2017 report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on the recent hack of the DNC15 seems to be inversely related to the reader\u2019s understanding of computing networks. To borrow a phrase from Columbia journalism professor Nicholas Lemann, this report was a \u201cgolden-brown wobbly souffl\u00e9 of speculation.\u201d There was no evidence produced, no data revealed, no forensics mentionedjust 13 pages of undocumented opinion by the same folks who claimed that the Soviets were four years away from building an atomic bomb the eve before they detonated one, the USSR would never place missiles in Cuba, China wouldn\u2019t get involved in the Korean War, North Vietnam attacked US forces in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and who failed to foresee both the Iranian revolution and the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. I have no idea whether Vladimir Putin and his cyber hit squad was behind the DNC hack. And based on the report under review, it\u2019s an open question whether the security agencies do either. Intelligence services hide behind the mantra that they can\u2019t disclose sensitive sources and methods, real or imagined. For want of a better term, we\u2019ll call this fantasy intelligence.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)", "\u201cLet\u2019s consider for a moment what these \u201csensitive sources and methods\u201d might be. Here are a sampling of known knowns to digital forensics experts. First, suspected malware file hashes can be matched against any number of detection programs to identify usual suspects (www.virustotal.com is a good starting point). These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were redacted.\u201d (Berghel, 2017, p. 86)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2287%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B89.9966%2C405.65000000000003%2C231.01072499999998%2C414.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00035%2C393.64625%2C230.98834999999997%2C403.7718%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C381.65000000000003%2C231.00585%2C390.07625%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C369.65375000000006%2C230.99710000000002%2C378.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C357.6575000000001%2C231.00847499999992%2C366.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C345.6612500000001%2C231.00585%2C354.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C333.66500000000013%2C230.9900999999999%2C342.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C321.66875000000016%2C231.00322499999993%2C330.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C309.6725000000002%2C231.00585%2C318.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B78.00335000000001%2C297.64625%2C231.000975%2C307.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C285.65000000000003%2C231.00797499999993%2C294.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99935%2C273.65375000000006%2C231.00185%2C282.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C261.6575000000001%2C230.9974749999999%2C270.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C249.66125000000008%2C230.9992249999999%2C258.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C237.66500000000008%2C230.99659999999992%2C246.09125000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C225.66875000000007%2C231.00185%2C234.09500000000006%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C213.67250000000007%2C231.00884999999982%2C222.09875000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C201.67625000000007%2C231.0027249999999%2C210.10250000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C189.68000000000006%2C231.00185%2C198.10625000000005%5D%2C%5B77.99934999999999%2C177.64625%2C231.00482499999993%2C187.7718%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C165.65%2C230.99869999999999%2C174.07625%5D%2C%5B77.99619999999999%2C153.65375%2C157.25539999999995%2C163.7718%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2287%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecurity experts David Clark and Susan Landau17 provide an overview of the attribution problem from a defensive perspective.

Carr sums this up nicely in a recent article: It\u2019s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method. Claims of attribution aren\u2019t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don\u2019t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2285%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Berghel, 2017, p. 85</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B77.99625%2C633.6687499999998%2C219.00862500000002%2C642.0949999999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C621.6724999999998%2C218.998125%2C630.0987499999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C609.6762499999998%2C219.00162500000002%2C618.1024999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSuch was the case with the 2014 Sony hack when FBI Director James Comey leveraged familiar \u201ctrust me\u201d</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZMEYD7ZS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C489.67874999999975%2C219.00075000000004%2C498.10499999999973%5D%2C%5B66%2C477.6824999999998%2C219.0025%2C486.10874999999976%5D%2C%5B66%2C465.6862499999998%2C218.99637499999997%2C474.1124999999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C453.6899999999998%2C219.0025%2C462.1162499999998%5D%2C%5B66%2C441.69374999999985%2C219.001625%2C450.11999999999983%5D%2C%5B66%2C429.64625%2C219.00059999999996%2C439.7718%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C417.65000000000003%2C219.00060000000002%2C426.07625%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C405.65375000000006%2C218.99972499999993%2C414.08000000000004%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C393.6575000000001%2C219.00060000000002%2C402.08375000000007%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C381.6612500000001%2C218.99535000000003%2C390.0875000000001%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C369.66500000000013%2C219.00060000000002%2C378.0912500000001%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C357.66875000000016%2C219.00060000000002%2C366.09500000000014%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C345.6725000000002%2C219.01809999999998%2C354.09875000000017%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C333.6762500000002%2C219.0067249999999%2C342.1025000000002%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C321.68000000000023%2C219.00147499999997%2C330.1062500000002%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C309.68375000000026%2C218.99622500000004%2C318.11000000000024%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C297.6875000000003%2C218.99972499999993%2C306.11375000000027%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C285.6912500000003%2C218.9971%2C294.1175000000003%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C273.69500000000033%2C218.99360000000004%2C282.1212500000003%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C261.69875000000036%2C219.00060000000002%2C270.12500000000034%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C249.70250000000036%2C218.98485%2C258.12875000000037%5D%2C%5B65.99810000000002%2C237.64625%2C218.9996%2C247.7718%5D%2C%5B65.99709999999999%2C225.65%2C198.929725%2C234.07625%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3HQI2D4A%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2286%22%7D%7D\">and \u201cif you only knew what I know\u201d claims to advance a variety of accusational frameworks.

The same sleight-of-hand tactics are used by political operatives. As we saw in the last election cycle, some politicians are quite comfortable making false claims knowing full well that they\u2019ll neither be critically examined nor held up to even a minimal evidentiary standard.

These programs for the most part use public databases. There\u2019s nothing sensitive about this information. Second, any malware can be statically reverseengineered by de-compilation or disassembly and searched for string signatures that betray anomalies or exploits. Again, no news here. Further, runtime debuggers can be used to dynamically determine linkages and runtime dependencies associated with suspected malware. File headers might reveal compile dates, mnemonics used, file sizes, version numbers, and so forth that provide circumstantial clues to program authors and sources. Of course, state-sponsored cyberunits have the best tools known for these purposes\u2014but even the best tools don\u2019t provide prosecutable evidence. The operative point is that there\u2019s nothing \u201csensitive\u201d about any of these information-gathering tools and tactics. They\u2019re well known and used worldwide by computer forensicists. The likelihood is that if all of these methods were disclosed to the public, no \u201csensitive\u201d information would be revealed if only personally identifiable information were
