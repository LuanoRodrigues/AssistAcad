At the same time, the Internet has become the communications backbone required for the functioning of modern societies and economic systems. Therefore, the nature and means of the military defense of these systems also have to change and become more flexible to adapt to these emerging threats. Above all, the nascent cyber defense mechanism of any state must be able to provide the national political leadership with answers regarding a number of critical questions: What is the origin of a cyberattack; where did it come from? Who is responsible? What is the recommended course of action, or response?\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 89)", "\u201cThe prevalence and risk of cyberattacks continue to rise in parallel with our increasing reliance on the Internet for systems of economic production, supply and distribution chains, finance, power, transportation, and other critical infrastructures. Cyber warfare is becoming the next serious threat to national security1 that can impact not only life and property but also financial markets.2 According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the total number of cyber-attacks against government agencies, defense and high-tech companies, or economic crimes with losses of over one million dollars rose from 21 in 2014 to 58 in 2017.3 This CSIS list, built on open-source data only, depicts a worrisome trend of rising cyberattacks attributed to state-sponsored groups acting against the political or economic interests of other states.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 88)", "\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)", "\u201cThe demilitarization of cyberspace or a moratorium on the development of cyber weapons is no longer a possibility. However, nation states must come together to find common ground in cyber warfare starting with confidence-building measures, norms of behavior, and the applicability of international laws to reduce the possibility of a major catastrophic incident. Formal information sharing (both at CERT and diplomatic levels) and establishing hotlines will help deescalate future cyber incidents. There needs to be consensus building at the United Nations and other established international bodies such as the Office of Security and Cooperation (OSCE) to find ways of building consensus among nation states on preventing cyber conflicts and building confidence.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)", "\u201cDespite the inherent anonymity of the Internet, users leave traces of their activities along the way. These traces can provide valuable clues that can reveal the identity of the attackers and their possible motivations. The goal of digital forensics is to collect the traces, connect the dots, and make inferences about the incident, including identifying the perpetrators, determining the mechanism of operation, and cataloging the information compromised or altered. The tools, processes, and knowledge for digital forensics are freely available. Still, the anonymity of the Internet makes such analysis difficult, especially in the case of cyber warfare, where relevant information of the attack is hidden behind country firewalls and protected by the sponsors of the attack.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 90)", "\u201cThe tools and techniques of cyberattacks are common to \u201ccyber warfare,\u201d \u201ccyber terrorism\u201d and \u201ccyber activism.\u201d Only by analyzing the actors, modes of operation, and motivations behind attacks, and their intended or manifested targets, can one differentiate between the three. In contrast to conventional warfare, it is very difficult to distinguish whether attacks on a website or the online theft of data are attributable to individuals in another state who are motivated by financial gain, political or religious ideology, or actions taken by that state\u2019s intelligence agency or military (or their proxies). Since states may launch cyberattacks via proxies in other states, attribution difficulties are compounded, and present fundamental challenges during both conflict and peace times, when international cooperation and treaty compliance verification take hold.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "\u201cAll of these challenges make technical attribution for international cyber incidents difficult, though not impossible. It is still possible and has dramatically improved over the last few years through sustained intelligence efforts. In addition to data collected directly from ISPs and organizations, data can be collected through the use of honey pots and prepositioned data taps across global networks. Intelligence agencies are continuously monitoring the activities of known actors (including nation states). They are building intelligence dossiers that can be coupled with knowledge gained from digital forensics to make more definitive attributions.", "\u201cIn testimony delivered to the US Armed Services Committee in January 2017, James Clapper, former US Director of National Intelligence, stated that more than 30 nations were developing offensive cyberattack capabilities as of late 2016. He further opined that \u201cthe proliferation of cyber capabilities coupled with new warfighting technologies will increase the incidence of standoff and remote operations, especially in the initial stages of conflict.\u201d4 As policymakers warn of the dangers of cyber conflicts and exalt the virtues of cyber peace, most states consider cyberspace the fifth operational domain, with equal, or perhaps greater future importance to the traditional domains of land, sea, air, and space. State military and intelligence agencies continue to conduct cyber espionage and covert attacks on computer systems and networks in pursuit of strategic political or military objectives, both before and during conflicts. Yet, there is limited transparency on how states consider using their cyber capabilities, as only a few countries have publicly announced their cyber doctrines and underlying strategies. For example, McAfee, the global computer security software company, estimated in 2007 that over 120 countries were working on cyber commands,5 whereas D\u00e9vai listed 114 countries that, as of 2013, were developing civilian and military cyber capabilities, policies, doctrines and organizations at varying levels of maturity or focus.6 Considering that many of the officially declared \u2018defensive\u2019 cyber capabilities could easily be deployed in offensive cyber operations, as well as the fact that data assembled by cyber experts is often based on publicly available information only, it is not surprising that such estimations vary, and that the true state of cyber warfare preparedness and capabilities worldwide is difficult to ascertain. This high degree of uncertainty, when coupled with the low cost and easy acquisition of cyber weapons, ample and growing target selection, and multiplicity of types of attacks that may go unnoticed for a long time, contributes to a prevailing state of cyber insecurity in the international community. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that there is no commonly accepted terminology of critical cyber terms (e.g., \u2018cyber\u2019 vs. \u2018information\u2019 security) among key cyber actors, which affects the ability of most likely strategic adversaries to establish common ground as a prerequisite for dialogue.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 89)", "\u201cAttribution of cyberattacks is very important, especially to justify retaliatory actions against the perpetrators and prevent accidental retaliation against innocent targets. The entire domain of cyber norms and confidence-building measures is centered on visibility, i.e., being able to identify perpetrators of attacks and being able to ascertain adversarial strength. In the absence of such verification, the suspicion remains, and nation states assume the worst and prepare themselves by building stronger and stronger arsenals to maintain strategic equilibrium.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 90)", "\u201cAdditionally, digital forensics is constantly lagging behind the torrid pace of technological evolution, both in types of applications and devices, as well as in volumes of data.18 In the coming years, digital forensics will need to be able to contend with the extremely high volumes of data, as well as the sophisticated camouflaging techniques that are used in cyber warfare to become a credible factor in the attribution of cyber warfare activities. To be able to stay on course, we need to have an international forensics research institute for researching and updating forensics practices as information infrastructures evolve (e.g., connected vehicles, human-implantable devices, self-driving cars). We also need to train experts in each country on best practices (tools and techniques) in digital forensics so that they can conduct their investigations.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2289%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C289.37%2C391.31136%2C299.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C277.37%2C391.55136%2C287.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C265.37%2C391.55136%2C275.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C253.37%2C391.55136%2C263.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C241.37%2C391.48896%2C251.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C229.37%2C391.43136%2C239.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C217.37%2C391.2672%2C227.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C205.37%2C391.0876800000001%2C215.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C193.37%2C391.24519999999995%2C203.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C181.37%2C391.43136%2C191.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C169.37%2C391.1088000000002%2C179.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C157.37%2C391.55136%2C167.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C145.34%2C85.88256000000001%2C155.89999999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2289%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe boundary between conventional and cyber war is blurring as conventional defensive and offensive capabilities increasingly use the Internet for command, control, communications, and intelligence, making information and communication infrastructures and networks both the targets and vehicles of military attacks.

To be able to stay on course, we need to have an international forensics research institute for researching and updating forensics practices as information infrastructures evolve (e.g., connected vehicles, human-implantable devices, self-driving cars).

It suggests several initiatives to reduce chances of cyber conflict, as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.", "doi": "10.11610/Connections.19.1.08", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-improved-attribution-cyber-warfare-can-help/docview/2399871105/se-2?accountid=14511", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "87-95", "short_title": "", "item_id": "RMFZBFYI", "citation_key": "goelHowImprovedAttribution2020", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/Q2ZCWZ4E", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 286180}}], "keywords": ["#conventional_and_cyber_war #military_defense_adaptation #cyberattack_attribution #Goel #cyber_defense_mechanism", "#cyber_warfare #national_security_threat #rising_cyberattacks #Centre_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies #Goel", "#cyber_warfare #nation-state_attacks #cyber_incident_attribution #confidence_building_measures #international_law #Goel #forensic_analytics_capabilities", "#demilitarization_of_cyberspace #cyber_warfare #confidence-building_measures #United_Nations #Office_of_Security_and_Cooperation #norms_of_behavior #international_laws", "#Internet_anonymity #digital_forensics #cyber_warfare #Goel #traces_collection #inference_making", "#cyber_warfare #cyber_terrorism #cyber_activism #Goel #attribution_difficulties", "#technical_attribution #international_cyber_incidents #intelligence_efforts #digital_forensics #intelligence_dossiers", "#cyberattack_capabilities #cyber_conflicts #cyber_espionage #cyber_warfare_preparedness #cyber_insecurity #James_Clapper #US_Armed_Services_Committee #McAfee #D\u00e9vai #cyber_doctrines #cyber_strategies", "#cyberattack_attribution #retaliatory_actions #cyber_norms #confidence-building_measures #strategical_equilibrium #Goel #verification_process", "#digital_forensics #technological_evolution #cyber_warfare #Goel #international_forensics_research_institute #forensics_practices #camouflaging_techniques"], "score": [0.03225806451612903, 0.03159203980099502, 0.03125763125763126, 0.030776515151515152, 0.030536130536130537, 0.030117753623188408, 0.016666666666666666, 0.01639344262295082, 0.01639344262295082, 0.015873015873015872], "paragraph_id": [26003162, 61928899, 89224294, 55077964, 61987058, 82516006, 49419880, 87028259, 16144874, 63172460]}, "evidence OR cyber OR attribution ": {"section_title": ["Forensics and Attribution", "Forensics and Attribution", "Discussion", "Discussion", "Forensics and Attribution", "Conclusions"], "paragraph_title": ["Digital forensics plays a key role in attributing cyberattacks and informing national policy responses.", "Traceability of cyberattacks remains challenging, especially when proxies are involved.", "A Probabilistic Approach is Necessary for Attribution in Cyberattacks.", "Digital Forensics Must Evolve to Address Nation-State Cyberattacks.", "incident analysis is critical for understanding cyberattacks and preventing future breaches.", "Improved attribution and consensus among nations are essential to reduce cyber conflicts."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "Knowledge of previous events, tools, and techniques of known actors can be used to trace the origins of attacks. There is no automated analysis process; rather, analysts painfully evaluate evidence and make probabilistic judgments for assigning attribution. There are different levels of attribution, with each level becoming more difficult to assign attribution or point of origin (nation-state, hacker group), specific device (computer used to launch an attack), and an individual responsible for launching the attack. It is even harder to accurately pinpoint the sponsor of an attack, in cases where the hacker/group is working as a proxy.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 93)", "\u201cWe must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014. A hacker group calling itself the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d released confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee data, vast email and password files, internal documents and communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more. There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the North Korean government was behind the attack, given the similarity of the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans;19 the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians conducted the attack.20 There is no conclusive proof supporting either theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cAn equally important dimension of digital forensics is the detection of intrusion and post-incident analysis, whereby investigators need to understand how an attack was launched, what was stolen, damaged or changed, and how to prevent the attack from occurring in the future.16 This involves analyzing the internal logs of actors involved in the cyberattack and piecing together evidence from multiple sources into a single timeline of events. The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.424%2C207.05%2C388.617%2C217.61%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C195.05%2C388.574%2C205.61%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C183.05%2C388.551%2C194.39%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B51.024%2C577.42%2C391.551%2C587.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C565.42%2C391.434%2C575.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C553.42%2C391.14%2C563.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C541.42%2C391.214%2C551.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C529.42%2C391.301%2C539.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C517.42%2C390.99%2C528.76%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C505.42%2C391.431%2C515.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C493.42%2C391.295%2C503.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C481.42%2C391.232%2C491.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C469.42%2C391.431%2C479.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C457.42%2C391.108%2C467.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C445.42%2C391.431%2C455.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C433.39%2C391.431%2C443.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C421.39%2C391.311%2C431.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C409.39%2C391.551%2C419.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C397.39%2C391.365%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C385.39%2C83.668%2C395.95%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law.

The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2295%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B51.024%2C510.82000000000005%2C391.33743999999984%2C521.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C498.82%2C391.19328000000013%2C509.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C486.82%2C391.27776000000034%2C497.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C474.82%2C391.45343999999994%2C485.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C462.82%2C391.22888000000006%2C473.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C450.82%2C391.3131999999999%2C461.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C438.79%2C391.2787200000001%2C449.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C426.79%2C391.3672%2C437.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C414.79%2C391.40176%2C425.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C402.79%2C391.43136%2C413.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C390.79%2C391.3141599999999%2C401.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C378.79%2C391.2432000000001%2C389.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C366.79%2C391.55136%2C377.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C354.79%2C391.3535199999998%2C365.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C342.79%2C391.32304%2C353.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C330.79%2C391.49104%2C341.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C318.79%2C391.3643199999999%2C329.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C306.79%2C391.33744%2C317.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C294.77000000000004%2C391.31904000000014%2C305.33000000000004%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C282.77000000000004%2C353.54512%2C293.33000000000004%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2295%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2295%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 95</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Sanjay Goel", "date": "2020", "journal": "Connections : The Quarterly Journal", "title": "How Improved Attribution in Cyber Warfare Can Help De-Escalate Cyber Arms Race", "abstract": "Cyber warfare is a critical component of nation-states' military arsenals, and a cyber arms race has emerged in the absence of international agreements (norms and confidence-building measures) to limit the use of cyber warfare.

The entire domain of cyber norms and confidence-building measures is centered on visibility, i.e., being able to identify perpetrators of attacks and being able to ascertain adversarial strength. In the absence of such verification, the suspicion remains, and nation states assume the worst and prepare themselves by building stronger and stronger arsenals to maintain strategic equilibrium.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 90)", "\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "\u201cDigital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices,12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion. Several pieces of relevant information can be used for tracing the activities of a person or a device, including IP-addresses domain names, and time stamps.15 These individual entries in different log files can be time-correlated to create a chain of evidence and demonstrate activity emanating from a specific source.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cThe boundary between conventional and cyber war is blurring as conventional defensive and offensive capabilities increasingly use the Internet for command, control, communications, and intelligence, making information and communication infrastructures and networks both the targets and vehicles of military attacks. At the same time, the Internet has become the communications backbone required for the functioning of modern societies and economic systems. Therefore, the nature and means of the military defense of these systems also have to change and become more flexible to adapt to these emerging threats. Above all, the nascent cyber defense mechanism of any state must be able to provide the national political leadership with answers regarding a number of critical questions: What is the origin of a cyberattack; where did it come from? Who is responsible? What is the recommended course of action, or response?\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 89)", "\u201cAdditionally, digital forensics is constantly lagging behind the torrid pace of technological evolution, both in types of applications and devices, as well as in volumes of data.18 In the coming years, digital forensics will need to be able to contend with the extremely high volumes of data, as well as the sophisticated camouflaging techniques that are used in cyber warfare to become a credible factor in the attribution of cyber warfare activities. To be able to stay on course, we need to have an international forensics research institute for researching and updating forensics practices as information infrastructures evolve (e.g., connected vehicles, human-implantable devices, self-driving cars). We also need to train experts in each country on best practices (tools and techniques) in digital forensics so that they can conduct their investigations.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cAn equally important dimension of digital forensics is the detection of intrusion and post-incident analysis, whereby investigators need to understand how an attack was launched, what was stolen, damaged or changed, and how to prevent the attack from occurring in the future.16 This involves analyzing the internal logs of actors involved in the cyberattack and piecing together evidence from multiple sources into a single timeline of events. The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cThe demilitarization of cyberspace or a moratorium on the development of cyber weapons is no longer a possibility. However, nation states must come together to find common ground in cyber warfare starting with confidence-building measures, norms of behavior, and the applicability of international laws to reduce the possibility of a major catastrophic incident. Formal information sharing (both at CERT and diplomatic levels) and establishing hotlines will help deescalate future cyber incidents. There needs to be consensus building at the United Nations and other established international bodies such as the Office of Security and Cooperation (OSCE) to find ways of building consensus among nation states on preventing cyber conflicts and building confidence.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)", "\u201cDespite the inherent anonymity of the Internet, users leave traces of their activities along the way. These traces can provide valuable clues that can reveal the identity of the attackers and their possible motivations. The goal of digital forensics is to collect the traces, connect the dots, and make inferences about the incident, including identifying the perpetrators, determining the mechanism of operation, and cataloging the information compromised or altered. The tools, processes, and knowledge for digital forensics are freely available. Still, the anonymity of the Internet makes such analysis difficult, especially in the case of cyber warfare, where relevant information of the attack is hidden behind country firewalls and protected by the sponsors of the attack.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 90)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2293%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C505.42%2C391.431%2C515.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C493.42%2C391.258%2C503.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C481.42%2C391.311%2C491.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C469.42%2C391.14%2C479.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C457.42%2C391.431%2C467.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C445.42%2C391.278%2C455.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C433.39%2C391.336%2C443.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C421.39%2C391.33%2C431.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C409.39%2C103.942%2C419.95%5D%2C%5B65.184%2C397.39%2C391.245%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C385.39%2C391.431%2C395.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C373.39%2C391.341%2C383.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C361.39%2C391.151%2C371.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C349.39%2C391.391%2C359.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C337.39%2C391.431%2C347.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C325.39%2C391.551%2C335.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C313.39%2C391.14%2C323.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C301.39%2C77.804%2C311.95%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2293%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAll of these challenges make technical attribution for international cyber incidents difficult, though not impossible.

The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2293%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C102.74%2C391.16839999999996%2C113.3%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C90.744%2C391.2038400000003%2C101.304%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C78.744%2C391.17216000000013%2C89.304%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C66.744%2C391.21912%2C77.304%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C54.744%2C391.55136%2C65.304%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2293%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques.

There is no automated analysis process; rather, analysts painfully evaluate evidence and make probabilistic judgments for assigning attribution. There are different levels of attribution, with each level becoming more difficult to assign attribution or point of origin (nation-state, hacker group), specific device (computer used to launch an attack), and an individual responsible for launching the attack. It is even harder to accurately pinpoint the sponsor of an attack, in cases where the hacker/group is working as a proxy.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 93)", "\u201cWe must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014. A hacker group calling itself the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d released confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee data, vast email and password files, internal documents and communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more. There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the North Korean government was behind the attack, given the similarity of the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans;19 the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians conducted the attack.20 There is no conclusive proof supporting either theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cAttribution of cyberattacks is very important, especially to justify retaliatory actions against the perpetrators and prevent accidental retaliation against innocent targets. The entire domain of cyber norms and confidence-building measures is centered on visibility, i.e., being able to identify perpetrators of attacks and being able to ascertain adversarial strength. In the absence of such verification, the suspicion remains, and nation states assume the worst and prepare themselves by building stronger and stronger arsenals to maintain strategic equilibrium.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 90)", "\u201cAn equally important dimension of digital forensics is the detection of intrusion and post-incident analysis, whereby investigators need to understand how an attack was launched, what was stolen, damaged or changed, and how to prevent the attack from occurring in the future.16 This involves analyzing the internal logs of actors involved in the cyberattack and piecing together evidence from multiple sources into a single timeline of events. The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "\u201cDigital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices,12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion. Several pieces of relevant information can be used for tracing the activities of a person or a device, including IP-addresses domain names, and time stamps.15 These individual entries in different log files can be time-correlated to create a chain of evidence and demonstrate activity emanating from a specific source.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2293%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C505.42%2C391.431%2C515.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C493.42%2C391.258%2C503.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C481.42%2C391.311%2C491.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C469.42%2C391.14%2C479.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C457.42%2C391.431%2C467.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C445.42%2C391.278%2C455.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C433.39%2C391.336%2C443.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C421.39%2C391.33%2C431.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C409.39%2C103.942%2C419.95%5D%2C%5B65.184%2C397.39%2C391.245%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C385.39%2C391.431%2C395.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C373.39%2C391.341%2C383.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C361.39%2C391.151%2C371.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C349.39%2C391.391%2C359.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C337.39%2C391.431%2C347.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C325.39%2C391.551%2C335.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C313.39%2C391.14%2C323.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C301.39%2C77.804%2C311.95%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2293%22%7D%7D\">Knowledge of previous events, tools, and techniques of known actors can be used to trace the origins of attacks.

The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.424%2C207.05%2C388.617%2C217.61%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C195.05%2C388.574%2C205.61%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C183.05%2C388.551%2C194.39%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B51.024%2C577.42%2C391.551%2C587.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C565.42%2C391.434%2C575.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C553.42%2C391.14%2C563.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C541.42%2C391.214%2C551.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C529.42%2C391.301%2C539.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C517.42%2C390.99%2C528.76%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C505.42%2C391.431%2C515.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C493.42%2C391.295%2C503.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C481.42%2C391.232%2C491.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C469.42%2C391.431%2C479.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C457.42%2C391.108%2C467.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C445.42%2C391.431%2C455.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C433.39%2C391.431%2C443.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C421.39%2C391.311%2C431.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C409.39%2C391.551%2C419.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C397.39%2C391.365%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C385.39%2C83.668%2C395.95%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 91</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C241.37%2C391.393%2C251.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C229.37%2C391.431%2C239.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C217.37%2C391.088%2C228.71%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C205.37%2C391.46%2C215.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C193.37%2C391.433%2C203.93%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDigital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices,12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion.

Several pieces of relevant information can be used for tracing the activities of a person or a device, including IP-addresses domain names, and time stamps.15 These individual entries in different log files can be time-correlated to create a chain of evidence and demonstrate activity emanating from a specific source.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cAn equally important dimension of digital forensics is the detection of intrusion and post-incident analysis, whereby investigators need to understand how an attack was launched, what was stolen, damaged or changed, and how to prevent the attack from occurring in the future.16 This involves analyzing the internal logs of actors involved in the cyberattack and piecing together evidence from multiple sources into a single timeline of events. The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 92)", "Knowledge of previous events, tools, and techniques of known actors can be used to trace the origins of attacks. There is no automated analysis process; rather, analysts painfully evaluate evidence and make probabilistic judgments for assigning attribution. There are different levels of attribution, with each level becoming more difficult to assign attribution or point of origin (nation-state, hacker group), specific device (computer used to launch an attack), and an individual responsible for launching the attack. It is even harder to accurately pinpoint the sponsor of an attack, in cases where the hacker/group is working as a proxy.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 93)", "\u201cDigital forensics can strip away some of the Internet\u2019s anonymity and narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the incident.10 Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity.

The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 95)", "\u201cWe must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014. A hacker group calling itself the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d released confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee data, vast email and password files, internal documents and communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more. There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the North Korean government was behind the attack, given the similarity of the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans;19 the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians conducted the attack.20 There is no conclusive proof supporting either theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2291%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C241.37%2C391.393%2C251.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C229.37%2C391.431%2C239.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C217.37%2C391.088%2C228.71%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C205.37%2C391.46%2C215.93%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C193.37%2C391.433%2C203.93%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDigital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices,12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion.

The evidence can be collected from hard drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data. Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored. Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of analysis.17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of responsibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2293%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65.184%2C505.42%2C391.431%2C515.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C493.42%2C391.258%2C503.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C481.42%2C391.311%2C491.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C469.42%2C391.14%2C479.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C457.42%2C391.431%2C467.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C445.42%2C391.278%2C455.98%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C433.39%2C391.336%2C443.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C421.39%2C391.33%2C431.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C409.39%2C103.942%2C419.95%5D%2C%5B65.184%2C397.39%2C391.245%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C385.39%2C391.431%2C395.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C373.39%2C391.341%2C383.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C361.39%2C391.151%2C371.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C349.39%2C391.391%2C359.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C337.39%2C391.431%2C347.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C325.39%2C391.551%2C335.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C313.39%2C391.14%2C323.95%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C301.39%2C77.804%2C311.95%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2293%22%7D%7D\">Knowledge of previous events, tools, and techniques of known actors can be used to trace the origins of attacks.

Still, when combined with additional information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security perspective, as Healey argued, knowing \u201cwho to blame\u201d can be more important than \u201cwho did it?\u201d11 A proper response to this question provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 91</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2295%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B51.024%2C510.82000000000005%2C391.33743999999984%2C521.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C498.82%2C391.19328000000013%2C509.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C486.82%2C391.27776000000034%2C497.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C474.82%2C391.45343999999994%2C485.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C462.82%2C391.22888000000006%2C473.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C450.82%2C391.3131999999999%2C461.38%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C438.79%2C391.2787200000001%2C449.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C426.79%2C391.3672%2C437.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C414.79%2C391.40176%2C425.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C402.79%2C391.43136%2C413.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C390.79%2C391.3141599999999%2C401.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C378.79%2C391.2432000000001%2C389.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C366.79%2C391.55136%2C377.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C354.79%2C391.3535199999998%2C365.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C342.79%2C391.32304%2C353.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C330.79%2C391.49104%2C341.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C318.79%2C391.3643199999999%2C329.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C306.79%2C391.33744%2C317.35%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C294.77000000000004%2C391.31904000000014%2C305.33000000000004%5D%2C%5B51.024%2C282.77000000000004%2C353.54512%2C293.33000000000004%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2295%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage, fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. Nation-state attacks are constantly growing both in terms of frequency of attacks and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2295%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 95</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQ2ZCWZ4E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2294%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.424%2C397.39%2C388.49567999999977%2C407.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C385.39%2C388.4649600000002%2C395.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C373.39%2C388.5388800000005%2C383.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C361.39%2C388.79136%2C371.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C349.39%2C388.67136%2C359.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C337.39%2C388.4121600000002%2C347.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C325.39%2C388.51480000000015%2C335.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C313.39%2C388.67136%2C323.95%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C301.39%2C388.4871999999999%2C312.73%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C289.37%2C388.60874000000007%2C300.71000000000004%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C277.37%2C388.67136%2C287.93%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C265.37%2C388.39104000000003%2C275.93%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C253.37%2C388.48607999999984%2C263.93%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C241.37%2C388.67136%2C251.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C229.37%2C388.4237600000003%2C239.92999999999998%5D%2C%5B48.264%2C217.37%2C82.46687999999997%2C227.92999999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2294%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014. A hacker group calling itself the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d released confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee data, vast email and password files, internal documents and communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more. There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the North Korean government was behind the attack, given the similarity of the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans;19 the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians conducted the attack.20 There is no conclusive proof supporting either theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FRMFZBFYI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2294%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Goel, 2020, p. 94</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Sanjay Goel", "date": "2020", "journal": "Connections : The Quarterly Journal", "title": "How Improved Attribution in Cyber Warfare Can Help De-Escalate Cyber Arms Race", "abstract": "Cyber warfare is a critical component of nation-states' military arsenals, and a cyber arms race has emerged in the absence of international agreements (norms and confidence-building measures) to limit the use of cyber warfare.

The objectives could be tactical or strategic.

It suggests several initiatives to reduce chances of cyber conflict, as well as to prevent cyber conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.", "doi": "10.11610/Connections.19.1.08", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/how-improved-attribution-cyber-warfare-can-help/docview/2399871105/se-2?accountid=14511", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "87-95", "short_title": "", "item_id": "RMFZBFYI", "citation_key": "goelHowImprovedAttribution2020", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/Q2ZCWZ4E", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 286180}}], "keywords": ["#cyber_warfare #military_objectives #hacking_tools #strategical_objectives #tactical_objectives #Goel #denial_of_service_attacks #social_engineering #malicious_software", "#cyber_warfare #national_security_threat #rising_cyberattacks #Centre_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies #Goel"], "score": [4.0, 2.0]}, "Digital Evidence AND Cyber Operations": {"paragraph_id": [56617295, 67711803, 18953552, 10863147, 61928899], "section_title": ["Forensics and Attribution", "Forensics and Attribution", "Discussion", "Introduction", "Introduction"], "paragraph_title": ["Digital forensics involves correlating data to reconstruct cyberattack timelines and origins.", "Digital forensics plays a key role in attributing cyberattacks and informing national policy responses.", "Digital Forensics Must Evolve to Address Nation-State Cyberattacks.", "Cyber warfare includes a spectrum of activities targeting military and political objectives.", "The rise in cyberattacks threatens national security due to increased reliance on the Internet."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cDigital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices, including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and mobile devices,12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion.

As a multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including technical forensics, human and signals intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the operationalization and practical evolution of a robust confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 91)", "\u201cDigital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have been deployed.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 94)", "\u201cCyber warfare is a broad term that refers to actions by nation-state actors (or other international organizations with mala fide intentions) to use hacking tools to achieve military objectives in another country.

The objectives could be tactical or strategic. The tactical objectives could be degrading the capability of an adversary both in the battlefield or in weapons development (e.g., Stuxnet) or espionage to collect intelligence. The strategic objectives could be the use of soft power such as propaganda to influence public opinion for regime change or altering the political outcomes of the election or hard power by leaving dormant malicious software in critical infrastructure to leverage during times of conflict.\u201d (Goel, 2020, p. 89)", "\u201cThe prevalence and risk of cyberattacks continue to rise in parallel with our increasing reliance on the Internet for systems of economic production, supply and distribution chains, finance, power, transportation, and other critical infrastructures.
