There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cWhen an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on. Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders\u2019s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B337.5%2C626.24%2C531.0011%2C636.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C614.24%2C531.0430000000001%2C624.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C602.24%2C530.9833999999997%2C612.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C590.24%2C531.0236999999998%2C600.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C578.24%2C530.9739000000002%2C588.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C566.24%2C531.0030000000003%2C576.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C554.24%2C531.0447000000005%2C564.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C542.24%2C530.9933000000001%2C552.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C530.24%2C530.9813999999999%2C540.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C518.24%2C531.0335999999999%2C528.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C506.24%2C530.9828%2C516.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C494.24%2C531.0235000000002%2C504.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C482.24%2C531.0015999999999%2C492.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C470.24%2C455.63169999999997%2C480.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSelective attribution is far more common than public attribution yet its vital role in infosec and cyber policy is often glossed over.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria.

CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition.

CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders\u2019s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B107.5541%2C260.578755%2C138.33016700000002%2C291.773544%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C278.24%2C313.71510000000006%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C266.24%2C313.71910000000014%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C254.24%2C313.689%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C242.24%2C313.69509999999997%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C230.24%2C313.6981000000001%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C218.24%2C313.73729999999995%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C206.24%2C313.71909999999997%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C194.24%2C313.69810000000024%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C182.24%2C286.9280999999999%2C192.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhen an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B325.5%2C483.417%2C484.74419999999964%2C491.616%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C470.24%2C530.997%2C480.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C443.7975%2C531.0020999999999%2C456.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C434.24%2C530.9916999999996%2C444.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C422.24%2C531.0126999999998%2C432.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C410.24%2C531.0046999999998%2C420.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C398.24%2C531.0026999999998%2C408.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C386.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C396.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C374.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C384.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C362.24%2C531.0049999999998%2C372.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C350.24%2C531.0306999999993%2C360.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C338.24%2C531.0214999999995%2C348.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C326.24%2C530.9916999999995%2C336.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C314.24%2C531.0009999999999%2C324.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C302.24%2C530.9816999999996%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C290.24%2C531.0126999999998%2C300.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C278.24%2C530.9926999999993%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C266.24%2C531.0041999999996%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C254.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C242.24%2C508.01269999999965%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B325.5017%2C227.79749999999999%2C531.0069000000004%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C218.24%2C531.0019%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C206.24%2C531.0239%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C194.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C182.24%2C531.0219000000001%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C170.24%2C531.0194%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C158.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C146.24%2C531.0019000000002%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C134.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C122.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C110.24%2C531.0026000000001%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C98.24%2C530.9789000000001%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C86.24%2C531.0018999999998%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C74.24%2C530.9802%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C62.24%2C531.0119000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C50.24%2C531.0009000000005%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C38.24%2C530.9717000000003%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them.

One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders\u2019s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cIn these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B337.5%2C302.24%2C530.9832999999999%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C275.7975%2C530.9879%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C266.24%2C530.9969000000001%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C254.24%2C531.0079000000002%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C242.24%2C530.9793999999999%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C230.24%2C530.9878999999999%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C218.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C206.24%2C531.0228999999999%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C194.24%2C530.9753%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C182.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C170.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C158.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C146.24%2C530.9959000000003%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C134.24%2C530.9885999999998%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C122.24%2C530.9869000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C110.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C98.24%2C531.0272%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C86.24%2C367.6288999999999%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B325.4989%2C71.7975%2C530.9972%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C62.24%2C531.0032000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C50.24%2C530.9979999999999%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C38.24%2C511.95419999999984%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders\u2019s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cIn these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack. Acme\u2019s executive team in Example B1 based its analytic judgment on information from the company\u2019s systems and their business instincts, while CyberDefenders in Example C1 founded its assessment in substantial part on technical information from its customers\u2019 systems.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B107.5541%2C260.578755%2C138.33016700000002%2C291.773544%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C278.24%2C313.71510000000006%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C266.24%2C313.71910000000014%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C254.24%2C313.689%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C242.24%2C313.69509999999997%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C230.24%2C313.6981000000001%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C218.24%2C313.73729999999995%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C206.24%2C313.71909999999997%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C194.24%2C313.69810000000024%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C182.24%2C286.9280999999999%2C192.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhen an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B337.5%2C302.24%2C530.9832999999999%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C275.7975%2C530.9879%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C266.24%2C530.9969000000001%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C254.24%2C531.0079000000002%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C242.24%2C530.9793999999999%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C230.24%2C530.9878999999999%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C218.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C206.24%2C531.0228999999999%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C194.24%2C530.9753%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C182.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C170.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C158.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C146.24%2C530.9959000000003%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C134.24%2C530.9885999999998%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C122.24%2C530.9869000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C110.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C98.24%2C531.0272%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C86.24%2C367.6288999999999%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B325.4989%2C71.7975%2C530.9972%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C62.24%2C531.0032000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C50.24%2C530.9979999999999%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C38.24%2C511.95419999999984%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders\u2019s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cIn these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack. Acme\u2019s executive team in Example B1 based its analytic judgment on information from the company\u2019s systems and their business instincts, while CyberDefenders in Example C1 founded its assessment in substantial part on technical information from its customers\u2019 systems.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B107.5541%2C260.578755%2C138.33016700000002%2C291.773544%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C278.24%2C313.71510000000006%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C266.24%2C313.71910000000014%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C254.24%2C313.689%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C242.24%2C313.69509999999997%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C230.24%2C313.6981000000001%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C218.24%2C313.73729999999995%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C206.24%2C313.71909999999997%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C194.24%2C313.69810000000024%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C182.24%2C286.9280999999999%2C192.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhen an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B337.5%2C302.24%2C530.9832999999999%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C275.7975%2C530.9879%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C266.24%2C530.9969000000001%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C254.24%2C531.0079000000002%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C242.24%2C530.9793999999999%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C230.24%2C530.9878999999999%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C218.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C206.24%2C531.0228999999999%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C194.24%2C530.9753%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C182.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C170.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C158.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C146.24%2C530.9959000000003%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C134.24%2C530.9885999999998%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C122.24%2C530.9869000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C110.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C98.24%2C531.0272%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C86.24%2C367.6288999999999%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B325.4989%2C71.7975%2C530.9972%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C62.24%2C531.0032000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C50.24%2C530.9979999999999%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C38.24%2C511.95419999999984%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of analytic attribution: \u25a0 Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators\u2019 entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria\u2019s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. \u25a0 Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information.

Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria\u2019s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a \u201cfly-in team\u201d of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. \u25a0 Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme\u2019s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. \u25a0 Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders\u2019s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers\u2019 systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers\u2019 systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B337.5%2C302.24%2C530.9832999999999%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C275.7975%2C530.9879%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C266.24%2C530.9969000000001%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C254.24%2C531.0079000000002%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C242.24%2C530.9793999999999%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C230.24%2C530.9878999999999%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.6989%2C218.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C206.24%2C531.0228999999999%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C194.24%2C530.9753%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C182.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C170.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C158.24%2C530.9988999999998%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C146.24%2C530.9959000000003%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C134.24%2C530.9885999999998%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C122.24%2C530.9869000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C110.24%2C530.9988999999999%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C98.24%2C531.0272%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.6988999999999%2C86.24%2C367.6288999999999%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B325.4989%2C71.7975%2C530.9972%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C62.24%2C531.0032000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C50.24%2C530.9979999999999%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.6972%2C38.24%2C511.95419999999984%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cConsider the following examples of public attribution: \u25a0 Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria.

Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cOn the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, \u201cDue to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.\u201d9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cIn these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack. Acme\u2019s executive team in Example B1 based its analytic judgment on information from the company\u2019s systems and their business instincts, while CyberDefenders in Example C1 founded its assessment in substantial part on technical information from its customers\u2019 systems.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)", "\u201cWhy might CyberDefenders engage in selective attribution? It could be for the same reason that Americious did\u2014to provide context for defenders to understand and assess the threat. It is also potentially good marketing, as a show of analytic prowess\u2014assuming, of course, that the analysis holds up. On the other hand, CyberDefenders has decided that disclosing the identities of the suspected perpetrators to its customers does not advance its interests. NDAs cannot prevent recipients from making unauthorized disclosures; all they can do is create disincentives. CyberDefenders may have assessed that, notwithstanding the NDAs it has with its customers, including perpetrator identities in its report would expose its sources and methods to undue risk, or that naming names in a report could expose CyberDefenders to especially bitter reprisal from #APT, should the report ever be made public.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim\u2019s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders\u2019s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation\u2019s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access\u2014and what it can do with them.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B107.5541%2C260.578755%2C138.33016700000002%2C291.773544%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C278.24%2C313.71510000000006%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B141.8191%2C266.24%2C313.71910000000014%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C254.24%2C313.689%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C242.24%2C313.69509999999997%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C230.24%2C313.6981000000001%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C218.24%2C313.73729999999995%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999999%2C206.24%2C313.71909999999997%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C194.24%2C313.69810000000024%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B108.42909999999998%2C182.24%2C286.9280999999999%2C192.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhen an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on.

Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust.

There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs.

It could be for the same reason that Americious did\u2014to provide context for defenders to understand and assess the threat. It is also potentially good marketing, as a show of analytic prowess\u2014assuming, of course, that the analysis holds up. On the other hand, CyberDefenders has decided that disclosing the identities of the suspected perpetrators to its customers does not advance its interests. NDAs cannot prevent recipients from making unauthorized disclosures; all they can do is create disincentives. CyberDefenders may have assessed that, notwithstanding the NDAs it has with its customers, including perpetrator identities in its report would expose its sources and methods to undue risk, or that naming names in a report could expose CyberDefenders to especially bitter reprisal from #APT, should the report ever be made public.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 8</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B265.5034%2C86.24%2C459.0016000000005%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B253.5034%2C74.24%2C458.98340000000024%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B253.5034%2C62.24%2C458.9816000000005%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B253.5034%2C50.24%2C459.00940000000037%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B253.5034%2C38.24%2C459.03310000000033%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical \u201cdots\u201d ready to be connected with other dots.

Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: \u25a0 Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. \u25a0 Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation\u2019s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company\u2019s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company\u2019s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO\u2019s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. \u25a0 Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cAll four actors draw on technical and other data to arrive at judgments about the perpetrator of an incident. Yet the evidentiary standards, estimative language for presenting attribution claims, target consumers, and ultimate aims of attribution are obviously quite different. These problems have prompted proposals for new institutions to carry out attribution as part of a standardized process.6,7 Attribution claims, moreover, can take varying levels of abstraction about the malicious actor\u2019s identity and can range from the relatively specific (\u201cUnit 61398 of the 3PLA\u201d or \u201cEvgeniy Bogachev\u201d) to the relatively generic (\u201cthree computers in China\u201d). The appropriate level of abstraction for an attribution claim depends on the goals served by making the attribution.8 If the goal is a criminal conviction, for example, attribution at the level of \u201cthree computers in China\u201d may not suffice. Additionally, some infosec practitioners dismiss the value of communicating their attribution judgments to customers.9\u201d (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75BWFZS9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B325.5%2C483.417%2C484.74419999999964%2C491.616%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C470.24%2C530.997%2C480.15%5D%2C%5B325.5%2C443.7975%2C531.0020999999999%2C456.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C434.24%2C530.9916999999996%2C444.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C422.24%2C531.0126999999998%2C432.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C410.24%2C531.0046999999998%2C420.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C398.24%2C531.0026999999998%2C408.15%5D%2C%5B332.70169999999996%2C386.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C396.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C374.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C384.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C362.24%2C531.0049999999998%2C372.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C350.24%2C531.0306999999993%2C360.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C338.24%2C531.0214999999995%2C348.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C326.24%2C530.9916999999995%2C336.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C314.24%2C531.0009999999999%2C324.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C302.24%2C530.9816999999996%2C312.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C290.24%2C531.0126999999998%2C300.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C278.24%2C530.9926999999993%2C288.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C266.24%2C531.0041999999996%2C276.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C254.24%2C531.0016999999999%2C264.15%5D%2C%5B332.7016999999999%2C242.24%2C508.01269999999965%2C252.15%5D%2C%5B325.5017%2C227.79749999999999%2C531.0069000000004%2C240.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C218.24%2C531.0019%2C228.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C206.24%2C531.0239%2C216.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019%2C194.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C204.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C182.24%2C531.0219000000001%2C192.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C170.24%2C531.0194%2C180.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C158.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C168.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C146.24%2C531.0019000000002%2C156.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C134.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C144.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C122.24%2C531.0019000000001%2C132.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C110.24%2C531.0026000000001%2C120.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C98.24%2C530.9789000000001%2C108.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C86.24%2C531.0018999999998%2C96.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C74.24%2C530.9802%2C84.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C62.24%2C531.0119000000001%2C72.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C50.24%2C531.0009000000005%2C60.15%5D%2C%5B332.7019000000001%2C38.24%2C530.9717000000003%2C48.15%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSelective Attribution: Pssst ...

Yet the evidentiary standards, estimative language for presenting attribution claims, target consumers, and ultimate aims of attribution are obviously quite different. These problems have prompted proposals for new institutions to carry out attribution as part of a standardized process.6,7 Attribution claims, moreover, can take varying levels of abstraction about the malicious actor\u2019s identity and can range from the relatively specific (\u201cUnit 61398 of the 3PLA\u201d or \u201cEvgeniy Bogachev\u201d) to the relatively generic (\u201cthree computers in China\u201d). The appropriate level of abstraction for an attribution claim depends on the goals served by making the attribution.8 If the goal is a criminal conviction, for example, attribution at the level of \u201cthree computers in China\u201d may not suffice. Additionally, some infosec practitioners dismiss the value of communicating their attribution judgments to customers.9\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSDJNY2QQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Grotto, 2020, p. 3</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Andrew Grotto", "date": "2020", "journal": "IEEE Security & Privacy", "title": "Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon", "abstract": "I propose a new co nceptualization of cyber attribution to provide a reference point for debate about the means and ends of attribution, appropriate evidentiary standards for attribution claim types, and the advisability of various proposals for encouraging more and better attribution.", "doi": "10.1109/MSEC.2019.2938134", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/deconstructing-cyber-attribution-proposed/docview/2345513860/se-2?accountid=14511", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "12-20", "short_title": "", "item_id": "SDJNY2QQ", "citation_key": "grottoDeconstructingCyberAttribution2020", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/75BWFZS9", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 125232}}, {"authors": "Andrew Grotto", "date": "2020", "journal": "IEEE Security & Privacy", "title": "Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon", "abstract": "I propose a new co nceptualization of cyber attribution to provide a reference point for debate about the means and ends of attribution, appropriate evidentiary standards for attribution claim types, and the advisability of various proposals for encouraging more and better attribution.", "doi": "10.1109/MSEC.2019.2938134", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/deconstructing-cyber-attribution-proposed/docview/2345513860/se-2?accountid=14511", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "12-20", "short_title": "", "item_id": "SDJNY2QQ", "citation_key": "grottoDeconstructingCyberAttribution2020", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/75BWFZS9", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 125232}}], "keywords": ["#selective_attribution #cyberattack_campaign #information_sharing #Americious_government #Rosaria #Acme_Widget_Corporation #CyberDefenders #Traffic_Light_Protocol_(TLP)_Red", "#attribution_claims #evidentiary_standards #malicious_actors_identity #Unit_61398 #Evgeniy_Bogachev #standardized_process"], "score": [3.5, 2.5]}}
