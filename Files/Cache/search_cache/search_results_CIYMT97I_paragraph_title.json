Except for serial killers and the odd career robber or serial arsonist, civilian law enforcement is not accustomed to approaching an attack-a crime-as part of a sequence; the officers who respond to our fictive attack will therefore not likely consider whether it may be part of a much larger attack sequence.260 This means the civilian law enforcement response to a coordinated, sequenced cyberterrorism attack would probably be discrete and isolated; officers in different locations would respond to incidents without realizing that they were, in fact, part of a single, larger attack.

A recent exercise conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security demonstrates this. In February 2006, more than three hundred participants from the American public and private sectors and from four other countries conducted a simulated cyberterrorism assault, called Cyber Storm, on U.S. government agencies and businesses.74 The attacks were meant to disrupt \"critical infrastructure,... leading to cascading effects\" within the participating countries' \"economic, societal, and governmental structures.75 The exercise revealed problems in coordination between the public and private sectors and between different agencies in the public sectors. It also showed that talented, determined attackers can inflict serious damage on components of the United States' infrastructure.76\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber Storm was intended to test how collaborating government agencies and private sector representatives would respond to cyberattacks.79 The exercise demonstrated that these cyberattacks can be launched with a fair degree of efficacy.80 The Cyber Storm report noted that while the \"good guy\" players were \"generally effective in addressing single threats/attacks ..... [p]layers were challenged when attempting to develop an integrated situational awareness picture and cohesive impact assessment across sectors and attack vectors.\"81' It also noted that improved \"processes, tools and technology\" would \"enhance the quality, speed and coordination of response,\" particularly for \"cascading attacks or consequences.82 The Cyber Storm report at least implicitly indicates that improvements are needed in interagency (and inter-sector) coordination, contingency planning, risk assessment, and definition of \"roles and responsibilities across the entire cyber incident response community.,83\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201cIt seems reasonable to continue this approach of treating cyberterrorists as criminals, even though cyberterrorism, unlike most traditional, real-world terrorism, can be committed remotely.100 For example, in the Cyber Storm exercise, three hackers operating from Germany contributed to the disruption of services in the United States.101 One might argue that this remote commission capacity warrants treating cyberterrorism differently-approaching it as an external, rather than an internal, threat to social order. To do that, we would have to define \"remote\" cyberterrorism as something other than crime. 102 Alternatively, we could expand our definition of crime to encompass at least one type of external threat. 103\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 22)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97%2C537.113%2C413.8302%2C547.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C524.113%2C413.1303000000001%2C534.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C510.713%2C414.3999999999999%2C522.7347500000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C498.013%2C414.5964%2C508.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C485.513%2C415.558%2C495.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C472.513%2C413.9916%2C482.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C459.513%2C413.9975999999999%2C469.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C446.513%2C397.125%2C458.53475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a \"cyber saboteur,\" a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one \"No Fly\" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C473.213%2C434.983%2C483.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B96%2C460.113%2C436.3892%2C470.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C447.113%2C435.6%2C459.23475%5D%2C%5B96%2C433.713%2C435.50000000000006%2C443.813%5D%2C%5B96%2C420.713%2C436.0134%2C430.813%5D%2C%5B95%2C408.313%2C436.2467%2C418.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C395.013%2C435.4893000000002%2C405.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C382.013%2C436.3766%2C392.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C368.913%2C218.9774%2C378.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace.

Arguably, one of the most effective ways to mount a weapon of mass disruption attack would be to structure outages or other interferences of essential services in a way that dramatically demonstrates that these systems are now under the control of some anonymous, hostile agency.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201cThe Rome Labs case illustrates how and why the use of cyberspace can make attacker-attribution more difficult. Cyberspace erodes law enforcement's ability to assume that an attacker is parochial. The viability of that default assumption still holds for real-world crime, and can also hold for real-world terrorism, but its applicability to online crime and terrorism is increasingly problematic.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 38)", "\u201c[T]he intruders retained an ability to keep coming back into our systems, even ...a.s our cyber warriors tried ...to block.., them ...107 In the fall of 2006, the U.S. Air Force adopted a new mission statement in which it pledged to \"fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.\"108\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)", "\u201cAn analogous, but perhaps less serious, problem arises if the attack on our hypothetical corporate entity is cyberterrorism. Cyberterrorist attacks are unlikely to be isolated incidents; it is far more likely that a cyberterrorist event will be part of a sequence of attacks which may be separated spatially, temporally, and have different points of origin.259 Because the corporate attack we hypothesized above seems to be \"mere\" cybercrime, it would be dealt with by civilian law enforcement. Except for serial killers and the odd career robber or serial arsonist, civilian law enforcement is not accustomed to approaching an attack-a crime-as part of a sequence; the officers who respond to our fictive attack will therefore not likely consider whether it may be part of a much larger attack sequence.260 This means the civilian law enforcement response to a coordinated, sequenced cyberterrorism attack would probably be discrete and isolated; officers in different locations would respond to incidents without realizing that they were, in fact, part of a single, larger attack. As we saw above, the same could be true for cyberwarfare.261\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 60)", "\u201cThe same effect can be achieved, less dramatically, with cyberterrorist attacks that disrupt the functioning of infrastructure components. A recent exercise conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security demonstrates this.

Cyberterrorist attacks are unlikely to be isolated incidents; it is far more likely that a cyberterrorist event will be part of a sequence of attacks which may be separated spatially, temporally, and have different points of origin.259 Because the corporate attack we hypothesized above seems to be \"mere\" cybercrime, it would be dealt with by civilian law enforcement. Except for serial killers and the odd career robber or serial arsonist, civilian law enforcement is not accustomed to approaching an attack-a crime-as part of a sequence; the officers who respond to our fictive attack will therefore not likely consider whether it may be part of a much larger attack sequence.260 This means the civilian law enforcement response to a coordinated, sequenced cyberterrorism attack would probably be discrete and isolated; officers in different locations would respond to incidents without realizing that they were, in fact, part of a single, larger attack. As we saw above, the same could be true for cyberwarfare.261\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2260%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 60</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C283.213%2C434.6409000000003%2C293.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C269.913%2C434.89579999999995%2C280.113%5D%2C%5B95%2C257.713%2C434.9928%2C267.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B96%2C244.713%2C434.73620000000005%2C254.913%5D%2C%5B95%2C232.013%2C435.3264%2C242.113%5D%2C%5B95%2C219.013%2C434.9064%2C229.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C205.913%2C435.5958%2C218.03475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe same effect can be achieved, less dramatically, with cyberterrorist attacks that disrupt the functioning of infrastructure components.

To do that, we would have to define \"remote\" cyberterrorism as something other than crime. 102 Alternatively, we could expand our definition of crime to encompass at least one type of external threat. 103\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 22)", "\u201cThe same effect can be achieved, less dramatically, with cyberterrorist attacks that disrupt the functioning of infrastructure components. A recent exercise conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security demonstrates this. In February 2006, more than three hundred participants from the American public and private sectors and from four other countries conducted a simulated cyberterrorism assault, called Cyber Storm, on U.S. government agencies and businesses.74 The attacks were meant to disrupt \"critical infrastructure,... leading to cascading effects\" within the participating countries' \"economic, societal, and governmental structures.75 The exercise revealed problems in coordination between the public and private sectors and between different agencies in the public sectors. It also showed that talented, determined attackers can inflict serious damage on components of the United States' infrastructure.76\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber Storm was intended to test how collaborating government agencies and private sector representatives would respond to cyberattacks.79 The exercise demonstrated that these cyberattacks can be launched with a fair degree of efficacy.80 The Cyber Storm report noted that while the \"good guy\" players were \"generally effective in addressing single threats/attacks ..... [p]layers were challenged when attempting to develop an integrated situational awareness picture and cohesive impact assessment across sectors and attack vectors.\"81' It also noted that improved \"processes, tools and technology\" would \"enhance the quality, speed and coordination of response,\" particularly for \"cascading attacks or consequences.82 The Cyber Storm report at least implicitly indicates that improvements are needed in interagency (and inter-sector) coordination, contingency planning, risk assessment, and definition of \"roles and responsibilities across the entire cyber incident response community.,83\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97%2C537.113%2C413.8302%2C547.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C524.113%2C413.1303000000001%2C534.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C510.713%2C414.3999999999999%2C522.7347500000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C498.013%2C414.5964%2C508.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C485.513%2C415.558%2C495.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C472.513%2C413.9916%2C482.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C459.513%2C413.9975999999999%2C469.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C446.513%2C397.125%2C458.53475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a \"cyber saboteur,\" a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one \"No Fly\" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C473.213%2C434.983%2C483.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B96%2C460.113%2C436.3892%2C470.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C447.113%2C435.6%2C459.23475%5D%2C%5B96%2C433.713%2C435.50000000000006%2C443.813%5D%2C%5B96%2C420.713%2C436.0134%2C430.813%5D%2C%5B95%2C408.313%2C436.2467%2C418.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C395.013%2C435.4893000000002%2C405.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C382.013%2C436.3766%2C392.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C368.913%2C218.9774%2C378.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace.

Arguably, one of the most effective ways to mount a weapon of mass disruption attack would be to structure outages or other interferences of essential services in a way that dramatically demonstrates that these systems are now under the control of some anonymous, hostile agency.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201cHere, again, the importance of point of attack occurrence diminishes as attacks move online. A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them.

A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred.

Arguably, one of the most effective ways to mount a weapon of mass disruption attack would be to structure outages or other interferences of essential services in a way that dramatically demonstrates that these systems are now under the control of some anonymous, hostile agency.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201cBut the origin of the attack should not be the only focus of their investigation. When a \"personal\" attacker uses cyberspace, it, too, becomes a \"place\" of origin of the attack. Its role in the investigation of \"personal\" attacks is analogous to the role that a physical point of attack origin plays in the traditional investigative process. Cyberspace, like a real-world point of attack origin, becomes a source of inferential data that can be used to identify the attacker.'180 If, for instance, a stalker consistently uses a specific website in tormenting his victim, that website becomes \"a\" point of origin of the attack and should be treated as such.181 Even if the attacker has not revealed his identity to the site operator, his use of that particular website may provide inferential data as to his identity.182\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 40)", "\u201c[T]he intruders retained an ability to keep coming back into our systems, even ...a.s our cyber warriors tried ...to block.., them ...107 In the fall of 2006, the U.S. Air Force adopted a new mission statement in which it pledged to \"fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.\"108\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)", "\u201cThe same effect can be achieved, less dramatically, with cyberterrorist attacks that disrupt the functioning of infrastructure components. A recent exercise conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security demonstrates this. In February 2006, more than three hundred participants from the American public and private sectors and from four other countries conducted a simulated cyberterrorism assault, called Cyber Storm, on U.S. government agencies and businesses.74 The attacks were meant to disrupt \"critical infrastructure,... leading to cascading effects\" within the participating countries' \"economic, societal, and governmental structures.75 The exercise revealed problems in coordination between the public and private sectors and between different agencies in the public sectors. It also showed that talented, determined attackers can inflict serious damage on components of the United States' infrastructure.76\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)", "\u201cHere, again, the importance of point of attack occurrence diminishes as attacks move online. A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred. Cyberspace nullifies the influence of the three spatial dimensions that constrain action in the real-world and, in so doing, erodes the significance of place in attacker-attribution.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 51)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97%2C537.113%2C413.8302%2C547.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C524.113%2C413.1303000000001%2C534.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C510.713%2C414.3999999999999%2C522.7347500000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C498.013%2C414.5964%2C508.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C485.513%2C415.558%2C495.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C472.513%2C413.9916%2C482.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C459.513%2C413.9975999999999%2C469.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C446.513%2C397.125%2C458.53475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a \"cyber saboteur,\" a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one \"No Fly\" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C473.213%2C434.983%2C483.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B96%2C460.113%2C436.3892%2C470.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C447.113%2C435.6%2C459.23475%5D%2C%5B96%2C433.713%2C435.50000000000006%2C443.813%5D%2C%5B96%2C420.713%2C436.0134%2C430.813%5D%2C%5B95%2C408.313%2C436.2467%2C418.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C395.013%2C435.4893000000002%2C405.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C382.013%2C436.3766%2C392.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C368.913%2C218.9774%2C378.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace.

A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred. Cyberspace nullifies the influence of the three spatial dimensions that constrain action in the real-world and, in so doing, erodes the significance of place in attacker-attribution.\u201d</span>

In making this determination, investigators should factor the analog of the Willie Sutton rule into the calculus because, as we saw earlier, point of attack occurrence cannot itself sustain a finding of nation-state responsibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2252%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 52</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97%2C537.113%2C413.8302%2C547.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C524.113%2C413.1303000000001%2C534.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C510.713%2C414.3999999999999%2C522.7347500000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C498.013%2C414.5964%2C508.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C485.513%2C415.558%2C495.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C472.513%2C413.9916%2C482.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C459.513%2C413.9975999999999%2C469.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C446.513%2C397.125%2C458.53475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a \"cyber saboteur,\" a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one \"No Fly\" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C473.213%2C434.983%2C483.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B96%2C460.113%2C436.3892%2C470.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C447.113%2C435.6%2C459.23475%5D%2C%5B96%2C433.713%2C435.50000000000006%2C443.813%5D%2C%5B96%2C420.713%2C436.0134%2C430.813%5D%2C%5B95%2C408.313%2C436.2467%2C418.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C395.013%2C435.4893000000002%2C405.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C382.013%2C436.3766%2C392.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C368.913%2C218.9774%2C378.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace.

In February 2006, more than three hundred participants from the American public and private sectors and from four other countries conducted a simulated cyberterrorism assault, called Cyber Storm, on U.S. government agencies and businesses.74 The attacks were meant to disrupt \"critical infrastructure,... leading to cascading effects\" within the participating countries' \"economic, societal, and governmental structures.75 The exercise revealed problems in coordination between the public and private sectors and between different agencies in the public sectors. It also showed that talented, determined attackers can inflict serious damage on components of the United States' infrastructure.76\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)", "\u201cIt seems reasonable to continue this approach of treating cyberterrorists as criminals, even though cyberterrorism, unlike most traditional, real-world terrorism, can be committed remotely.100 For example, in the Cyber Storm exercise, three hackers operating from Germany contributed to the disruption of services in the United States.101 One might argue that this remote commission capacity warrants treating cyberterrorism differently-approaching it as an external, rather than an internal, threat to social order. To do that, we would have to define \"remote\" cyberterrorism as something other than crime. 102 Alternatively, we could expand our definition of crime to encompass at least one type of external threat. 103\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 22)", "\u201cThe Rome Labs case illustrates how and why the use of cyberspace can make attacker-attribution more difficult.

Arguably, one of the most effective ways to mount a weapon of mass disruption attack would be to structure outages or other interferences of essential services in a way that dramatically demonstrates that these systems are now under the control of some anonymous, hostile agency.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201cCyberwarfare is the conduct of military operations by virtual means.110 It consists of nation-states' using cyberspace to achieve the same ends that they pursue through the use of conventional military force: achieving advantages over a competing nation-state or preventing a competing nationstate from achieving advantages over them.111'\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 24)", "\u201cHere, again, the importance of point of attack occurrence diminishes as attacks move online. A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred. Cyberspace nullifies the influence of the three spatial dimensions that constrain action in the real-world and, in so doing, erodes the significance of place in attacker-attribution.\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 51)", "\u201cCyber Storm was intended to test how collaborating government agencies and private sector representatives would respond to cyberattacks.79 The exercise demonstrated that these cyberattacks can be launched with a fair degree of efficacy.80 The Cyber Storm report noted that while the \"good guy\" players were \"generally effective in addressing single threats/attacks ..... [p]layers were challenged when attempting to develop an integrated situational awareness picture and cohesive impact assessment across sectors and attack vectors.\"81' It also noted that improved \"processes, tools and technology\" would \"enhance the quality, speed and coordination of response,\" particularly for \"cascading attacks or consequences.82 The Cyber Storm report at least implicitly indicates that improvements are needed in interagency (and inter-sector) coordination, contingency planning, risk assessment, and definition of \"roles and responsibilities across the entire cyber incident response community.,83\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)", "\u201c[T]he intruders retained an ability to keep coming back into our systems, even ...a.s our cyber warriors tried ...to block.., them ...107 In the fall of 2006, the U.S. Air Force adopted a new mission statement in which it pledged to \"fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.\"108\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97%2C537.113%2C413.8302%2C547.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C524.113%2C413.1303000000001%2C534.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C510.713%2C414.3999999999999%2C522.7347500000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C498.013%2C414.5964%2C508.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C485.513%2C415.558%2C495.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C472.513%2C413.9916%2C482.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C459.513%2C413.9975999999999%2C469.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C446.513%2C397.125%2C458.53475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a \"cyber saboteur,\" a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one \"No Fly\" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brenner, 2007, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5L63L4J4%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B118%2C473.213%2C434.983%2C483.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B96%2C460.113%2C436.3892%2C470.113%5D%2C%5B96%2C447.113%2C435.6%2C459.23475%5D%2C%5B96%2C433.713%2C435.50000000000006%2C443.813%5D%2C%5B96%2C420.713%2C436.0134%2C430.813%5D%2C%5B95%2C408.313%2C436.2467%2C418.313%5D%2C%5B96%2C395.013%2C435.4893000000002%2C405.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C382.013%2C436.3766%2C392.013%5D%2C%5B96%2C368.913%2C218.9774%2C378.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCIYMT97I%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace.

Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them.

A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred.

When a \"personal\" attacker uses cyberspace, it, too, becomes a \"place\" of origin of the attack.

A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred. Cyberspace nullifies the influence of the three spatial dimensions that constrain action in the real-world and, in so doing, erodes the significance of place in attacker-attribution.\u201d</span>

It tells the investigators that the parochial-attacker assumption and derivative investigative approach that they use for real-world crime and terrorism will probably be of little use in identifying the attackers. When an attack presents functionally coterminous points of attack origin and occurrence, we have a localized crime scene that becomes the focal point of the investigation.

It tells the investigators that the parochial-attacker assumption and derivative investigative approach that they use for real-world crime and terrorism will probably be of little use in identifying the attackers. When an attack presents functionally coterminous points of attack origin and occurrence, we have a localized crime scene that becomes the focal point of the investigation. Evidence, inferences, observations of witnesses, and connections between victim and attacker all radiate from and revolve around this unitary crime scene. It creates a comprehensible focus for the investigation and, in so doing, makes the investigation a manageable task.

When a \"personal\" attacker uses cyberspace, it, too, becomes a \"place\" of origin of the attack. Its role in the investigation of \"personal\" attacks is analogous to the role that a physical point of attack origin plays in the traditional investigative process. Cyberspace, like a real-world point of attack origin, becomes a source of inferential data that can be used to identify the attacker.'180 If, for instance, a stalker consistently uses a specific website in tormenting his victim, that website becomes \"a\" point of origin of the attack and should be treated as such.181 Even if the attacker has not revealed his identity to the site operator, his use of that particular website may provide inferential data as to his identity.182\u201d (Brenner, 2007, p. 40)", "\u201cHere, again, the importance of point of attack occurrence diminishes as attacks move online. A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to \"inside\" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred.
