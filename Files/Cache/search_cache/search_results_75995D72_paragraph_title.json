The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25)", "\u201cBroad skills are required for attribution. Cyber threats have reached a high level of complexity. Both executing them and uncovering their architecture through attributive analysis requires a refined division of labour. A team of anti-virus researchers, for instance, can spend considerable time and energy reverse-engineering the installation mechanism of a specific piece of malware, while control engineers may focus on the particular design of a target-specific payload against an industrial plant. Stuxnet was so complex that particular companies focused their analysis on different aspects, such as the propagation mechanism, the command-and-control setup, or the payload targeting the industrial control system.15 As in a military context, an entire range of tactical activities lies beneath \u2014 but is vital to \u2014 operational considerations.

Successful attribution requires a range of skills on all levels, careful management, time, leadership, stress-testing, prudent communication, and recognising limitations and challenges.", "doi": "10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "4-37", "short_title": "", "item_id": "75995D72", "citation_key": "ridAttributingCyberAttacks2015", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/AZN6P3JU", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1655539}}], "keywords": ["#cyber_operations #precedents_analysis #industrial_control_systems #Rid_e_Buchanan #attribution_process", "#cyber_attack_damage #network_breach_costs #quantifying_cyber_damage #Shamoon_attack #Saudi_Aramco #Stuxnet #eBay #Nortel", "#cyber_threats_complexity #attributive_analysis #division_of_labour #tactical_activities #Stuxnet #Rid_e_Buchanan #reverse-engineering #control_engineers #specialisation"], "score": [4.0, 1.833, 1.5]}, "Evidentiary Standards AND International Court of Justice": {"paragraph_id": [3055073, 6991938, 81273940], "section_title": ["Part I", "Part III", "Part I"], "paragraph_title": ["Perception biases can affect attribution processes, leading to potential errors in judgment.", "Detailed indictments improve perception of government capability in attribution.", "Attribution primarily aims to identify organizations, though personal links can provide critical evidence."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cPerception also matters.

One of the most useful examples is CrowdStrike\u2019s Putter Panda report, published on 9 June 2014. One of the company\u2019s UK-based researchers, Nathaniel Hartley, first identified a malicious actor who was using the handle \u2018cpyy\u2019 in coordinated breaches. The next step was linking \u2018cpyy\u2019 to a real person. Hartley used registration data to connect the handle to Chen Ping. Now Chen, or \u2018cpyy\u2019, had to be connected to an organisation. Hartley uncovered more identifying information from various sources, including blogs and a Picasa photo album. Pictures in the folder \u2018office\u2019 clearly linked Chen aka \u2018cpyy\u2019 to a building in Shanghai, through various details in the images, including military hats, buildings, equipment, and even portraits of Chen. With the help of these photos, Hartley pinpointed a location: 31\u00b017\u02b917.02\u02b9N longitude 121\u00b027\u02b914.51\u02b9E, in the heart of the Zhabei District of Shanghai. The address represented the headquarters of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s (PLA) General Staff Department, 3rd Department, 12th Bureau, Unit 61486.20 Hartley\u2019s evidence combines multiple sources and is convincing.21 Other examples are Mandiant\u2019s APT1 report and, in a more limited sense, an exceptional Department of Justice indictment.22 All of these reports construct links between individuals and organisations via their online personas. On its own, such a personal link may not be sufficient for high-quality attribution. Yet credibly identifying an organisation may require first zooming down to persona level \u2014 and then zooming back out to organisational or unit level. This dynamic will depend on the available aperture. If the personal link aligns with other indicators from other sources, then the evidence can strengthen the case significantly.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 13)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.6299%2C588.581548%2C388.5341040000001%2C599.036434%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C576.38418%2C388.41355900000025%2C587.34318%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C564.669008%2C388.53410599999995%2C575.123894%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C552.5264400000001%2C388.42451100000005%2C563.48544%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C540.5701700000001%2C388.54287420000014%2C551.52917%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C528.6139000000001%2C388.45739400000014%2C539.5729%5D%2C%5B53.70378%2C516.65763%2C388.43547%2C527.61663%5D%2C%5B53.71474%2C504.902848%2C388.447962%2C517.5805752%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C492.946578%2C388.4150870000001%2C503.401464%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C480.74921%2C388.415086%2C491.70821%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C469.034038%2C388.40412799999984%2C479.488924%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C457.132568%2C388.5356360000001%2C467.587454%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C445.17629800000003%2C388.40412799999996%2C455.631184%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C433.220028%2C388.42604600000004%2C443.674914%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C421.263758%2C388.39316900000017%2C431.718644%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C409.30748800000003%2C388.535636%2C419.762374%5D%2C%5B53.69435%2C397.351218%2C262.12357099999997%2C407.806104%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cPerception also matters.

With the help of these photos, Hartley pinpointed a location: 31\u00b017\u02b917.02\u02b9N longitude 121\u00b027\u02b914.51\u02b9E, in the heart of the Zhabei District of Shanghai. The address represented the headquarters of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s (PLA) General Staff Department, 3rd Department, 12th Bureau, Unit 61486.20 Hartley\u2019s evidence combines multiple sources and is convincing.21 Other examples are Mandiant\u2019s APT1 report and, in a more limited sense, an exceptional Department of Justice indictment.22 All of these reports construct links between individuals and organisations via their online personas. On its own, such a personal link may not be sufficient for high-quality attribution. Yet credibly identifying an organisation may require first zooming down to persona level \u2014 and then zooming back out to organisational or unit level. This dynamic will depend on the available aperture. If the personal link aligns with other indicators from other sources, then the evidence can strengthen the case significantly.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2213%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 13</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "T Rid, B Buchanan", "date": "2015", "journal": "JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES", "title": "Attributing Cyber Attacks", "abstract": "Who did it?

The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25)", "\u201cBroad skills are required for attribution. Cyber threats have reached a high level of complexity. Both executing them and uncovering their architecture through attributive analysis requires a refined division of labour. A team of anti-virus researchers, for instance, can spend considerable time and energy reverse-engineering the installation mechanism of a specific piece of malware, while control engineers may focus on the particular design of a target-specific payload against an industrial plant. Stuxnet was so complex that particular companies focused their analysis on different aspects, such as the propagation mechanism, the command-and-control setup, or the payload targeting the industrial control system.15 As in a military context, an entire range of tactical activities lies beneath \u2014 but is vital to \u2014 operational considerations. Analysing the separate aspects requires vastly different skills \u2014 this specialisation is a firmly established principle in criminal investigations as well as in military operations: no commander would put IED-disposal units in charge of analysing the financing of insurgent networks, or the supply-chain of explosive devices. F-16 pilots do not choose their own targets. Missile engineers do not do nuclear strategy. In the context of cyber attacks, such elementary expectations have yet to form outside the small expert community engaged with attribution work.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 10)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.6199%2C146.19869000000003%2C388.4473900000001%2C157.15769%5D%2C%5B53.67186%2C134.483518%2C388.42547399999995%2C144.938404%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber operations are so new that \u2018firsts\u2019 are not uncommon.

The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25)", "\u201cBroad skills are required for attribution.

The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed.

Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material.

The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed.

Successful attribution requires a range of skills on all levels, careful management, time, leadership, stress-testing, prudent communication, and recognising limitations and challenges.", "doi": "10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "4-37", "short_title": "", "item_id": "75995D72", "citation_key": "ridAttributingCyberAttacks2015", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/AZN6P3JU", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1655539}}], "keywords": ["#cyber_operations #precedents_analysis #industrial_control_systems #Rid_e_Buchanan #attribution_process", "#cyber_attack_damage #network_breach_costs #quantifying_cyber_damage #Shamoon_attack #Saudi_Aramco #Stuxnet #eBay #Nortel", "#cyber_threats_complexity #attributive_analysis #division_of_labour #tactical_activities #Stuxnet #Rid_e_Buchanan #reverse-engineering #control_engineers #specialisation"], "score": [4.0, 1.833, 1.5]}, "Digital Evidence AND Cyber Operations": {"paragraph_id": [30264200, 16338194, 49972850, 91843986, 51432848], "section_title": ["Part II", "Part I", "Part I", "Part II", "Part II"], "paragraph_title": ["Probing the Outcomes of Attribution Process is Essential", "Aperture in intelligence refers to the scope of sources that inform an investigation.", "Broad skills and a division of labor are necessary to analyze the complexity of cyber threats.", "Life Insights Assist Attribution Processes", "Damage Insights Reveal Attacker Intentions"], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cCyber operations are so new that \u2018firsts\u2019 are not uncommon.

One of the most difficult elements in the attribution process is what many in the intelligence community call aperture: the scope of sources that can be brought to bear on a specific investigation, akin to the variable opening through which light enters a camera. The quality of attribution is likely to rise as the number of fruitful intelligence sources increases. Moreover, the significance of a wider aperture rises with the levels of the attribution process: opening the aperture on a specific incident on a purely technical level is possible, but only within narrow constraints. Digital forensic evidence generated by an intrusion is by definition limited in the context it provides. Exploit code rarely reveals motivation. On an operational and especially on a strategic level, other sources of intelligence may illuminate the wider picture, for instance intercepted telephone conversations or emails among those who ordered or organised an operation. The significance of all-source intelligence and of a wider aperture is one of the strongest reasons why states with highly capable intelligence agencies are better equipped to master the attribution process than even highly capable private entities.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 12)", "\u201cBroad skills are required for attribution. Cyber threats have reached a high level of complexity. Both executing them and uncovering their architecture through attributive analysis requires a refined division of labour. A team of anti-virus researchers, for instance, can spend considerable time and energy reverse-engineering the installation mechanism of a specific piece of malware, while control engineers may focus on the particular design of a target-specific payload against an industrial plant. Stuxnet was so complex that particular companies focused their analysis on different aspects, such as the propagation mechanism, the command-and-control setup, or the payload targeting the industrial control system.15 As in a military context, an entire range of tactical activities lies beneath \u2014 but is vital to \u2014 operational considerations. Analysing the separate aspects requires vastly different skills \u2014 this specialisation is a firmly established principle in criminal investigations as well as in military operations: no commander would put IED-disposal units in charge of analysing the financing of insurgent networks, or the supply-chain of explosive devices. F-16 pilots do not choose their own targets. Missile engineers do not do nuclear strategy. In the context of cyber attacks, such elementary expectations have yet to form outside the small expert community engaged with attribution work.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 10)", "\u201cModularity is one of the most prominent features of computer code. For reasons of efficiency, malicious actors will often avoid reinventing the wheel and will re-use software to accomplish basic tasks in their operations. As part of an attack, this software is frequently loaded directly on to the target networks, where it can later be analysed by investigators. Often, his software has its own signatures and hallmarks, which can provide insight into the identity of the intruders and their supporters. FireEye, a leading security company, illustrates as much with their report on so-called Digital Quartermasters. These are enabling entities that provide the same software to a range of affiliated malicious groups.36 This sort of analysis can vary in utility, depending on the case. Some code, packaged in modules, is so commonly used in intrusions that it ceases to be a very useful indicator for identifying an offender. Other code, like the underlying code for both the Stuxnet and Duqu malware, is so esoteric or complex as to be very useful in identification.37 In those investigations, researchers were reasonably certain that the authors of Stuxnet also authored Duqu, because the two pieces of malware shared some key modules and the code was not widely available.38\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber attacks are not created equal. The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.6199%2C146.19869000000003%2C388.4473900000001%2C157.15769%5D%2C%5B53.67186%2C134.483518%2C388.42547399999995%2C144.938404%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber operations are so new that \u2018firsts\u2019 are not uncommon.

For reasons of efficiency, malicious actors will often avoid reinventing the wheel and will re-use software to accomplish basic tasks in their operations. As part of an attack, this software is frequently loaded directly on to the target networks, where it can later be analysed by investigators. Often, his software has its own signatures and hallmarks, which can provide insight into the identity of the intruders and their supporters. FireEye, a leading security company, illustrates as much with their report on so-called Digital Quartermasters. These are enabling entities that provide the same software to a range of affiliated malicious groups.36 This sort of analysis can vary in utility, depending on the case. Some code, packaged in modules, is so commonly used in intrusions that it ceases to be a very useful indicator for identifying an offender. Other code, like the underlying code for both the Stuxnet and Duqu malware, is so esoteric or complex as to be very useful in identification.37 In those investigations, researchers were reasonably certain that the authors of Stuxnet also authored Duqu, because the two pieces of malware shared some key modules and the code was not widely available.38\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.62926%2C373.438688%2C388.42387400000007%2C383.893574%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C361.537208%2C388.45675299999994%2C371.992094%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C349.580938%2C388.45675299999994%2C360.035824%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C337.38356999999996%2C388.40195900000003%2C348.34256999999997%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C325.4273%2C388.4348370000001%2C336.3863%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C313.712138%2C388.4786770000001%2C324.16702399999997%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C301.51477%2C388.4567589999999%2C312.47377%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C289.799598%2C388.44579400000003%2C300.254484%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C277.843328%2C388.4348349999999%2C288.298214%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C265.941848%2C388.43483499999996%2C276.396734%5D%2C%5B53.69218%2C253.866648%2C388.450053%2C266.5444752%5D%2C%5B53.69644%2C241.910378%2C388.42813599999994%2C252.365264%5D%2C%5B53.69644%2C229.95410800000002%2C388.49389%2C240.408994%5D%2C%5B53.69644%2C217.980048%2C388.44718800000004%2C230.6578752%5D%2C%5B53.69357%2C206.02377800000002%2C388.4581430000001%2C216.478664%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber attacks are not created equal.

The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.6882%2C588.34045%2C388.4527720000001%2C599.29945%5D%2C%5B53.67724%2C576.625278%2C388.4060864%2C589.2970752%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C564.657148%2C388.4198990000002%2C575.112034%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C552.755678%2C388.430855%2C563.210564%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C540.55831%2C388.4746930000001%2C551.51731%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C528.843138%2C388.441814%2C539.2980239999999%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C516.864948%2C388.4364280000002%2C529.5428751999999%5D%2C%5B53.68281%2C504.908678%2C328.282473%2C515.363564%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.6299%2C588.581548%2C388.4135549999998%2C599.036434%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C576.625278%2C388.43547500000005%2C587.080164%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C564.42791%2C388.4464330000001%2C575.38691%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C552.7675380000001%2C388.42451600000004%2C563.222424%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C540.5701700000001%2C388.435473%2C551.52917%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C528.854998%2C388.402598%2C539.309884%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C516.65763%2C388.42451%2C527.61663%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C504.942458%2C388.3806800000001%2C515.397344%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C492.986188%2C388.39163900000005%2C503.441074%5D%2C%5B53.69282%2C480.978448%2C388.432261%2C493.65627520000004%5D%2C%5B53.68961%2C468.78108%2C388.43225600000005%2C479.74008%5D%2C%5B53.70056%2C456.87960999999996%2C388.41034599999995%2C467.83860999999996%5D%2C%5B53.70056%2C444.92334%2C388.5330828000001%2C455.88234%5D%2C%5B53.68961%2C433.208168%2C388.5374714%2C443.663054%5D%2C%5B53.68961%2C420.98294999999996%2C388.42275499999994%2C431.94194999999996%5D%2C%5B53.69106%2C409.267778%2C388.53234600000013%2C419.722664%5D%2C%5B53.69106%2C397.311508%2C388.46659200000005%2C407.766394%5D%2C%5B53.69106%2C385.355238%2C388.532346%2C395.810124%5D%2C%5B53.69106%2C373.398968%2C388.3898789999999%2C383.853854%5D%2C%5B53.69106%2C361.497498%2C113.89980600000001%2C371.952384%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cBroad skills are required for attribution.

The damage caused is one of the most important distinguishing features of a network breach. The damage of a cyber attack, in contrast to offences that involve physical violence, is almost always exceedingly difficult to pin down and to quantify. Damage falls into four broad sets: first, costs can be direct and immediate, for instance reduced uptime of servers that causes reduced availability of files, reduced integrity of data, or even hardware that is incapacitated by the intruders. One of the breaches with the highest immediate costs of this kind was the Shamoon attack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, which incapacitated 30,000 work stations in one go.65 Second, costs can be direct and delayed. Stuxnet manipulated Iranian nuclear centrifuges in such a way that stressed their components. Over a period of months if not years, a code-induced attrition campaign led to deliberate mechanical breakdowns.66 Costs, third, can also be indirect and immediate, for instance reputational damage or loss of confidentiality. An example is a massive breach at eBay, in which 145 million customer records were compromised.67 Finally costs can be indirect and delayed, for instance a loss of intellectual property that may result in improved market competition once a competitor has been able to utilise the exfiltrated material. One controversial example is the demise of Nortel, a Canadian networking equipment manufacturer.68 In general, the more indirect and the more delayed the costs, the harder it becomes to quantify them.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 25)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.6199%2C146.19869000000003%2C388.4473900000001%2C157.15769%5D%2C%5B53.67186%2C134.483518%2C388.42547399999995%2C144.938404%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber operations are so new that \u2018firsts\u2019 are not uncommon.

Successful attribution requires a range of skills on all levels, careful management, time, leadership, stress-testing, prudent communication, and recognising limitations and challenges.", "doi": "10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2014.977382", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "4-37", "short_title": "", "item_id": "75995D72", "citation_key": "ridAttributingCyberAttacks2015", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/AZN6P3JU", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1655539}}], "keywords": ["#cyber_operations #precedents_analysis #industrial_control_systems #Rid_e_Buchanan #attribution_process", "#cyber_threats_complexity #attributive_analysis #division_of_labour #tactical_activities #Stuxnet #Rid_e_Buchanan #reverse-engineering #control_engineers #specialisation", "#cyber_attack_damage #network_breach_costs #quantifying_cyber_damage #Shamoon_attack #Saudi_Aramco #Stuxnet #eBay #Nortel"], "score": [3.5, 2.0, 1.833]}, "Proof of Attribution AND Cyberspace": {"paragraph_id": [1231632, 91555816, 57077566, 23566558, 75943878, 2072336], "section_title": ["Introduction", "Conclusion", "Part I", "Introduction", "Conclusion", "Conclusion"], "paragraph_title": ["Attribution is crucial for state credibility and security.", "The sophistication of adversaries complicates the attribution process.", "Each level of attribution presents unique challenges and requires specific expertise.", "Attribution follows a systematic process akin to law enforcement.", "Attribution is an art requiring skills, resources, and political considerations.", "Attribution evolves slowly while retaining core characteristics amid change."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cAttribution is the art of answering a question as old as crime and punishment: who did it?

The web has evolved drastically since 1999; but the Internet has not. The net\u2019s underlying architecture is changing only slowly. Hence attribution is changing slowly as well \u2014 but it is evolving, and it is evolving in a contradictory fashion. On one hand, attribution is getting easier. Better intrusion detection systems could identify breaches in real-time, utilising more data faster. More adaptive networks could raise the costs of offensive action, thus removing clutter and freeing up resources to better identify high-profile breaches. More cyber crime could prompt improved law-enforcement cooperation even among unfriendly states, thus making state-on-state espionage both harder to hide and politically more costly.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 32)", "\u201cEach of the levels of the attribution process represents a discrete analytical challenge, relies on specific input data and specific expertise, and illuminates a separate aspect of successful attribution (see Figure 2). The analysis on each level needs to be informed and tempered by the others. Though the attribution process typically has a beginning and an end, the cycle does not necessarily follow a specific sequential or chronological order, as hypotheses are confronted with new details and new details give rise to new hypotheses in turn. Nevertheless, the layers represent separate tasks that, though they interrelate, will be analysed individually here. Usually so-called \u2018indicators of compromise\u2019 trigger the attribution process. Such indicators raise specific technical questions. More questions are likely to follow only after more facts have been gathered. On occasion, the attribution process may begin on the operational or strategic level. Sometimes the \u2018first knowers\u2019 of an incident will be above the technical level. Guided by non-forensic sources of intelligence, or by the broader geopolitical context \u2014 sometimes even by intuition \u2014 the possibility of malicious activity may be identified before technical indicators flag it, or indeed even before it begins. Attribution can go either way: the strategic and operational layers may inform the subsequent technical analysis, or vice versa.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 9)", "\u201cAttribution unwinds incrementally. These international incidents illustrate the potentially enormous stakes at play. But they are too exceptional and too confusing for a systematic discussion of attribution. Beginning with a more orderly and established illustration is more productive. In law enforcement, identifying a felon may begin with a report of a crime to an emergency phone operator. Next come investigators. The officers will secure the scene and interview witnesses. Forensic specialists will try to find and analyse specific artefacts, for instance matching a bullet found in the victim to a gun with fingerprints found at the crime scene. If all goes well, the evidence will be marshalled into a case presented to a jury, where the final question of attribution will be settled. Though often fraught with drama, it is a methodical, ordered, and institutionalised approach.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 5)", "\u201cThis study introduced a systematic model for attributing cyber attacks and articulated three core arguments: first, that attribution is an art: no purely technical routine, simple or complex, can formalise, calculate, quantify, or fully automate attribution. High-quality attribution depends on skills, tools, as well as organisational culture: well-run teams, capable individuals, hard-earned experience, and often an initial, hard-to-articulate feeling that \u2018something is wrong\u2019.85 The second argument was that attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process, not a problem that can simply be solved or not be solved. This process requires careful management, training, and leadership. The third argument was that attribution depends on the political stakes. The more severe the consequences of a specific incident, and the higher its damage, the more resources and political capital will a government invest in identifying the perpetrators. Attribution is fundamental: almost any response to a specific offence \u2014 law enforcement, diplomatic, or military \u2014 requires identifying the offender first. Governments get to decide how to do attribution, and they get to decide when attribution is good enough for action.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 31)", "\u201cBut attribution is also getting harder. Attackers learn from publicised mistakes. The rising use of strong cryptography is creating forensic problems and limiting the utility of bulk-collection. Hype and crises could obstruct nuanced communication. Attribution fatigue may set in. Indeed, absent meaningful consequences, states and non-state actors may simply lose their fear of getting caught, as a lax de-facto norm of negligible consequences emerges. Ironically this could mean that nondemocratic states become less concerned about getting caught than publicly accountable liberal democracies. Thus the discussion returns to our central starting point: the attribution process, a techno-political problem, is what states make of it \u2014 by investing time, resources, political capital, and by trying to outcompete their adversaries.\u201d (Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 33)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.6882%2C270.477648%2C388.4637320000001%2C280.932534%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C258.52137899999997%2C388.441814%2C268.97626499999996%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C246.56510999999998%2C388.419896%2C257.019996%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C234.42253799999997%2C388.4637320000001%2C245.38153799999995%5D%2C%5B53.688199999999995%2C222.70736699999998%2C226.48971199999988%2C233.16225299999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is the art of answering a question as old as crime and punishment: who did it?

Though often fraught with drama, it is a methodical, ordered, and institutionalised approach.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 5</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2230%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.6882%2C362.147088%2C388.50756799999994%2C372.601974%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C349.94971999999996%2C388.51852400000007%2C360.90871999999996%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C338.234548%2C388.507568%2C348.689434%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C326.278278%2C388.5075680000001%2C336.733164%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C314.322008%2C388.4089369999999%2C324.77689399999997%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C302.365738%2C388.4089369999999%2C312.820624%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C290.22317%2C388.3958980000001%2C303.1113752%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C278.477278%2C388.38493900000014%2C288.932164%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C266.521008%2C388.48357000000016%2C276.975894%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C254.56473800000003%2C388.48357000000004%2C265.019624%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C242.60846800000002%2C388.3630210000002%2C253.063354%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C230.4111%2C388.428775%2C241.37009999999998%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C218.695938%2C388.51644700000026%2C229.150824%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C206.739668%2C388.39589800000005%2C217.19455399999998%5D%2C%5B53.68612%2C194.59709%2C388.42877600000014%2C205.55608999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2230%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis study introduced a systematic model for attributing cyber attacks and articulated three core arguments: first, that attribution is an art: no purely technical routine, simple or complex, can formalise, calculate, quantify, or fully automate attribution. High-quality attribution depends on skills, tools, as well as organisational culture: well-run teams, capable individuals, hard-earned experience, and often an initial, hard-to-articulate feeling that \u2018something is wrong\u2019.85 The second argument was that attribution is a nuanced and multi-layered process, not a problem that can simply be solved or not be solved. This process requires careful management, training, and leadership. The third argument was that attribution depends on the political stakes. The more severe the consequences of a specific incident, and the higher its damage, the more resources and political capital will a government invest in identifying the perpetrators. Attribution is fundamental: almost any response to a specific offence \u2014 law enforcement, diplomatic, or military \u2014 requires</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAZN6P3JU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.6882%2C588.34045%2C388.529491%2C599.29945%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C576.625278%2C388.45277300000015%2C587.080164%5D%2C%5B53.6882%2C564.669008%2C84.822719%2C575.123894%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2231%22%7D%7D\">identifying the offender first.

Attackers learn from publicised mistakes. The rising use of strong cryptography is creating forensic problems and limiting the utility of bulk-collection. Hype and crises could obstruct nuanced communication. Attribution fatigue may set in. Indeed, absent meaningful consequences, states and non-state actors may simply lose their fear of getting caught, as a lax de-facto norm of negligible consequences emerges. Ironically this could mean that nondemocratic states become less concerned about getting caught than publicly accountable liberal democracies. Thus the discussion returns to our central starting point: the attribution process, a techno-political problem, is what states make of it \u2014 by investing time, resources, political capital, and by trying to outcompete their adversaries.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F75995D72%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rid e Buchanan, 2015, p. 33</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "T Rid, B Buchanan", "date": "2015", "journal": "JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC STUDIES", "title": "Attributing Cyber Attacks", "abstract": "Who did it?
