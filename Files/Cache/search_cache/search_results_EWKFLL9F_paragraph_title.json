In 2014 the Justice Department indicted7 five People\u2019s Liberation Army officers on economic espionage charges. Unsurprisingly, at least in part because the suspects could not be brought to trial in the United States and because the Chinese government understood that the threat of prosecution was empty,8 the attributions did not include evidentiary support, and the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FJA3THCZQ%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221043%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B135%2C652.401796875%2C486.1056%2C663.108%5D%2C%5B135%2C638.9617968749999%2C183.86424%2C651.0578399999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEWKFLL9F%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221043%22%7D%7D\">\u201ccyberattacks continued unabated, following additional indictments in 2017 and 2018.9\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEWKFLL9F%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221043%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2021, p. 1043</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FJA3THCZQ%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221055%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C611.9617968749999%2C486.03600000000006%2C622.6679999999999%5D%2C%5B135%2C598.401796875%2C485.964%2C610.49784%5D%2C%5B135%2C584.9617968749999%2C486.06000000000023%2C595.6679999999999%5D%2C%5B135%2C571.401796875%2C486.0359999999999%2C582.108%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999994%2C557.9617968749999%2C485.91720000000004%2C570.0578399999999%5D%2C%5B135%2C544.4017968750001%2C486.0840000000001%2C555.1080000000001%5D%2C%5B135%2C530.961796875%2C486.03600000000006%2C541.668%5D%2C%5B135%2C517.4017968750001%2C445.3441199999999%2C529.49784%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEWKFLL9F%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221055%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe law of State responsibility has long been an underdeveloped area of international law, even before layering on the cybersecurity context.63 The International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts are not codified, but many of its provisions reflect widely accepted customary international law.64 The Draft Articles provide helpful and adequate guidance on when States may attribute cyberattacks to another State, including in situations where a State has exercised \u201ceffective control\u201d over the cyber actions of a private actor.65\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEWKFLL9F%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221055%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2021, p. 1055</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FJA3THCZQ%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221063%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C652.401796875%2C486.1200000000001%2C663.108%5D%2C%5B135%2C638.9617968749999%2C485.9628000000001%2C649.6679999999999%5D%2C%5B135%2C625.401796875%2C486.07320000000016%2C636.228%5D%2C%5B135%2C611.9617968749999%2C486.15720000000005%2C622.6679999999999%5D%2C%5B135%2C598.401796875%2C424.9439999999999%2C610.49784%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEWKFLL9F%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221063%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDefining the range of cyber conduct that qualifies as \u201ccoercion\u201d has been more difficult.
