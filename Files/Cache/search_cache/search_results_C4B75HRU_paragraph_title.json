The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cSuch lack of clarity about states\u2019 actions is not unique to cyberattacks,163 but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.164\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 557)", "\u201cThe Council would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d285 The proposal contemplates that \u201c[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,\u201d286 and the Council can \u201cissue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,\u201d as well as \u201crule on damages\u201d that the perpetrator owes to the victim.287\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588)", "\u201cCyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.6 The technical side of attribution\u2014identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level\u2014has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)", "\u201cThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model. First, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \u201cattribution is nearly impossible.\u201d308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 591)", "\u201cFiguring out who\u2019s doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.1 Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.2 Another is insurance coverage.3 Invoking coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.4 Still other important examples involve cyberbased responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline5 to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)", "\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)", "\u201cNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,7 scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules of international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.8 But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.9 A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non\u2013cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.10 Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts\u2014an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.11 This results in a double challenge for those deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing lex generalis from the noncyberspace context is hard to do, and lex specialis governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized.12 At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 525)", "\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber \u00a0capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22587%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A67%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.1203179999999%2C282.1088280000001%2C475.1741280000007%2C292.39708800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C268.6089180000001%2C475.00064399999894%2C278.89717800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C255.10900800000005%2C475.1378939999994%2C265.39726800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C241.60909800000005%2C360.4671660000002%2C251.89735800000005%5D%2C%5B159.1203179999999%2C228.10918800000005%2C475.20267600000045%2C238.39744800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C214.60927800000005%2C475.2004800000007%2C224.89753800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C201.10936800000005%2C475.1906400000001%2C212.35992000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution.

These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22523%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22591%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A71%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C630.10716%2C475.20675000000045%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C616.60725%2C475.08487199999973%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C603.10734%2C475.2012600000008%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C589.60743%2C217.5500700000001%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B159.11999999999998%2C576.10752%2C475.278120000001%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C562.60761%2C475.13538000000074%2C572.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C549.1077%2C475.20345599999973%2C559.3959600000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C535.60779%2C475.24957199999966%2C545.8960500000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C522.10788%2C475.2309060000002%2C532.3961400000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999998%2C508.6079700000001%2C475.1430660000004%2C518.8962300000001%5D%2C%5B136.79985599999995%2C495.10716%2C475.31135999999935%2C506.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80015600000002%2C481.60725%2C475.10822999999965%2C491.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80015600000002%2C468.10734%2C252.34269600000027%2C478.3956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22591%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model. First, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that \u201cattribution is nearly impossible.\u201d308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22591%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 591</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22522%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120486%2C592.607208%2C475.16112000000044%2C602.895468%5D%2C%5B136.800342%2C579.107298%2C475.2313920000005%2C589.395558%5D%2C%5B136.80034199999997%2C565.607388%2C475.1819819999998%2C575.895648%5D%2C%5B136.80034199999997%2C552.10716%2C475.21345199999996%2C563.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79996999999997%2C538.60725%2C475.1245140000003%2C548.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79997%2C525.10734%2C475.1980799999998%2C535.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80106799999996%2C511.6074300000001%2C475.0970639999994%2C521.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80106799999996%2C498.1075200000001%2C475.1607480000004%2C508.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80106799999996%2C484.60716%2C475.41721800000005%2C495.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22522%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFiguring out who\u2019s doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.1 Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences.

Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors\u2014both governmental and nongovernmental\u2014yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)", "\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22587%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A67%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.1203179999999%2C282.1088280000001%2C475.1741280000007%2C292.39708800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C268.6089180000001%2C475.00064399999894%2C278.89717800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C255.10900800000005%2C475.1378939999994%2C265.39726800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C241.60909800000005%2C360.4671660000002%2C251.89735800000005%5D%2C%5B159.1203179999999%2C228.10918800000005%2C475.20267600000045%2C238.39744800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C214.60927800000005%2C475.2004800000007%2C224.89753800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C201.10936800000005%2C475.1906400000001%2C212.35992000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution.

And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22527%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.

"paragraph_text": ["\u201cThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary lex specialis, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.282 Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard\u2014including providing clarity about what\u2019s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior\u2014could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially mandating evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 586)", "\u201cThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses\u2014cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)", "\u201cFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)", "\u201cIf evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work\u2014domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as lex specialis on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky lex generalis of international law on evidence.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)", "\u201cFor the very high end of state action\u2014namely forcible self defense some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.248 For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ\u2019s suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.249 The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that \u201cthe graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.\u201d250\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 58)", "\u201cRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such \u201ctrust us\u201d attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because \u201ctrust us\u201d will only work with allies.217 And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 567)", "\u201cSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber \u00a0capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547)", "\u201cAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one\u2014a victim state need not announce that it has been attacked or identify the perpetrator.212 But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 566)", "\u201cSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of \u201ccyber CSI effect.\u201d224 Pursuant to the so-called \u201cCSI effect,\u201d the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties\u2019 practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states\u2019 expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors\u2014companies, governments, and academic experts\u2014to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution\u2019s credibility.252 Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)", "\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe Council would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d285 The proposal contemplates that \u201c[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,\u201d286 and the Council can \u201cissue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,\u201d as well as \u201crule on damages\u201d that the perpetrator owes to the victim.287\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588)", "\u201cFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic effects, supporting stability and helping to avoid conflict over cyberspace. Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571)", "\u201cDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement\u2019s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard\u2019s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580)", "\u201cTaken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and opinio juris reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state\u2019s relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.280 Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution\u2019s accuracy and veracity more objective\u2014a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 585)", "\u201cNonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.22 When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.23 The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.24 Other information, like the hackers\u2019 apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers\u2019 identity,25 but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation\u2014a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.26\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 528)", "\u201cBut setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.231 Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn\u2019t be required to comply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility\u2014and consistency232\u2014to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)", "\u201cTurning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release.197 Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea\u2019s actions.198 But some in the cybersecurity community publicly doubted the attribution,199 criticizing the U.S. government for providing limited and questionable evidence of North Korea\u2019s involvement.200 In response, the FBI released slightly more detailed evidence, citing operational errors by the hackers that revealed their use of internet protocol addresses used solely by North Korea.201\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 564)", "\u201cIn any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states\u2019 behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)", "\u201cFinally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.265 If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)", "\u201cThe fourth major coordinated attribution came in late February 2020 when Georgia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, among others, accused Russia of carrying out significant cyberattacks on October 28, 2019 against websites in Georgia, including sites belonging to the Georgian government, nongovernmental organizations, and media outlets.104 The accusing states did not provide evidence to support their accusations, which Russia denied.105 But the U.K. statement was notable for its specificity about the high level of certainty within the U.K. government, noting that \u201c[t]he UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre . . . assess[es] that the GRU was almost certainly (95%+) responsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia in October 2019.\u201d106\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 544)", "\u201cNow, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,7 scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules of international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.8 But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.9 A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non\u2013cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.10 Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts\u2014an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.11 This results in a double challenge for those deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing lex generalis from the noncyberspace context is hard to do, and lex specialis governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized.12 At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 525)", "\u201c\u201cAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale.

It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 577)", "\u201cCyberattack attributions aren\u2019t just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states\u2019 domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states\u2019 actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve\u2014from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace\u2014will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)", "\u201cCrosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant\u2019s APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.256 CrowdStrike\u2019s attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.257 Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.258 In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.259\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 60)", "\u201cThe requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may or may not choose to undertake, unlike the sliding scale approach from the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, which alters the evidence required based on the severity of the attack or anticipated response. The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state\u2019s only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 579)", "\u201cAdopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution. Consider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment\u2014a responsive action such as countermeasures.263 For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution and thus the accused state\u2019s wrongful act\u2014would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581)", "\u201cAlthough international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard \u00a0practice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet281 and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 586)", "\u201cPublicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states\u2019 actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing.

The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states\u2019 compliance.227 If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors\u2014both governmental and nongovernmental\u2014yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)", "\u201cAs a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.207 However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom. Customary international law requires both \u201cgeneral and consistent\u201d state practice and opinio juris\u2014that the state practice is undertaken out of a \u201csense of legal obligation.\u201d208 These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.209 Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere \u201cpolicy choice\u201d210 ensures that the states\u2019 recent practice of giving at least some evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.211 In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the opinio juris required for customary international law.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 565)", "\u201cThe proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of \u201ctrust, but verify,\u201d with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states\u2019 claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states\u2019 accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The lex specialis in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into lex generalis, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non\u2013cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining tankers and shooting down a U.S. drone.283 The potential for lex specialis to transform into lex generalis raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cImportantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)", "\u201cMoreover, a requirement for attributors to \u201cshow their work\u201d by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,253 including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decision making ex ante,254 and accountability for decisions ex post.255\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)", "\u201cIn addition to their practice in carrying out attributions to government actors, states have made some explicit statements regarding attribution-related evidentiary issues.

However, the reason states provide evidence\u2014whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement\u2014has significant consequences.213 Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.214 And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes a normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.215 States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another\u2019s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.216\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 567)", "\u201cOne might think that domestic law standards are sufficient to govern attributions. In particular, attributions are in many ways like indictments they are essentially accusations of wrongdoing\u2014so the probable cause standard might approximate the standard one would want international law to uphold.

Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have asserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.14 Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526)", "\u201cFirst, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.221 Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 569)", "\u201cThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.247 Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576)", "\u201cThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities\u2019 views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article\u2019s prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 529)", "\u201cState practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, \u201cinternational law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d195 The United Kingdom has said only that \u201cthe victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.\u201d196\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 563)", "\u201cFrom a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.218 This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.219 States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.220\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 568)", "\u201cTo understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution\u2014which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk\u2014to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course, establishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state\u2019s failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A\u2019s attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B\u2019s practice because State A\u2019s claim about State B\u2019s practice would not be credited.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 568)", "\u201cFor their part, and despite their practice of providing at least some evidence to accompany attributions, the United States and United Kingdom have advanced the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations. In a November 2016 speech, State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan explained: [D]espite the suggestion by some States to the contrary, there is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action. There may, of course, be political pressure to do so, and States may choose to reveal such evidence to convince other States to join them in condemnation, for example. But that is a policy choice\u2014it is not compelled by international law.112\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 545)", "\u201cAll of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.333 As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), plus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics\u2014geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.334 The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)", "\u201cOther attributions have included more details. Attributions-by-indictment in particular have been quite detailed, as have attributions-by-alert.202 The WannaCry attributions, initially done through official statements,203 were less detailed, but a subsequent indictment provided additional information.204 Among the most detailed attributions to date are those to the GRU in October 2018. There, the Dutch investigation produced significant evidence due to the physical presence of the Russian government operatives in the Netherlands,205 and the U.S. indictment provided considerable detail, particularly with respect to the targeting of worldwide antidoping organizations.206\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 564)", "\u201cThe second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.15 But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.16 In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law\u2014such as indictments and economic sanctions\u2014are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.17\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526)", "\u201cCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.264 Particularly with respect to attributions by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual\u2019s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581)", "\u201cAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors\u2014or different kinds of attributors\u2014may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments\u2019 attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences\u2014and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595)", "\u201cAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.288 Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, \u201cconsist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\u201d289 Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a \u201ctechnical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,\u201d which it would sometimes publish.290 Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a \u201cdiverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,\u201d including \u201c[a]t a minimum . . . representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.\u201d291 The white paper further suggests that attribution reports \u201ccan be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.\u201d292\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588)", "\u201cThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.314 First, if attributors adopt this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity\u2019s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,315 the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,316 but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed evidentiary standard fosters credibility because of decentralization and the promise of multiple attributors verifying attributions.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 593)", "\u201cSome of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which \u201cmay return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.\u201d233 A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged.234 The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause \u201cis not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.\u201d235\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 54)", "\u201cShortly after the attack, press reports indicated that North Korea was responsible,73 but official attributions came only months later. Britain started the ball rolling, with a government minister telling the BBC in October 2017 that North Korea was responsible, but declining to explain the evidentiary basis of the attribution.74 Then, in mid-December, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing WannaCry to North Korea and denouncing the country\u2019s actions.75 White House Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert explained in a press briefing that the United States \u201cdo[es] not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners,\u201d citing the support of allied countries and \u201c[c]ommercial partners,\u201d including Microsoft and Facebook, which \u201cact[ed] on their own initiative . . . without any direction by the U.S. government or coordination to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers.\u201d76 After the public attributions, additional actions took months. In June 2018, the United States criminally charged a North Korean citizen, alleged to be a member of \u201ca government-sponsored hacking team,\u201d for working for \u201ca North Korean government front company . . . to support the [North Korean] government\u2019s malicious cyber actions,\u201d including WannaCry.77 The Treasury Department also sanctioned him in September 2018.78 In 2019, the Treasury Department sanctioned additional North Korean entities for their involvement in WannaCry.79\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 539)", "\u201cThe ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention & Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide.180 The Court explained that \u201cclaims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.\u201d181 In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be \u201cfully convinced\u201d that genocide has occurred and that \u201c[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\u201d182 Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense in particular, its evidentiary standard appears more broadly applicable, adjusting based on the gravity of the offense claimed.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 561)", "\u201cIn addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions by indictment and attributions by sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.244 Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards would not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.245\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576)", "\u201cEven absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.170 In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole. The purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 558)", "\u201cDevelopment of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states\u2019 application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior\u2014rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.166 As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions \u201cserv[e] as an opening bid\u201d and can \u201clay out the contours of \u2018bad behavior\u2019 along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable\u201d\u2014an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.167 Public attributions foster \u201cinteractions between the accuser, the accused, and third party audiences that\u2014over time\u2014may result in the creation of a new norm.\u201d168 Translated into the language of customary international law: [P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a \u201cusage\u201d\u2014that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.169\nTo be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 558)", "\u201cThat leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.273 That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is \u201can express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.\u201d274 States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states\u2019 attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, \u201c[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,\u201d but rather \u201cit is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.\u201d275 Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.276 This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 584)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22586%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A66%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12129599999994%2C562.60761%2C475.2256139999992%2C572.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.80115199999995%2C549.1077%2C475.2300060000005%2C559.3959600000001%5D%2C%5B136.80115199999995%2C535.60779%2C475.24208399999986%2C545.8960500000001%5D%2C%5B136.80005400000002%2C522.10788%2C475.18718400000074%2C532.3961400000001%5D%2C%5B136.80005400000002%2C508.6079700000001%2C475.1575379999997%2C518.8962300000001%5D%2C%5B136.800054%2C495.1080600000001%2C475.20914400000055%2C505.39632000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80005400000002%2C481.60716%2C475.1404979999998%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799484%2C468.10725%2C475.12512600000053%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799484%2C454.60734%2C475.1855159999991%2C464.8956%5D%2C%5B136.799484%2C441.10743%2C475.1262240000007%2C451.39569%5D%2C%5B136.799484%2C427.60752%2C475.2019859999994%2C437.89578%5D%2C%5B136.799484%2C414.10761%2C475.1152439999992%2C424.39587%5D%2C%5B136.798386%2C400.6077%2C433.5515520000008%2C410.89596%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22586%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary lex specialis, tailored to the cybersecurity context.

The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22565%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A45%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12024600000004%2C417.107436%2C475.2245640000008%2C427.395696%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C403.607526%2C475.16087999999985%2C413.895786%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C390.107616%2C475.1037840000003%2C400.395876%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22565%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22571%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22580%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A60%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C630.10716%2C475.1924760000001%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C616.60725%2C475.185887999999%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C603.10734%2C475.15075199999984%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C589.60743%2C475.11122400000096%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C576.10716%2C475.18689600000005%2C587.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C562.60725%2C475.4844539999994%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C549.10734%2C475.1770139999995%2C559.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C535.60743%2C475.24508999999944%2C545.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C522.10752%2C475.1594459999996%2C532.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C508.6076100000001%2C475.21434600000094%2C518.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C495.1077000000001%2C475.1868960000007%2C505.39596000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C481.6077900000001%2C475.205561999999%2C491.89605000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C468.1078800000001%2C475.26924600000063%2C478.39614000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C454.6079700000001%2C475.21983599999976%2C464.89623000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C441.10716%2C475.227132%2C452.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80047399999995%2C427.60725%2C475.1557619999995%2C437.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80047399999995%2C414.10716%2C475.1452260000004%2C425.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79982%2C400.60725%2C475.2901620000002%2C410.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79872200000005%2C387.10734%2C244.66185000000007%2C397.3956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22580%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement\u2019s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard\u2019s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22580%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22585%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A65%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.11976000000004%2C562.60725%2C475.2295680000007%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79961600000004%2C549.10734%2C475.09671000000026%2C559.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.79961600000007%2C535.60743%2C475.1933339999993%2C545.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.7996160000001%2C522.10752%2C475.19662800000094%2C532.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.79961600000013%2C508.6076100000001%2C475.19772600000033%2C518.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.79961600000013%2C495.1077000000001%2C475.1906400000001%2C506.35992%5D%2C%5B136.799694%2C481.60725%2C475.05616200000026%2C491.89551%5D%2C%5B136.799694%2C468.10734%2C475.1791380000007%2C478.3956%5D%2C%5B136.799694%2C454.60743%2C475.23293999999913%2C464.89569%5D%2C%5B136.799694%2C441.10752%2C475.161569999999%2C451.39578%5D%2C%5B136.799694%2C427.60761%2C352.7521379999998%2C437.89587%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22585%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTaken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and opinio juris reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions.

On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.10 Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts\u2014an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.11 This results in a double challenge for</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22525%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.1651699999994%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C475.05866399999996%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C603.10734%2C475.50225600000033%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.798902%2C589.60716%2C475.49380199999985%2C600.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80033%2C576.10725%2C475.3851000000004%2C586.3955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80033%2C562.60734%2C475.36753200000044%2C572.8956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80033%2C549.10743%2C475.3949820000004%2C559.3956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80033%2C535.60752%2C413.8334159999995%2C545.8957800000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22525%22%7D%7D\">those deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing lex generalis from the noncyberspace context is hard to do, and lex specialis governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized.12 At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity.

The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant\u2019s APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.256 CrowdStrike\u2019s attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.257 Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.258 In some circumstances, this is a question of form.

Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors\u2014both governmental and nongovernmental\u2014yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22527%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22564%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A44%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.119448%2C441.10725%2C475.0909080000006%2C451.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799304%2C427.60734%2C475.1545919999992%2C437.8956%5D%2C%5B136.79930399999998%2C414.10743%2C392.7506400000001%2C425.35992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22564%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.207</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22565%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A45%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C630.10716%2C475.2429840000006%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C616.60725%2C475.12439999999935%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C603.10734%2C475.12110599999926%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C589.60743%2C475.09145999999885%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C576.10752%2C475.2045540000003%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.800954%2C562.60716%2C475.50313199999965%2C573.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799778%2C549.10725%2C475.1188319999993%2C559.3955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799778%2C535.60716%2C475.1596319999998%2C546.85992%5D%2C%5B136.79995199999996%2C522.10716%2C475.2381420000001%2C533.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800504%2C508.6072500000001%2C475.2063000000001%2C518.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79940599999998%2C495.10716%2C475.14221399999957%2C506.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C481.60725%2C475.2783659999996%2C491.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C468.10734%2C441.5884319999993%2C478.3956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22565%22%7D%7D\">However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom.

The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.14 Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context.

The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.221 Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22569%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 569</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22576%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A56%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C430.607%2C475.112%2C440.896%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C417.107%2C475.283%2C427.396%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C403.607%2C475.18%2C413.896%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C390.107%2C475.147%2C401.36%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C376.607%2C475.18%2C386.896%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C363.107%2C475.139%2C373.396%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C349.607%2C400.955%2C359.896%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22576%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.247 Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22576%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22529%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.11946%2C454.6078800000001%2C475.2479340000005%2C464.89614000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C441.1079700000001%2C475.23805200000044%2C451.39623000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C427.6080600000001%2C475.1611920000001%2C437.89632000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C414.1081500000001%2C475.21060200000073%2C424.39641000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C400.6082400000001%2C475.17766199999954%2C410.89650000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C387.1083300000001%2C475.20730799999956%2C397.39659000000006%5D%2C%5B136.799316%2C373.6084200000001%2C475.2369539999999%2C383.89668000000006%5D%2C%5B136.799316%2C360.1085100000001%2C475.1008019999996%2C370.39677000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C346.6086000000001%2C475.17326999999926%2C356.89686000000006%5D%2C%5B136.799316%2C333.1086900000001%2C475.19522999999907%2C343.39695000000006%5D%2C%5B136.799316%2C319.6087800000001%2C475.10299800000064%2C329.89704000000006%5D%2C%5B136.799316%2C306.1088700000001%2C475.1304480000001%2C316.39713000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79931600000003%2C292.6089600000001%2C280.6076699999998%2C302.89722000000006%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22529%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute.

State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution\u2014which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk\u2014to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established.

But a state\u2019s failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice.

If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.15 But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.16 In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law\u2014such as indictments and economic sanctions\u2014are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.17\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22526%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22581%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A61%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12014400000004%2C603.10734%2C475.1541900000007%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000004%2C589.60743%2C475.06085999999954%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000007%2C576.10752%2C475.16077800000096%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000007%2C562.60761%2C475.164071999999%2C572.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000007%2C549.1077%2C475.21128599999884%2C559.3959600000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000007%2C535.60779%2C475.19371800000056%2C545.8960500000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000007%2C522.10716%2C475.0870499999993%2C533.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000002%2C508.6072500000001%2C475.1781840000005%2C518.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000002%2C495.1073400000001%2C475.1683020000005%2C505.39560000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C481.6074300000001%2C475.12218599999915%2C491.89569000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C468.1075200000001%2C475.18367399999914%2C478.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C454.6076100000001%2C475.06179599999996%2C464.89587000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C441.1077000000001%2C475.1737920000009%2C451.39596000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C427.6077900000001%2C475.0530119999993%2C437.89605000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C414.1078800000001%2C475.1913599999996%2C424.39614000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79983800000005%2C400.6079700000001%2C342.50354999999985%2C410.89623000000006%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22581%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCreating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.264 Particularly with respect to attributions by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual\u2019s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22581%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22595%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A75%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120534%2C468.10743%2C475.178736%2C478.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C454.60752%2C475.50154800000024%2C464.89578%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C441.10761%2C475.12493400000005%2C451.39587%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C427.6077%2C475.1831279999999%2C437.89596%5D%2C%5B136.80038999999996%2C414.10779%2C475.1051699999999%2C424.39605%5D%2C%5B136.80038999999996%2C400.60788%2C475.1721479999999%2C410.89614%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C387.10797%2C475.1545799999987%2C397.39623%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C373.60806%2C475.1370119999997%2C383.89632%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C360.10815%2C475.19850000000076%2C370.39641%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C346.60824%2C475.17324600000006%2C356.8965%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C333.10833%2C475.1930100000001%2C343.39659%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C319.60842%2C475.14579599999917%2C329.89668%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C306.10851%2C475.19850000000065%2C316.39677%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C292.6086%2C475.1106599999995%2C302.89686%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C279.10869%2C475.22704800000025%2C289.39695%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C265.60878%2C475.3741800000002%2C275.89704%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000008%2C252.10887%2C373.8750599999994%2C262.39713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22595%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors\u2014or different kinds of attributors\u2014may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments\u2019 attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences\u2014and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22595%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.11983799999996%2C535.60725%2C475.0989839999993%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79969399999996%2C522.10734%2C475.208784%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.79969399999996%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.13521799999927%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.79969399999996%2C495.10716%2C475.16080800000066%2C506.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80003000000002%2C481.60725%2C475.12457399999977%2C491.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80003000000002%2C468.10734%2C475.13116200000053%2C478.3956%5D%2C%5B136.80003%2C454.60716%2C475.1098320000002%2C465.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799562%2C441.10725%2C475.25586600000094%2C451.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799562%2C427.60716%2C475.1790240000004%2C438.85992%5D%2C%5B136.79958%2C414.10725%2C475.0966739999988%2C424.39551%5D%2C%5B136.79958%2C400.60734%2C475.159259999999%2C410.8956%5D%2C%5B136.79958%2C387.10743%2C475.1460839999995%2C397.39569%5D%2C%5B136.79958%2C373.60716%2C475.09665600000045%2C384.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799562%2C360.10725%2C408.7706400000001%2C371.35992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.288 Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, \u201cconsist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\u201d289 Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a \u201ctechnical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,\u201d which it would sometimes publish.290 Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a \u201cdiverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,\u201d including \u201c[a]t a minimum . . . representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.\u201d291 The white paper further suggests that attribution reports \u201ccan be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.\u201d292\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22592%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A72%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12013199999996%2C468.10725%2C475.15527600000013%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80108599999997%2C454.60734%2C451.6106400000001%2C465.85992%5D%2C%5B159.12048600000003%2C441.10725%2C475.1984520000007%2C451.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034200000003%2C427.60734%2C475.26872400000053%2C437.8956%5D%2C%5B136.80034200000003%2C414.10743%2C475.1018279999994%2C424.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80034200000003%2C400.60716%2C475.06716600000027%2C411.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799718%2C387.10725%2C475.2340619999988%2C397.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799718%2C373.60716%2C475.27414800000025%2C384.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800276%2C360.10725%2C475.14787799999897%2C370.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800276%2C346.60734%2C475.2115620000001%2C356.8956%5D%2C%5B136.80027599999997%2C333.10743%2C475.2401099999994%2C343.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22592%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.314 First, if attributors adopt this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity\u2019s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,315 the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,316 but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated.

The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions by indictment and attributions by sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.244 Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace.

One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is \u201can express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.\u201d274 States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves.

Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as lex specialis on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky lex generalis of international law on evidence.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)", "\u201cSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of \u201ccyber CSI effect.\u201d224 Pursuant to the so-called \u201cCSI effect,\u201d the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties\u2019 practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states\u2019 expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cThe Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors\u2014both governmental and nongovernmental\u2014yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)", "\u201cAs a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.207 However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom.

But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them.

Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors\u2014both governmental and nongovernmental\u2014yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22527%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22564%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A44%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.119448%2C441.10725%2C475.0909080000006%2C451.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799304%2C427.60734%2C475.1545919999992%2C437.8956%5D%2C%5B136.79930399999998%2C414.10743%2C392.7506400000001%2C425.35992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22564%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.207</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22565%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A45%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C630.10716%2C475.2429840000006%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C616.60725%2C475.12439999999935%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C603.10734%2C475.12110599999926%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C589.60743%2C475.09145999999885%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C576.10752%2C475.2045540000003%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.800954%2C562.60716%2C475.50313199999965%2C573.85992%5D%2C%5B136.799778%2C549.10725%2C475.1188319999993%2C559.3955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799778%2C535.60716%2C475.1596319999998%2C546.85992%5D%2C%5B136.79995199999996%2C522.10716%2C475.2381420000001%2C533.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800504%2C508.6072500000001%2C475.2063000000001%2C518.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79940599999998%2C495.10716%2C475.14221399999957%2C506.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C481.60725%2C475.2783659999996%2C491.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C468.10734%2C441.5884319999993%2C478.3956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22565%22%7D%7D\">However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571)", "\u201cWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures\u2014does not address evidentiary issues.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22571%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22562%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A42%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120006%2C414.10725%2C475.3132620000008%2C424.39551%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C400.60734%2C475.1353859999996%2C410.8956%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C387.10743%2C475.15405200000066%2C397.39569%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C373.60752%2C475.17052200000046%2C383.89578%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C360.10761%2C475.21773600000023%2C370.39587%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C346.6077%2C475.2078540000001%2C356.89596%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C333.10779%2C475.12330799999967%2C343.39605%5D%2C%5B136.799862%2C319.60716%2C475.1898180000007%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80049200000002%2C306.10725%2C475.2227580000005%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80049200000002%2C292.60716%2C475.12705800000055%2C303.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22562%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear.

In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.264 Particularly with respect to attributions by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual\u2019s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.

the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.288 Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, \u201cconsist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.\u201d289 Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a \u201ctechnical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,\u201d which it would sometimes publish.290 Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a \u201cdiverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,\u201d including \u201c[a]t a minimum . . . representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.\u201d291 The white paper further suggests that attribution

micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.264 Particularly with respect to attributions by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual\u2019s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22581%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.

Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cThe decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.314 First, if attributors adopt this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity\u2019s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,315 the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,316 but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed evidentiary standard fosters credibility because of decentralization and the promise of multiple attributors verifying attributions.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 593)", "\u201cFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)", "\u201cDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement\u2019s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard\u2019s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580)", "\u201cSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses\u2014cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)", "\u201cSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of \u201ccyber CSI effect.\u201d224 Pursuant to the so-called \u201cCSI effect,\u201d the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties\u2019 practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states\u2019 expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cMoreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 577)", "\u201cRelegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such \u201ctrust us\u201d attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because \u201ctrust us\u201d will only work with allies.217 And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 567)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22570%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A50%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12037799999996%2C481.6077000000001%2C475.23348000000027%2C491.89596000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999993%2C468.1077900000001%2C475.21261799999934%2C478.39605000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999993%2C454.6078800000001%2C475.2455580000007%2C464.89614000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999993%2C441.1079700000001%2C475.2148139999996%2C451.39623000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999996%2C427.60716%2C475.46306400000014%2C438.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C414.10725%2C475.4806319999993%2C424.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C400.60734%2C475.41694799999976%2C410.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C387.10743%2C475.3258139999995%2C397.39569%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C373.60752%2C475.21271999999993%2C383.89578%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C360.10761%2C475.2829919999998%2C370.39587%5D%2C%5B136.800336%2C346.6077%2C406.99288200000007%2C356.89596%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22570%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThird, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification.

Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement\u2019s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard\u2019s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22580%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22587%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A67%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12031799999997%2C525.107208%2C475.18950000000103%2C535.395468%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C511.60729800000007%2C475.09617000000026%2C521.895558%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C498.10738800000007%2C475.1411880000008%2C508.39564800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C484.60747800000007%2C475.17742199999975%2C494.89573800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C471.1075680000001%2C475.1345999999994%2C481.39582800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C457.6076580000001%2C475.1543639999988%2C467.89591800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C444.1077480000001%2C475.2356160000008%2C454.39600800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C430.6078380000001%2C475.2795359999999%2C440.89609800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C417.1079280000001%2C475.2850259999992%2C427.39618800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C403.6080180000001%2C475.21585199999976%2C413.89627800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C390.1081080000001%2C475.2795360000001%2C400.39636800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C376.6081980000001%2C475.3047899999994%2C386.89645800000005%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C363.1082880000001%2C475.27185000000037%2C373.39654800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C349.6083780000001%2C475.2828299999989%2C359.89663800000005%5D%2C%5B136.8001739999999%2C336.1084680000001%2C453.6039180000002%2C346.39672800000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSetting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article\u2019s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22587%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22582%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A62%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120144%2C603.10734%2C475.1849339999992%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C589.60743%2C475.12125000000003%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C576.10752%2C475.26398999999924%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C562.60761%2C475.15419000000026%2C572.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C549.1077%2C475.33755599999984%2C559.3959600000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C535.60779%2C475.52860799999956%2C545.8960500000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C522.10788%2C466.1165519999998%2C532.3961400000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22582%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses\u2014cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force.

The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of \u201ccyber CSI effect.\u201d224 Pursuant to the so-called \u201cCSI effect,\u201d the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22570%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A50%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.08945000000034%2C641.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80004200000002%2C616.60725%2C475.13117399999936%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80004200000002%2C603.10734%2C475.22999400000015%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80004200000002%2C589.60743%2C475.2783059999999%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80004200000002%2C576.10752%2C475.2530519999993%2C586.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.80004200000002%2C562.60716%2C475.1895599999999%2C573.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800234%2C549.10725%2C475.18956000000026%2C559.3955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800234%2C535.60734%2C475.0764659999999%2C545.8956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999996%2C522.10743%2C475.1478360000007%2C532.3956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999996%2C508.6075200000001%2C475.1851679999997%2C518.8957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.80023399999996%2C495.1076100000001%2C424.2950639999996%2C505.39587000000006%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22570%22%7D%7D\">prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties\u2019 practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states\u2019 expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed.

Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement\u2019s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard\u2019s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580)", "\u201cFinally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)", "\u201cFinally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic effects, supporting stability and helping to avoid conflict over cyberspace. Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571)", "\u201c\u201cAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states\u2019 use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.251\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 577)", "\u201cThe legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses\u2014cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)", "\u201cMoreover, a requirement for attributors to \u201cshow their work\u201d by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,253 including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decision making ex ante,254 and accountability for decisions ex post.255\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)", "\u201cSecond, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of \u201ccyber CSI effect.\u201d224 Pursuant to the so-called \u201cCSI effect,\u201d the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties\u2019 practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states\u2019 expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)", "\u201cThe paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary lex specialis, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.282 Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard\u2014including providing clarity about what\u2019s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior\u2014could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially mandating evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 586)", "\u201cAt least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 566)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22580%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A60%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C630.10716%2C475.1924760000001%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C616.60725%2C475.185887999999%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C603.10734%2C475.15075199999984%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C589.60743%2C475.11122400000096%2C599.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.799856%2C576.10716%2C475.18689600000005%2C587.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C562.60725%2C475.4844539999994%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C549.10734%2C475.1770139999995%2C559.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C535.60743%2C475.24508999999944%2C545.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C522.10752%2C475.1594459999996%2C532.3957800000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C508.6076100000001%2C475.21434600000094%2C518.8958700000001%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C495.1077000000001%2C475.1868960000007%2C505.39596000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C481.6077900000001%2C475.205561999999%2C491.89605000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C468.1078800000001%2C475.26924600000063%2C478.39614000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C454.6079700000001%2C475.21983599999976%2C464.89623000000006%5D%2C%5B136.79976599999998%2C441.10716%2C475.227132%2C452.35992%5D%2C%5B136.80047399999995%2C427.60725%2C475.1557619999995%2C437.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80047399999995%2C414.10716%2C475.1452260000004%2C425.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79982%2C400.60725%2C475.2901620000002%2C410.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79872200000005%2C387.10734%2C244.66185000000007%2C397.3956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22580%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDefining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor.

States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22571%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2258%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A57%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12%2C427.607%2C475.252%2C437.896%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C414.107%2C475.216%2C424.396%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C400.607%2C475.177%2C410.896%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C387.108%2C475.098%2C397.396%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C373.608%2C475.133%2C383.896%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C360.108%2C475.013%2C370.396%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C346.608%2C463.851%2C357.86%5D%2C%5B159.12%2C333.107%2C475.225%2C343.396%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C319.607%2C475.122%2C329.896%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C306.107%2C475.244%2C316.396%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C292.608%2C475.199%2C302.896%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C279.108%2C475.154%2C289.396%5D%2C%5B136.799%2C265.608%2C366.664%2C275.896%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2258%22%7D%7D\">\u201c</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22577%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A57%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120234%2C427.60725%2C475.2520020000009%2C437.89551%5D%2C%5B136.80009%2C414.10734%2C475.215768%2C424.3956%5D%2C%5B136.80009%2C400.60743%2C475.1773379999996%2C410.89569%5D%2C%5B136.80009%2C387.10752%2C475.09828200000004%2C397.39578%5D%2C%5B136.80009000000004%2C373.60761%2C475.1334180000005%2C383.89587%5D%2C%5B136.80009000000004%2C360.1077%2C475.0126380000004%2C370.39596%5D%2C%5B136.80009000000004%2C346.60779%2C463.8506400000001%2C357.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22577%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAdopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have asserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play.

And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22526%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22552%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A32%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12050399999998%2C468.10725%2C475.18200000000104%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C454.60734%2C475.491636%2C464.8956%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C441.10743%2C475.1666279999991%2C451.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C427.60752%2C475.1929799999991%2C437.89578%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C414.10716%2C475.188036%2C425.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C400.60725%2C475.1276460000003%2C410.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C387.10734%2C475.2154860000007%2C397.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C373.60716%2C475.1634%2C384.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80042600000002%2C360.10725%2C442.4397059999995%2C370.39551%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22552%22%7D%7D\">\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior.

Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.1 Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.2 Another is insurance coverage.3 Invoking coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.4 Still other important examples involve cyberbased responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline5 to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)", "\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)", "\u201cFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.2 Another is insurance coverage.3 Invoking</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22523%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.18603199999916%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000004%2C616.60725%2C475.20908999999926%2C626.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000004%2C603.10734%2C475.16407200000026%2C613.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80000000000004%2C589.60716%2C475.4320439999988%2C600.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80006000000003%2C576.10725%2C475.4100839999997%2C586.3955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80006000000003%2C562.60716%2C475.4049420000003%2C573.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22523%22%7D%7D\">coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.4 Still other important examples involve cyberbased responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline5 to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22523%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22552%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A32%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12050399999998%2C468.10725%2C475.18200000000104%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C454.60734%2C475.491636%2C464.8956%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C441.10743%2C475.1666279999991%2C451.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C427.60752%2C475.1929799999991%2C437.89578%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C414.10716%2C475.188036%2C425.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C400.60725%2C475.1276460000003%2C410.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C387.10734%2C475.2154860000007%2C397.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C373.60716%2C475.1634%2C384.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80042600000002%2C360.10725%2C442.4397059999995%2C370.39551%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22552%22%7D%7D\">\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior.

Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22590%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cCyberattack attributions aren\u2019t just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states\u2019 domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states\u2019 actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve\u2014from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace\u2014will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)", "\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)", "\u201cFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cCyberattack attributions aren\u2019t just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states\u2019 domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states\u2019 actions in cyberspace.

Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states\u2019 domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states\u2019 actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve\u2014from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace\u2014will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22597%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22552%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A32%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12050399999998%2C468.10725%2C475.18200000000104%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C454.60734%2C475.491636%2C464.8956%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C441.10743%2C475.1666279999991%2C451.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C427.60752%2C475.1929799999991%2C437.89578%5D%2C%5B136.80035999999998%2C414.10716%2C475.188036%2C425.35992%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C400.60725%2C475.1276460000003%2C410.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C387.10734%2C475.2154860000007%2C397.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79980799999998%2C373.60716%2C475.1634%2C384.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80042600000002%2C360.10725%2C442.4397059999995%2C370.39551%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22552%22%7D%7D\">\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior.

To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors\u2014companies, governments, and academic experts\u2014to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution\u2019s credibility.252 Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace and may foster

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cTake the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors\u2014companies, governments, and academic experts\u2014to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution\u2019s credibility.252 Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)", "\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)", "\u201cFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22590%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cThe fourth major coordinated attribution came in late February 2020 when Georgia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, among others, accused Russia of carrying out significant cyberattacks on October 28, 2019 against websites in Georgia, including sites belonging to the Georgian government, nongovernmental organizations, and media outlets.104 The accusing states did not provide evidence to support their accusations, which Russia denied.105 But the U.K. statement was notable for its specificity about the high level of certainty within the U.K. government, noting that \u201c[t]he UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre . . . assess[es] that the GRU was almost certainly (95%+) responsible for defacing websites, cyber-attacks and interruption to TV channels in Georgia in October 2019.\u201d106\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 544)", "\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)", "\u201cCyberattack attributions aren\u2019t just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states\u2019 domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states\u2019 actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve\u2014from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace\u2014will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cFiguring out who\u2019s doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.1 Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.2 Another is insurance coverage.3 Invoking coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.4 Still other important examples involve cyberbased responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline5 to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)", "\u201cThe problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals\u2019 authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of \u201cmultilateral\u201d in the title suggests, of states.284\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)", "\u201cVictim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)", "\u201cFinally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22546%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12008400000002%2C562.60725%2C475.178286%2C572.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.80103800000003%2C549.10716%2C475.11922799999934%2C560.35992%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C535.60725%2C475.2246359999996%2C545.8955100000001%5D%2C%5B136.800174%2C522.10734%2C475.13130600000005%2C532.3956000000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C508.6074300000001%2C475.1587559999993%2C518.8956900000001%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999997%2C495.1075200000001%2C475.2004800000001%2C505.39578000000006%5D%2C%5B136.80017399999994%2C481.60716%2C475.14904799999914%2C492.85992%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C468.10725%2C475.28190600000005%2C478.39551%5D%2C%5B136.80034799999999%2C454.60734%2C475.30606199999966%2C464.8956%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22546%22%7D%7D\">\u201cScholars have noted the disagreement among states over the evidentiary issue.116 In the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, a comprehensive attempt to restate existing international law as it applies to cyberspace, an international group of experts under the auspices of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence acknowledged states\u2019 divergent positions on the existence of a legal requirement.117 The experts concluded that \u201calthough [providing evidence] . . . may be prudent in avoiding political and other tensions, insufficient State practice and opinio juris (in great part because cyber</span> \u00a0<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22547%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B136.8%2C630.10716%2C475.17834600000003%2C640.3954200000001%5D%2C%5B136.8%2C616.60725%2C372.2906400000001%2C627.85992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%7D\">capabilities are highly classified) exist to conclude that there is an established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d118\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22547%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

Cyberattack victims often \u201ceither cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.\u201d305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article\u2019s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22590%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571)", "\u201cFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have asserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly.

Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace\u2014an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22571%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22525%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.11959199999998%2C373.60806%2C475.51707599999975%2C383.89632%5D%2C%5B136.79944799999998%2C360.10815%2C475.47644999999955%2C370.39641%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22525%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst is the interrelationship between law and politics.

Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors\u2014companies, governments, and academic experts\u2014to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution\u2019s credibility.252 Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states\u2019 behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22559%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A39%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.11974199999997%2C378.10734%2C475.214178%2C388.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79959800000003%2C364.60743%2C475.20100200000104%2C374.89569%5D%2C%5B136.79959800000003%2C351.10752%2C475.2504119999995%2C361.39578%5D%2C%5B136.79959800000003%2C337.60761%2C475.1691600000001%2C347.89587%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22559%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSome support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that it has suffered an armed attack.

Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d and emphasizes that the Consortium must have \u201cbroad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.\u201d294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium\u2019s membership should be drawn from: \u201c(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.\u201d296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the \u201csignificant expertise\u201d outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to \u201cshape the Consortium\u2019s findings to serve their national interests,\u201d and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that \u201cmight shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.\u201d297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)", "\u201cThe third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about \u201ca malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea\u2019s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.\u201d54 The alert \u201cprovides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.\u201d55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 535)", "\u201cAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one\u2014a victim state need not announce that it has been attacked or identify the perpetrator.212 But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 566)", "\u201c\u201cAttribution\u201d has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, \u201cattribution\u201d refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.19\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)", "\u201cAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors\u2014or different kinds of attributors\u2014may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments\u2019 attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences\u2014and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\u201d (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22588%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A68%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12005399999995%2C346.60725%2C475.2155879999997%2C356.89551%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C333.10734%2C475.19911800000074%2C343.3956%5D%2C%5B136.79990999999993%2C319.60716%2C475.11298800000003%2C330.85992%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C306.10725%2C475.19972999999897%2C316.39551%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C292.60734%2C475.13384999999965%2C302.8956%5D%2C%5B136.800522%2C279.10743%2C475.18874999999997%2C289.39569%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22588%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments.

For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about \u201ca malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea\u2019s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.\u201d54 The alert \u201cprovides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.\u201d55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22535%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 535</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22565%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A45%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.12024600000004%2C417.107436%2C475.2245640000008%2C427.395696%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C403.607526%2C475.16087999999985%2C413.895786%5D%2C%5B136.80010200000004%2C390.107616%2C475.1037840000003%2C400.395876%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22565%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy.

At the most general level, \u201cattribution\u201d refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.19\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22527%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF9ZPYV3M%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22595%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A75%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B159.120534%2C468.10743%2C475.178736%2C478.39569%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C454.60752%2C475.50154800000024%2C464.89578%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C441.10761%2C475.12493400000005%2C451.39587%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C427.6077%2C475.1831279999999%2C437.89596%5D%2C%5B136.80038999999996%2C414.10779%2C475.1051699999999%2C424.39605%5D%2C%5B136.80038999999996%2C400.60788%2C475.1721479999999%2C410.89614%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C387.10797%2C475.1545799999987%2C397.39623%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C373.60806%2C475.1370119999997%2C383.89632%5D%2C%5B136.80039%2C360.10815%2C475.19850000000076%2C370.39641%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C346.60824%2C475.17324600000006%2C356.8965%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C333.10833%2C475.1930100000001%2C343.39659%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C319.60842%2C475.14579599999917%2C329.89668%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C306.10851%2C475.19850000000065%2C316.39677%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000002%2C292.6086%2C475.1106599999995%2C302.89686%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C279.10869%2C475.22704800000025%2C289.39695%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000005%2C265.60878%2C475.3741800000002%2C275.89704%5D%2C%5B136.80039000000008%2C252.10887%2C373.8750599999994%2C262.39713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22595%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAnother way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors\u2014or different kinds of attributors\u2014may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments\u2019 attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences\u2014and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FC4B75HRU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22595%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "KE Eichensehr", "date": "2020", "journal": "UCLA L.
