Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany have highlighted two key differences between cyber and other kinds of attacks: the boundlessness and anonymity of the cyber domain.11 As cyberspace is not limited by physical or geographical borders, questions of jurisdiction and enforcement become more complex. Perpetrators use various techniques to obscure their true location, and isolating the origin of a cyberattack is extraordinarily difficult when attacks are routed through multiple machines in multiple locations across the world. These techniques make the task of retrospectively establishing a forensic link between an attacker and an incident extremely difficult. They allow cyberattacks to be carried out with little risk to those involved, with perpetrators able to mask their identity and potentially even misattribute blame.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cIn theory, there is no obstacle to a cyberattack reaching the threshold of both a \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack.\u201d A cyberattack will constitute a use of force \u201cwhen its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.\u201d6 In order to objectively assess whether a cyberattack rises to this level, states likely will consider the severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality of the operation.7\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cThere is ostensibly general agreement that the commonly accepted rules of public international law surrounding the use of force also apply to cyberattacks. The starting point here is the prohibition on the use of cross-border force,2 absent authorization by the Security Council3 or circumstances of self-defense.4 However, while the right to self-defense potentially applies to cyberattacks, it is available only in response to an \u201carmed attack.\u201d5 Therefore, whether a cyberattack can be classified as a \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack\u201d is critical in understanding the lawful responses that are available to a state.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 202)", "\u201cA precise definition of what constitutes an \u201carmed attack\u201d is more elusive. It is well-established that \u201cit will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms\u201d with \u201carmed attacks\u201d being different in their \u201cscale and effects\u201d from lesser uses of force.8 However, the exact threshold is not clear. The Tallinn Manual suggests that \u201cacts of cyber intelligence gathering and cyber theft, as well as cyber operations that involve brief or periodic interruption of non-essential cyber services\u201d will not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack.\u201d9 To date, few if any of the known cyberattacks appear to meet the threshold for a \u201cuse of force,\u201d let alone for an \u201carmed attack.\u201d10\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cThe principles of attribution relating to the actions of nonstate actors are particularly relevant to cyberattacks, given that \u201cthe relative availability and cheapness of the technology necessary to mount a cyber-attack makes significant attacks launched by private individuals or corporations far more feasible compared with other types of warfare.\u201d19 Attribution here is also critical given the prevailing view that cyberattacks conducted by nonstate actors that are not attributable to states are not a use of force for the purposes of the UN Charter regime.20\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204)", "\u201cIn late 2018, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security suggested that \u201ccyber-attacks now exceed the risk of physical attacks.\u201d1 Yet the law has not kept pace with this reality. In particular, identifying who is responsible for a cyberattack makes it difficult to regulate this conduct. A state often cannot practically respond to a threat unless it knows from where the threat emanates and potentially who is responsible. Attribution of cyber conduct is critical from a legal perspective because the unlawful act must be attributable to another state for state responsibility to be engaged.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 202)", "\u201cThus, cyberattacks often take more time to detect and evaluate than traditional kinetic attacks. This analysis might require using classified intelligence and technological capabilities that a state would prefer not to reveal. All of these factors make it challenging to attribute cyberattacks.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cUltimately, when dealing with cyber armed attacks, attribution, and self-defense, the bar is set so high that it will rarely be met practice. The key questions are: has there been an armed attack; have the requirements of selfdefense been established; and can responsibility be attributed to a state? For each question there are significant difficulties with applying conventional principles to cyber armed attacks.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cThe conventional principles of self-defense and attribution are poorly suited to dealing with cyber armed attacks. The technical problems of attribution in cyberspace may make it practically impossible for victim states to meet the legal requirements of both attribution and self-defense. Under the current legal framework, states are effectively prevented from utilizing the right to self-defense in response to a cyber armed attack.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cThis essay provides an overview of this attribution problem in the context of cyberattacks that might qualify as armed attacks for purposes of the jus ad bellum. These attacks are especially grave and, as such, ones that states will most want to respond to decisively. Understanding the availability and limits of a lawful response is therefore critical. The essay begins by briefly reviewing the current state of international law concerning armed attacks and selfdefense, and whether and how cyberattacks fit within this framework. It then examines the attribution problem, noting that there are both technical and legal hurdles to overcome when attempting to reconcile conventional approaches to attribution with the unconventional characteristics of a cyberattack. Finally, it proposes a more contextually appropriate model for attribution that states could use in the case of cyber armed attacks to address the attribution problem.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 202)", "\u201cThese technical difficulties have two main consequences for attribution, both of which are critical in relation to cyber armed attacks. The first is that the risk of misattribution is heightened, leading to the potential for seriousconflict escalation if a state mistakenly targets an innocent third party in its self-defense response. The second is that the length of time it will realistically take to correctly identify the perpetrator will very likely mean that it will be significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of self-defense.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204)", "\u201cOne option would be a strict liability model that holds host states indirectly responsible for breaches occurring within their territory. Vincent-Jo\u00ebl Proulx proposed such a model in the context of terrorism.28 Allowing it to authorize acts of self-defense in relation to cyberattacks is, in our view, dangerously flawed due to the risk of misattribution. However, a strict liability approach holds appeal when states are instead pursuing negotiated outcomes through legal means, as the adverse effects of misattribution are significantly reduced. Under this approach an injured state may, for example, be able to use countermeasures against the state from which the cyberattack allegedly originated (assuming the other legal requirements for countermeasures are met),29 even if there was no evidence that the host state had any involvement in the attack beyond its territory being used. A strict liability model also encourages state cooperation by creating potential liability for reparations. When we consider that some estimates have put the potential costs from the previously mentioned WannaCry attack at US$4 billion,30 the strong incentive that this model establishes for states to actively cooperate to prevent cyberattacks is readily apparent.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cTurning to the legal problems of attribution, a state will not be held responsible for an internationally wrongful act unless that act is attributable to the state under international law,16 with the conventional principles of state responsibility applying to cyberattacks.17 The conduct of a nonstate actor may be attributed to a state where the nonstate actor is \u201cacting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of \u201d the state, or where the state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own.18\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204)", "\u201cOne possible response to these challenges is to lower the attribution threshold in cases of cyberattacks.25 If the existing legal framework creates a threshold so high that states have no prospect of attributing responsibility for a cyber armed attack, states will be effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defense. This creates a dangerous practical lacuna, and emboldens perpetrators by allowing them to operate with impunity. It is unrealistic to assume that a state in these circumstances would simply not respond to a cyber armed attack. Instead, states will likely respond outside of the existing legal framework. An excessively high attribution threshold ultimately leaves states with no lawful option for self-defense and undermines the rules-based international order by incentivizing covert retaliatory cyber operations.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cIn any event, regardless of whether \u201ceffective control\u201d or \u201coverall control\u201d ultimately applies, the attribution threshold remains extremely high. Mere encouragement or support by a state through financing and equipping groups will be insufficient for attribution.24 Simply financing a cyberattack or providing a safe haven to nonstate perpetrators would not appear to meet the threshold for the state itself to be held responsible for a cyberattack.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cTraditionally there has been a high threshold for attributing the actions of nonstate actors to states, requiring the state to have had \u201ceffective control\u201d over each specific operation for which attribution is sought.21 The InternationalCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia adopted a broader standard of \u201coverall control\u201d in Prosecutor v. Tadi\u0107.22 Although lowering the threshold, Tadi\u0107\u2019s \u201coverall control\u201d standard applied to an organized and hierarchically structured group. This quasi-military context is easily distinguishable from the more decentralized groupings usually associated with cyberattacks. Further, the ICJ has rejected the use of the \u201coverall control\u201d test.23\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cOf course, self-defense is not the only legal option available to states.31 In particular, in many scenarios, countermeasures may be a useful form of nonforcible self-help. Similarly, there are relevant legal obligations other than the prohibition on the use of force, with the general due diligence obligation being especially relevant. A comprehensive examination of these is beyond the scope of this essay, but all have relevance in the context of the legal framework surrounding cyberattacks.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cIn the specific context of cyber armed attacks, however, conventional principles could be adapted by developing a model that varies attribution requirements based upon the victim state\u2019s contemplated response. Such a model would build on existing legal foundations, minimize the risk of misattribution and conflict escalation, and incentivize cooperation between states. It would also go some way towards addressing some of the existing challenges with regards to attribution that this essay has identified.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cIt is critical to establish an attribution standard that strikes the right balance. As we have previously observed, there is the risk of escalating tension and conflict from misdirected retaliation due to flawed attribution or, alternatively, precluding law-abiding states from lawfully responding to cyberattacks because the legal prerequisite of attribution is practically impossible to establish.27 Therefore, approaching cases of cyber armed attack using the conventional principles of attribution is unlikely to be helpful, given that the threshold questions cannot realistically be answered. Instead, a more nuanced model that applies variable attribution standards based upon the remedy the victim state chooses to pursue may offer a moreuseful path forward. In cases where a state wishes to respond to a cyber armed attack using force, a strict test of attribution should continue to apply. This minimizes the otherwise grave risk of misdirected retaliation due to the technical obstacles to attribution. If, however, a state seeks redress through nonforcible legal or diplomatic channels instead, these concerns are less significant and the attribution threshold can be lowered.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cThere are, broadly speaking, two aspects to the attribution problem. The first is the technical problem of how to identify the true origin of a particular attack and the identity of those who carried it out. The second is the legal question of whether and if so, when, factual attribution allows a state to be held responsible for the cyberattack under international law.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22203%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.977%2C384.217%2C539.984%2C394.282%5D%2C%5B71.999%2C371.234%2C540.107%2C381.299%5D%2C%5B71.999%2C358.25%2C540.005%2C369.19%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C345.211%2C539.947%2C355.276%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C332.228%2C540.004%2C343.305%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C319.246%2C539.945%2C329.311%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C306.206%2C539.968%2C317.284%5D%2C%5B72%2C293.224%2C540.139%2C303.289%5D%2C%5B72%2C280.242%2C221.467%2C290.307%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22203%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe technical consequences of the unique characteristics of cyberattacks have been widely acknowledged.

These attacks are especially grave and, as such, ones that states will most want to respond to decisively. Understanding the availability and limits of a lawful response is therefore critical. The essay begins by briefly reviewing the current state of international law concerning armed attacks and selfdefense, and whether and how cyberattacks fit within this framework. It then examines the attribution problem, noting that there are both technical and legal hurdles to overcome when attempting to reconcile conventional approaches to attribution with the unconventional characteristics of a cyberattack.

Vincent-Jo\u00ebl Proulx proposed such a model in the context of terrorism.28 Allowing it to authorize acts of self-defense in relation to cyberattacks is, in our view, dangerously flawed due to the risk of misattribution. However, a strict liability approach holds appeal when states are instead pursuing negotiated outcomes through legal means, as the adverse effects of misattribution are significantly reduced. Under this approach an injured state may, for example, be able to use countermeasures against the state from which the cyberattack allegedly originated (assuming the other legal requirements for countermeasures are met),29 even if there was no evidence that the host state had any involvement in the attack beyond its territory being used. A strict liability model also encourages state cooperation by creating potential liability for reparations. When we consider that some estimates have put the potential costs from the previously mentioned WannaCry attack at US$4 billion,30 the strong incentive that this model establishes for states to actively cooperate to prevent cyberattacks is readily apparent.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22204%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.9783004%2C432.23520170000006%2C539.9465637099995%2C442.20129230000003%5D%2C%5B72.00010968999999%2C419.2515743%2C539.9464379399999%2C430.1257223%5D%2C%5B71.99998392000003%2C406.21205576%2C540.0018970299999%2C417.0864223%5D%2C%5B72.00044251%2C393.22995628000007%2C540.0073970800001%2C404.30705698%5D%2C%5B71.99934250000001%2C380.2476382600001%2C287.38809999999995%2C391.1210223%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22204%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTurning to the legal problems of attribution, a state will not be held responsible for an internationally wrongful act unless that act is attributable to the state under international law,16 with the conventional principles of state responsibility applying to cyberattacks.17 The conduct of a nonstate actor may be attributed to a state where the nonstate actor is \u201cacting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of \u201d the state, or where the state acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own.18\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22204%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22205%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.978%2C562.231%2C540.017%2C573.171%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C549.249%2C539.962%2C559.314%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C536.209%2C539.959%2C546.274%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C523.227%2C539.915%2C533.292%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C510.245%2C540.053%2C520.31%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C497.205%2C539.972%2C507.27%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C484.223%2C539.974%2C494.288%5D%2C%5B72.001%2C471.24%2C286.305%2C481.306%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22205%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOne possible response to these challenges is to lower the attribution threshold in cases of cyberattacks.25 If the existing legal framework creates a threshold so high that states have no prospect of attributing responsibility for a cyber armed attack, states will be effectively precluded from any lawful response, including self-defense. This creates a dangerous practical lacuna, and emboldens perpetrators by allowing them to operate with impunity. It is unrealistic to assume that a state in these circumstances would simply not respond to a cyber armed attack. Instead, states will likely respond outside of the existing legal framework. An excessively high attribution threshold ultimately leaves states with no lawful option for self-defense and undermines the rules-based international order by incentivizing covert retaliatory cyber operations.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22205%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22205%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.9779%2C614.2184742999999%2C539.9637634699999%2C625.295575%5D%2C%5B71.99970929000006%2C601.2361562799999%2C539.93736323%2C612.31325698%5D%2C%5B71.99970929%2C588.1964743%2C540.0056914099997%2C599.27373844%5D%2C%5B71.99983685000001%2C575.21415628%2C540.0573918799998%2C585.18024688%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22205%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn any event, regardless of whether \u201ceffective control\u201d or \u201coverall control\u201d ultimately applies, the attribution threshold remains extremely high.

As we have previously observed, there is the risk of escalating tension and conflict from misdirected retaliation due to flawed attribution or, alternatively, precluding law-abiding states from lawfully responding to cyberattacks because the legal prerequisite of attribution is practically impossible to establish.27 Therefore, approaching cases of cyber armed attack using the conventional principles of attribution is unlikely to be helpful, given that the threshold questions cannot realistically be answered. Instead, a more nuanced model that applies variable attribution standards based upon the remedy the victim state chooses to pursue may offer a more</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22206%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C666.206%2C539.95%2C676.271%5D%2C%5B72%2C653.224%2C539.99%2C663.289%5D%2C%5B72%2C640.241%2C539.946%2C650.306%5D%2C%5B72%2C627.202%2C460.136%2C638.279%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%7D\">useful path forward. In cases where a state wishes to respond to a cyber armed attack using force, a strict test of attribution should continue to apply.

This strict liability model is distinct from the due diligence obligation under Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, as it does not establish a separate wrongful act on the part of the host state. Rather, this approach would apply strict liability to questions of attribution where a state has suffered a prohibited use of cyber force but chooses to pursue remedies through nonforcible legal processes rather than forceful retaliation. Used in this way, strict liability avoids the scenario where the injured party could neither protect itself before the fact, nor receive justice after it.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cIn the specific context of cyber armed attacks, however, conventional principles could be adapted by developing a model that varies attribution requirements based upon the victim state\u2019s contemplated response. Such a model would build on existing legal foundations, minimize the risk of misattribution and conflict escalation, and incentivize cooperation between states. It would also go some way towards addressing some of the existing challenges with regards to attribution that this essay has identified.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cThe technical consequences of the unique characteristics of cyberattacks have been widely acknowledged. Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany have highlighted two key differences between cyber and other kinds of attacks: the boundlessness and anonymity of the cyber domain.11 As cyberspace is not limited by physical or geographical borders, questions of jurisdiction and enforcement become more complex. Perpetrators use various techniques to obscure their true location, and isolating the origin of a cyberattack is extraordinarily difficult when attacks are routed through multiple machines in multiple locations across the world. These techniques make the task of retrospectively establishing a forensic link between an attacker and an incident extremely difficult. They allow cyberattacks to be carried out with little risk to those involved, with perpetrators able to mask their identity and potentially even misattribute blame.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cThese technical difficulties have two main consequences for attribution, both of which are critical in relation to cyber armed attacks. The first is that the risk of misattribution is heightened, leading to the potential for seriousconflict escalation if a state mistakenly targets an innocent third party in its self-defense response. The second is that the length of time it will realistically take to correctly identify the perpetrator will very likely mean that it will be significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of self-defense.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204)", "\u201cOn the other hand, lowering the attribution threshold also carries potential dangers. As discussed above, there is a serious risk of misattribution, which has particularly grave consequences in relation to cyber armed attacks, where a state may retaliate in self-defense. Failing to maintain strict attribution requirements gives rise to a significant risk of escalation and conflict.26\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cIn theory, there is no obstacle to a cyberattack reaching the threshold of both a \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack.\u201d A cyberattack will constitute a use of force \u201cwhen its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force.\u201d6 In order to objectively assess whether a cyberattack rises to this level, states likely will consider the severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement, and presumptive legality of the operation.7\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203)", "\u201cIt is critical to establish an attribution standard that strikes the right balance. As we have previously observed, there is the risk of escalating tension and conflict from misdirected retaliation due to flawed attribution or, alternatively, precluding law-abiding states from lawfully responding to cyberattacks because the legal prerequisite of attribution is practically impossible to establish.27 Therefore, approaching cases of cyber armed attack using the conventional principles of attribution is unlikely to be helpful, given that the threshold questions cannot realistically be answered. Instead, a more nuanced model that applies variable attribution standards based upon the remedy the victim state chooses to pursue may offer a moreuseful path forward. In cases where a state wishes to respond to a cyber armed attack using force, a strict test of attribution should continue to apply. This minimizes the otherwise grave risk of misdirected retaliation due to the technical obstacles to attribution. If, however, a state seeks redress through nonforcible legal or diplomatic channels instead, these concerns are less significant and the attribution threshold can be lowered.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cUltimately, when dealing with cyber armed attacks, attribution, and self-defense, the bar is set so high that it will rarely be met practice. The key questions are: has there been an armed attack; have the requirements of selfdefense been established; and can responsibility be attributed to a state? For each question there are significant difficulties with applying conventional principles to cyber armed attacks.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 205)", "\u201cIn late 2018, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security suggested that \u201ccyber-attacks now exceed the risk of physical attacks.\u201d1 Yet the law has not kept pace with this reality. In particular, identifying who is responsible for a cyberattack makes it difficult to regulate this conduct. A state often cannot practically respond to a threat unless it knows from where the threat emanates and potentially who is responsible. Attribution of cyber conduct is critical from a legal perspective because the unlawful act must be attributable to another state for state responsibility to be engaged.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 202)", "\u201cThe conventional principles of self-defense and attribution are poorly suited to dealing with cyber armed attacks. The technical problems of attribution in cyberspace may make it practically impossible for victim states to meet the legal requirements of both attribution and self-defense. Under the current legal framework, states are effectively prevented from utilizing the right to self-defense in response to a cyber armed attack.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cThus, cyberattacks often take more time to detect and evaluate than traditional kinetic attacks. This analysis might require using classified intelligence and technological capabilities that a state would prefer not to reveal.

Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany have highlighted two key differences between cyber and other kinds of attacks: the boundlessness and anonymity of the cyber domain.11 As cyberspace is not limited by physical or geographical borders, questions of jurisdiction and enforcement become more complex. Perpetrators use various techniques to obscure their true location, and isolating the origin of a cyberattack is extraordinarily difficult when attacks are routed through multiple machines in multiple locations across the world. These techniques make the task of retrospectively establishing a forensic link between an attacker and an incident extremely difficult. They allow cyberattacks to be carried out with little risk to those involved, with perpetrators able to mask their identity and potentially even misattribute blame.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22203%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 203</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22203%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.978%2C228.198%2C539.952%2C239.275%5D%2C%5B71.999%2C215.216%2C539.97%2C226.293%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22203%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThese technical difficulties have two main consequences for attribution, both of which are critical in relation to cyber armed attacks.

Rather, this approach would apply strict liability to questions of attribution where a state has suffered a prohibited use of cyber force but chooses to pursue remedies through nonforcible legal processes rather than forceful retaliation. Used in this way, strict liability avoids the scenario where the injured party could neither protect itself before the fact, nor receive justice after it.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)", "\u201cThe principles of attribution relating to the actions of nonstate actors are particularly relevant to cyberattacks, given that \u201cthe relative availability and cheapness of the technology necessary to mount a cyber-attack makes significant attacks launched by private individuals or corporations far more feasible compared with other types of warfare.\u201d19 Attribution here is also critical given the prevailing view that cyberattacks conducted by nonstate actors that are not attributable to states are not a use of force for the purposes of the UN Charter regime.20\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 204)", "\u201cIn late 2018, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security suggested that \u201ccyber-attacks now exceed the risk of physical attacks.\u201d1 Yet the law has not kept pace with this reality.

Vincent-Jo\u00ebl Proulx proposed such a model in the context of terrorism.28 Allowing it to authorize acts of self-defense in relation to cyberattacks is, in our view, dangerously flawed due to the risk of misattribution. However, a strict liability approach holds appeal when states are instead pursuing negotiated outcomes through legal means, as the adverse effects of misattribution are significantly reduced. Under this approach an injured state may, for example, be able to use countermeasures against the state from which the cyberattack allegedly originated (assuming the other legal requirements for countermeasures are met),29 even if there was no evidence that the host state had any involvement in the attack beyond its territory being used. A strict liability model also encourages state cooperation by creating potential liability for reparations. When we consider that some estimates have put the potential costs from the previously mentioned WannaCry attack at US$4 billion,30 the strong incentive that this model establishes for states to actively cooperate to prevent cyberattacks is readily apparent.\u201d (Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22206%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.97912068999997%2C471.2397382600001%2C539.9627841399996%2C481.20582886000005%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C458.20021972000006%2C539.97268423%2C469.27732042%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C445.2179017000001%2C540.1178855500001%2C455.2169926000001%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C432.2355836800001%2C539.9583840999999%2C442.2016742800001%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C419.2532656600001%2C539.9638841499999%2C429.2193562600001%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C406.2137471200001%2C539.9638841499994%2C416.1798377200001%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C393.2314291000001%2C505.7920734999994%2C403.1975197000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe lowered threshold in this context incentivizes host states to cooperate with injured states, particularly if assisting an injured state in collecting evidence and preventing future attacks would help to discharge a host state\u2019s obligations.

Used in this way, strict liability avoids the scenario where the injured party could neither protect itself before the fact, nor receive justice after it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FF2EDWAWU%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22206%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.97709070000002%2C614.2194017%2C539.95635411%2C624.1854923000001%5D%2C%5B71.99889999000001%2C601.2358743%2C539.99743134%2C612.1099223%5D%2C%5B72.00037686000002%2C588.19635576%2C539.9886312599998%2C599.27345646%5D%2C%5B72.00037686000002%2C575.21403774%2C539.9732311199998%2C585.18012834%5D%2C%5B72.00037686000002%2C562.23171972%2C539.9787311699997%2C573.3088204200001%5D%2C%5B71.99927685%2C549.2494017%2C539.94793089%2C559.2154923%5D%2C%5B71.99927685%2C536.2090743%2C539.96412943%2C547.0832223%5D%2C%5B72.00117526000002%2C523.22675628%2C539.9509293099997%2C533.19284688%5D%2C%5B72.00117526000002%2C510.2444382600001%2C539.9619294099997%2C520.2105288600001%5D%2C%5B72.00117526000002%2C497.20437430000004%2C539.97598426%2C508.1352223%5D%2C%5B72.00092997999997%2C484.22205628000006%2C536.2238501499996%2C494.18814688000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOne option would be a strict liability model that holds host states indirectly responsible for breaches occurring within their territory. Vincent-Jo\u00ebl Proulx proposed such a model in the context of terrorism.28 Allowing it to authorize acts of self-defense in relation to cyberattacks is, in our view, dangerously flawed due to the risk of misattribution. However, a strict liability approach holds appeal when states are instead pursuing negotiated outcomes through legal means, as the adverse effects of misattribution are significantly reduced. Under this approach an injured state may, for example, be able to use countermeasures against the state from which the cyberattack allegedly originated (assuming the other legal requirements for countermeasures are met),29 even if there was no evidence that the host state had any involvement in the attack beyond its territory being used. A strict liability model also encourages state cooperation by creating potential liability for reparations. When we consider that some estimates have put the potential costs from the previously mentioned WannaCry attack at US$4 billion,30 the strong incentive that this model establishes for states to actively cooperate to prevent cyberattacks is readily apparent.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY3EEKUDQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22206%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Finlay e Payne, 2019, p. 206</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lorraine Finlay, Christian Payne", "date": "2019", "journal": "AJIL Unbound", "title": "The Attribution Problem and Cyber Armed Attacks", "abstract": "In late 2018, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security suggested that \u201ccyber-attacks now exceed the risk of physical attacks.\u201d Yet the law has not kept pace with this reality.
