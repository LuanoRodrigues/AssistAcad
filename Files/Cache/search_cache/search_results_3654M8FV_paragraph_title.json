In that respect, it should be cautioned that there is at present no universal and coherent body of law that can be described as the international law of evidence. 20 Every international adjudicative organ is subject to its own standards for the production, collection, and evaluation of evidence, some of which are established in their statutes or rules of procedure, while others have evolved through the practice of these tribunals.21 In this article, we focus on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to its undoubted prominence on the international plane as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.22 We believe that this analysis illustrates the extent of flexibility accepted in proving attribution in inter-State disputes. However, it should be borne in mind that other tribunals may well use slightly or markedly different approaches to the procedural issues we discuss, including the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect evidence. By the same token, outside of the judicial context, the \u2018attribution\u2019 of cyber operations might achieve its political aims whether or not it satisfies the legal standards applied by any of these tribunals including the ICJ. In that regard, each State must determine \u2018for itself its legal situation vis-\u00e0-vis other States\u201923 and it is then accountable for any measures taken on the basis of that determination.24\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cDifferent international tribunals have taken different approaches to the question of standard of proof. In the area of international criminal law, the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard has been established as the required standard of proof,98 as reflected in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC): \u2018In order to convict the accused, the Court must be convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.\u2019 99 By contrast, there is no equivalent provision in the ICJ Statute and the ICJ itself has so far refrained from laying down a clear set of rules relating to the standard of proof.100 However, the issues relating to the standard of proof before the ICJ have been addressed to some extent in the scholarly literature and it is possible to draw out some tendencies in the ICJ\u2019s approach on that basis.101\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 14)", "\u201cThis general approach seems to be supported in individual cases of the Court. Accordingly, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ noted that the allegations of genocide, as \u2018charges of exceptional gravity\u2019, had to be \u2018proved by evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019.105 In assessing questions of attribution of specific genocidal acts to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Court then applied a standard approximating the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 criterion.106 In cases concerning the use of armed force, the ICJ seems to have applied the slightly lower \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 standard.107 For example, in Nicaragua, it required that the facts of the claim be supported by convincing evidence.108 By contrast, in cases relating to boundary and maritime delimitation, where the assertions made by parties do not primarily concern allegations of violation of international law, the ICJ seems to apply the \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019 or \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 standard, which is similar to the standard of proof adopted in civil cases in common law.109\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cThe Court has on occasion permitted reliance on indirect and circumstantial evidence.

In that respect, it should be cautioned that there is at present no universal and coherent body of law that can be described as the international law of evidence. 20 Every international adjudicative organ is subject to its own standards for the production, collection, and evaluation of evidence, some of which are established in their statutes or rules of procedure, while others have evolved through the practice of these tribunals.21 In this article, we focus on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to its undoubted prominence on the international plane as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.22 We believe that this analysis illustrates the extent of flexibility accepted in proving attribution in inter-State disputes. However, it should be borne in mind that other tribunals may well use slightly or markedly different approaches to the procedural issues we discuss, including the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect evidence. By the same token, outside of the judicial context, the \u2018attribution\u2019 of cyber operations might achieve its political aims whether or not it satisfies the legal standards applied by any of these tribunals including the ICJ. In that regard, each State must determine \u2018for itself its legal situation vis-\u00e0-vis other States\u201923 and it is then accountable for any measures taken on the basis of that determination.24\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3654M8FV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMR4NZQBF%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B86.184%2C677.582%2C523.152%2C691.082%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C663.062%2C523.004%2C676.562%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C648.422%2C523.354%2C662.138%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C633.902%2C523.48%2C647.402%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C619.262%2C523.318%2C632.978%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C604.742%2C521.472%2C618.242%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C590.222%2C521.614%2C603.938%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C575.582%2C522.956%2C589.082%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C561.062%2C367.03%2C574.778%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3654M8FV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDifferent international tribunals have taken different approaches to the question of standard of proof.

However, it should be borne in mind that other tribunals may well use slightly or markedly different approaches to the procedural issues we discuss, including the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect evidence. By the same token, outside of the judicial context, the \u2018attribution\u2019 of cyber operations might achieve its political aims whether or not it satisfies the legal standards applied by any of these tribunals including the ICJ. In that regard, each State must determine \u2018for itself its legal situation vis-\u00e0-vis other States\u201923 and it is then accountable for any measures taken on the basis of that determination.24\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cThe Court has on occasion permitted reliance on indirect and circumstantial evidence.

Unlike a domestic court or even the ICC, whose States Parties are obliged to cooperate with the ICC under Articles 86, 87 and other provisions of the Rome Statute,114 the ICJ is in a much weaker position when it comes to compelling the parties to provide it with relevant evidence.115 Article 49 of the ICJ Statute reads: \u2018The Court may, even before the hearing begins, call upon the agents to produce any document or to supply any explanations. Formal note shall be taken of any refusal.\u2019 This \u2018cautious wording\u2019 suggests that parties are under no legal obligation to comply with the Court\u2019s requests made under that provision.116 However, the ICJ has held that the parties have a general duty to cooperate in the provision of evidence relevant to the resolution of the dispute before it.117\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 16)", "\u201cThis general approach seems to be supported in individual cases of the Court. Accordingly, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ noted that the allegations of genocide, as \u2018charges of exceptional gravity\u2019, had to be \u2018proved by evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019.105 In assessing questions of attribution of specific genocidal acts to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Court then applied a standard approximating the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 criterion.106 In cases concerning the use of armed force, the ICJ seems to have applied the slightly lower \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 standard.107 For example, in Nicaragua, it required that the facts of the claim be supported by convincing evidence.108 By contrast, in cases relating to boundary and maritime delimitation, where the assertions made by parties do not primarily concern allegations of violation of international law, the ICJ seems to apply the \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019 or \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 standard, which is similar to the standard of proof adopted in civil cases in common law.109\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cTherefore, in our view, the similarities between the various cyber operations and evidence on the use of IP addresses and e-mail accounts could be accorded some probative value if they fulfil these criteria. In this regard, it is interesting to revisit the evidence discussed earlier in this article.122 As noted, the evidence available taken individually is insufficient for the purposes of establishing attribution of the relevant cyber operations to North Korea. However, if the present case was litigated before a tribunal such as the ICJ and the respondent State would not discharge its general duty to cooperate with the Court, it is conceivable that the judges would be more inclined to make further inferences from the evidence taken collectively.123\u201d (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 16)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMR4NZQBF%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B86.184%2C598.741796875%2C522.9120000000003%2C609.7479999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C584.221796875%2C523.3780000000002%2C595.228%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C569.581796875%2C523.396%2C581.8518399999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C555.031796875%2C523.272%2C566.038%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C540.391796875%2C523.3460000000001%2C551.3979999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C525.871796875%2C523.3780000000002%2C538.14184%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C511.231796875%2C523.564%2C522.2379999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C496.711796875%2C523.308%2C508.98184000000003%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C482.191796875%2C523.3000000000001%2C493.19800000000004%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C467.551796875%2C523.1900000000002%2C478.558%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C453.031796875%2C523.2120000000002%2C464.038%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C438.391796875%2C523.14%2C449.398%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C423.871796875%2C523.26%2C434.878%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C409.351796875%2C523.02%2C420.358%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C394.711796875%2C523.1020000000001%2C406.98184000000003%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C380.191796875%2C205.63428%2C392.46184000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3654M8FV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA final preliminary remark is in order as regards the evidentiary standards and rules discussed in this article.
