However, considering the technical challenge involved in collecting evidence relating to the attribution of cyber operations to States that discreetly conduct these operations through proxies, the difficulty of attributing cyber operations to States cannot be underestimated.

The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated: 430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed. It must therefore be concluded that the organs of the Respondent did nothing to prevent the Srebrenica massacres, claiming that they were powerless to do so, which hardly tallies with their known influence over the [Bosnian Serb army].\u201d (Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1033)", "\u201cParagraph 71(g) of the 2021 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) states: [T]he Group recalls that the indication that an ICT [information and communication technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State; and notes that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.

The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated:</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221033%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C653.630244140625%2C467.8998120000002%2C663.42642%5D%2C%5B153%2C641.266764140625%2C467.88993000000033%2C651.17274%5D%2C%5B153%2C628.8483841406251%2C467.89102800000046%2C638.6445600000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C616.4849041406251%2C467.8690680000003%2C626.2810800000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C604.1214241406251%2C467.907498%2C613.9176000000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C591.7579441406251%2C467.89322400000054%2C601.5541200000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C579.3395641406252%2C467.9096940000006%2C589.1357400000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C566.9760841406252%2C467.88444000000015%2C576.7722600000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C554.6126041406252%2C467.93934000000047%2C564.4087800000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C542.2491241406252%2C198.66252599999996%2C552.0453000000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C529.8307441406253%2C165.72581999999997%2C539.6269200000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C517.4672641406253%2C467.95141800000056%2C527.2634400000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C505.1037841406253%2C467.8833420000004%2C514.8999600000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C492.7403041406253%2C467.9437320000005%2C502.5364800000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C480.3219241406253%2C467.96020200000027%2C490.1181000000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C467.9584441406253%2C467.9261640000006%2C477.75462000000033%5D%2C%5B153%2C455.59496414062534%2C321.36732%2C465.39114000000035%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221033%22%7D%7D\">430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . .

On May 28, 2021, the government of Japan submitted its \u201cBasic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\u201d50 to the UN Secretariat in response to the request of the chair of the UNGGE. The Basic Position explains Japan\u2019s position on the Corfu Channel due diligence obligation and refers to jurisprudence relating to various rules of international law containing the element of due diligence.51 Such jurisprudence might not directly apply to cyber operations but assists our understanding of the nature of the due diligence obligation. The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated: 430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed.

On May 28, 2021, the government of Japan submitted its \u201cBasic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\u201d50 to the UN Secretariat in response to the request of the chair of the UNGGE.

The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated:</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221033%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C653.630244140625%2C467.8998120000002%2C663.42642%5D%2C%5B153%2C641.266764140625%2C467.88993000000033%2C651.17274%5D%2C%5B153%2C628.8483841406251%2C467.89102800000046%2C638.6445600000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C616.4849041406251%2C467.8690680000003%2C626.2810800000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C604.1214241406251%2C467.907498%2C613.9176000000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C591.7579441406251%2C467.89322400000054%2C601.5541200000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C579.3395641406252%2C467.9096940000006%2C589.1357400000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C566.9760841406252%2C467.88444000000015%2C576.7722600000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C554.6126041406252%2C467.93934000000047%2C564.4087800000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C542.2491241406252%2C198.66252599999996%2C552.0453000000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C529.8307441406253%2C165.72581999999997%2C539.6269200000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C517.4672641406253%2C467.95141800000056%2C527.2634400000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C505.1037841406253%2C467.8833420000004%2C514.8999600000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C492.7403041406253%2C467.9437320000005%2C502.5364800000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C480.3219241406253%2C467.96020200000027%2C490.1181000000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C467.9584441406253%2C467.9261640000006%2C477.75462000000033%5D%2C%5B153%2C455.59496414062534%2C321.36732%2C465.39114000000035%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221033%22%7D%7D\">430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed. It must therefore be concluded that the organs of the Respondent did nothing to prevent the Srebrenica massacres, claiming that they were powerless to do so, which hardly tallies with their known influence over the [Bosnian Serb army].\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221033%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1033</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221020%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C361.161796875%2C485.9892000000001%2C371.868%5D%2C%5B135%2C347.661796875%2C486.04200000000003%2C358.368%5D%2C%5B135%2C334.161796875%2C486.00120000000015%2C344.868%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221020%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMore recently, on July 16, 2020, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada jointly published an advisory that attributed cyber espionage targeting COVID-19 vaccine development to \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threats</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221021%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B135%2C652.521796875%2C485.916%2C664.5955799999999%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C639.021796875%2C485.91960000000006%2C649.728%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C625.521796875%2C485.9676000000001%2C636.228%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C612.021796875%2C485.90520000000004%2C622.728%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999991%2C598.521796875%2C485.9759999999999%2C609.228%5D%2C%5B134.9999999999999%2C585.021796875%2C485.9399999999999%2C595.728%5D%2C%5B134.9999999999999%2C571.521796875%2C469.37237999999996%2C583.5955799999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221021%22%7D%7D\">(APT) 29.\u201d5 The advisory stated: \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) assess that APT29 is a cyber espionage group, almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services.

On May 28, 2021, the government of Japan submitted its \u201cBasic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\u201d50 to the UN Secretariat in response to the request of the chair of the UNGGE. The Basic Position explains Japan\u2019s position on the Corfu Channel due diligence obligation and refers to jurisprudence relating to various rules of international law containing the element of due diligence.51 Such jurisprudence might not directly apply to cyber operations but assists our understanding of the nature of the due diligence obligation. The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated: 430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed. It must therefore be concluded that the organs of the Respondent did nothing to prevent the Srebrenica massacres, claiming that they were powerless to do so, which hardly tallies with their known influence over the [Bosnian Serb army].\u201d (Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1033)", "\u201cMore recently, on July 16, 2020, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada jointly published an advisory that attributed cyber espionage targeting COVID-19 vaccine development to \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threats (APT) 29.\u201d5 The advisory stated: \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) assess that APT29 is a cyber espionage group, almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) agrees with this attribution and the details provided in this report.\u201d Following the joint advisory, the UK Foreign Secretary condemned Russian intelligence services for targeting those working to combat COVID-19.6\u201d (Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1021)", "\u201cParagraph 71(g) of the 2021 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) states: [T]he Group recalls that the indication that an ICT [information and communication technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State; and notes that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.

On May 28, 2021, the government of Japan submitted its \u201cBasic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\u201d50 to the UN Secretariat in response to the request of the chair of the UNGGE.

The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated:</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221033%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C653.630244140625%2C467.8998120000002%2C663.42642%5D%2C%5B153%2C641.266764140625%2C467.88993000000033%2C651.17274%5D%2C%5B153%2C628.8483841406251%2C467.89102800000046%2C638.6445600000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C616.4849041406251%2C467.8690680000003%2C626.2810800000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C604.1214241406251%2C467.907498%2C613.9176000000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C591.7579441406251%2C467.89322400000054%2C601.5541200000001%5D%2C%5B153%2C579.3395641406252%2C467.9096940000006%2C589.1357400000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C566.9760841406252%2C467.88444000000015%2C576.7722600000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C554.6126041406252%2C467.93934000000047%2C564.4087800000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C542.2491241406252%2C198.66252599999996%2C552.0453000000002%5D%2C%5B153%2C529.8307441406253%2C165.72581999999997%2C539.6269200000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C517.4672641406253%2C467.95141800000056%2C527.2634400000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C505.1037841406253%2C467.8833420000004%2C514.8999600000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C492.7403041406253%2C467.9437320000005%2C502.5364800000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C480.3219241406253%2C467.96020200000027%2C490.1181000000003%5D%2C%5B153%2C467.9584441406253%2C467.9261640000006%2C477.75462000000033%5D%2C%5B153%2C455.59496414062534%2C321.36732%2C465.39114000000035%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221033%22%7D%7D\">430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed. It must therefore be concluded that the organs of the Respondent did nothing to prevent the Srebrenica massacres, claiming that they were powerless to do so, which hardly tallies with their known influence over the [Bosnian Serb army].\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221033%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1033</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221020%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153%2C361.161796875%2C485.9892000000001%2C371.868%5D%2C%5B135%2C347.661796875%2C486.04200000000003%2C358.368%5D%2C%5B135%2C334.161796875%2C486.00120000000015%2C344.868%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221020%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMore recently, on July 16, 2020, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada jointly published an advisory that attributed cyber espionage targeting COVID-19 vaccine development to \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threats</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7VTLMIPS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221021%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B135%2C652.521796875%2C485.916%2C664.5955799999999%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C639.021796875%2C485.91960000000006%2C649.728%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C625.521796875%2C485.9676000000001%2C636.228%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999997%2C612.021796875%2C485.90520000000004%2C622.728%5D%2C%5B134.99999999999991%2C598.521796875%2C485.9759999999999%2C609.228%5D%2C%5B134.9999999999999%2C585.021796875%2C485.9399999999999%2C595.728%5D%2C%5B134.9999999999999%2C571.521796875%2C469.37237999999996%2C583.5955799999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ASBYUZD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221021%22%7D%7D\">(APT) 29.\u201d5 The advisory stated: \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) assess that APT29 is a cyber espionage group, almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services.

On May 28, 2021, the government of Japan submitted its \u201cBasic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations\u201d50 to the UN Secretariat in response to the request of the chair of the UNGGE. The Basic Position explains Japan\u2019s position on the Corfu Channel due diligence obligation and refers to jurisprudence relating to various rules of international law containing the element of due diligence.51 Such jurisprudence might not directly apply to cyber operations but assists our understanding of the nature of the due diligence obligation. The 1872 Alabama arbitral award pointed out that due diligence ought to be exercised by neutral governments in proportion to the risk.52 The 2007 Bosnian Genocide judgment characterized the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention as one of due diligence and found that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had violated the obligation by failing to use its capacity to influence the Bosnian Serb army.53 In this judgment, the ICJ stated: 430. . . . In this area the notion of \u201cdue diligence\u201d, which calls for an assessment in concreto, is of critical importance. Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned. The first, which varies greatly from one State to another, is clearly the capacity to influence effectively the action of persons likely to commit, or already committing, genocide. This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . . Yet the Respondent has not shown that it took any initiative to prevent what happened, or any action on its part to avert the atrocities which were committed. It must therefore be concluded that the organs of the Respondent did nothing to prevent the Srebrenica massacres, claiming that they were powerless to do so, which hardly tallies with their known influence over the [Bosnian Serb army].\u201d (Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1033)", "\u201cMore recently, on July 16, 2020, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada jointly published an advisory that attributed cyber espionage targeting COVID-19 vaccine development to \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threats (APT) 29.\u201d5 The advisory stated: \u201cThe United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) assess that APT29 is a cyber espionage group, almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) agrees with this attribution and the details provided in this report.\u201d Following the joint advisory, the UK Foreign Secretary condemned Russian intelligence services for targeting those working to combat COVID-19.6\u201d (Mikanagi, 2021, p. 1021)", "\u201cParagraph 71(g) of the 2021 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (UNGGE) states: [T]he Group recalls that the indication that an ICT [information and communication technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State; and notes that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.

Various parameters operate when assessing whether a State has duly discharged the obligation concerned.

This capacity itself depends, among other things, on the geographical distance of the State concerned from the scene of the events, and on the strength of the political links, as well as links of all other kinds, between the authorities of that State and the main actors in the events. ... 438. . . .
