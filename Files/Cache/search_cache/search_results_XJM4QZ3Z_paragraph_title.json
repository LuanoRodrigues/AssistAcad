This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form.

It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 107)", "\u201cIt is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.174\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)", "\u201cThe fact that the Court requires different evidentiary standards depending on the level of seriousness of the breach became most evident in its Bosnian Genocide judgment.53 In that case, the Court highlighted the difference between proving the commission of genocide and proving the failure to prevent genocide, as well as to punish and extradite persons charged with the crime of genocide.54 While the Court stated that it requires fully conclusive evidence for charges of exceptional gravity and has to be fully convinced that the act of genocide was committed by the respondent, it pointed out that it \u2018only\u2019 requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation for other charges than of exceptional gravity.55 This was the case with proving that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia failed to prevent the commission of genocide,56 which is consequently a less severe violation of international law compared to the commission of genocide. Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.57 While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between \u2013 in what seems like \u2013 a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court\u2019s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court\u2019s approach to use terms such as \u2018convincing/convinced\u2019,58 \u2018conclusive\u2019,59 \u2018sufficient\u201960 and \u2018insufficient/not sufficient evidence\u201961 rather confusable so far instead of explaining which specific standard it applies to find the facts of an allegation established.62 The inconsistency in its method can also be seen in the fact that the ICJ mentions different standards in the same judgment, as can be seen in Corfu Channel.63 Nevertheless, it must be noted that this case is significant in the sense that it helps to identify two standards which are not appropriate in state responsibility cases.\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 85)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\"

Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.57 While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between \u2013 in what seems like \u2013 a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court\u2019s other case law.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,172 thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.173\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)", "\u201cCyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.158 Section 5.1 thus seeks to shine some light on whether or not the Court would be inclined to shift the burden of proof in the cyber context. Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.159 For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that \u2013 as an alternative solution \u2013 the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 98)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these \u2018hostile uses of cyberspace\u2019101 amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.102 In the authors\u2019 opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state\u2019s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these \u2018attacks\u2019 to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-\u2018attack\u2019, being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term \u2018armed attack\u2019, triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.103\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 90)", "\u201cCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)", "\u201cWhen discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.44 Most importantly, the two should not be confused.

Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,45 namely \u2018to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim\u2019.46 Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.47 In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court48 or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to \u2018[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]\u2019.49 Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.50 In cases concerning state responsibility,51 the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.52\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2283%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner et al., 2019, p. 83</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "I Brunner, M Dobric, V Pirker, T Tiittala", "date": "2019", "journal": null, "title": "Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack: Evidentiary Standards before the ICJ", "abstract": "In 2017, the Internet dominates a large part of the worldwide population.

Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,172 thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.173\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these \u2018hostile uses of cyberspace\u2019101 amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.102 In the authors\u2019 opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state\u2019s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these \u2018attacks\u2019 to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-\u2018attack\u2019, being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term \u2018armed attack\u2019, triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.103\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 90)", "\u201cCyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.158 Section 5.1 thus seeks to shine some light on whether or not the Court would be inclined to shift the burden of proof in the cyber context. Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.159 For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that \u2013 as an alternative solution \u2013 the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 98)", "\u201cCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US.

One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US.

However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act. Therefore, calls have been made to shift the burden of proof or to lower the evidentiary standard required by the Court. In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not. Additionally, the present authors will address a yet in the cyber-context unexplored, but nevertheless, important tool in collecting sufficient evidence: the power of the Court to appoint experts.", "doi": null, "item_type": "bookSection", "url": "", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "75-107", "short_title": "", "item_id": "XJM4QZ3Z", "citation_key": "brunnerProvingStatesInvolvement2019", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/NI86Q5E9", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 242521}}], "keywords": ["#burden_of_proof #cyber-attacks #cyber_operations #ICJ #Brunner_et_al", "#cyber-attacks #international_law_violation #state_sovereignty_infringement #Brunner_et_al #prohibition_of_the_threat_or_use_of_force #principle_of_non-intervention", "#cyber-attacks #evidentiary_burdens #circumstantial_evidence #ICJ #Brunner_et_al #inherent_powers #production_of_evidence", "#governmental_infrastructures #Distributed_Denial_of_Service_attacks #cyber_hack_US_Democratic_National_Committee #NotPetya_attack #Natanz_nuclear_facility_attack #Estonia #Georgia #US_Democratic_National_Committee #Ukraine #Iran #cyber_operations #DDoS_attacks #cyber_hack #large-scale_cyber_operations #infected_USB_device"], "score": [3.5, 1.833, 1.75, 1.25]}, "Indirect Evidence AND Cyber Operations": {"paragraph_id": [15429521, 60463743, 27182969, 78285643], "section_title": ["5.

One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US.

Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.159 For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that \u2013 as an alternative solution \u2013 the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 98)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form.

This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)", "\u201cCyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.158 Section 5.1 thus seeks to shine some light on whether or not the Court would be inclined to shift the burden of proof in the cyber context. Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.159 For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that \u2013 as an alternative solution \u2013 the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 98)", "\u201cIn light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain characteristics of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,172 thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.173\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these \u2018hostile uses of cyberspace\u2019101 amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.102 In the authors\u2019 opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state\u2019s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these \u2018attacks\u2019 to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-\u2018attack\u2019, being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term \u2018armed attack\u2019, triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.103\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 90)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNI86Q5E9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2276%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B157.6123%2C570.7138%2C470.59529999999995%2C581.0538%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C557.7139999999999%2C470.58429999999987%2C568.054%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C544.7141999999999%2C470.5842999999998%2C555.0541999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C531.7143999999998%2C470.5952999999998%2C542.0543999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C518.7137%2C470.6247000000002%2C530.3836%5D%2C%5B146.6131%2C505.7139%2C470.5960999999996%2C516.0539%5D%2C%5B146.6131%2C492.71410000000003%2C470.58509999999984%2C503.0541%5D%2C%5B146.6131%2C479.71430000000004%2C470.64009999999985%2C490.0543%5D%2C%5B146.6131%2C466.71450000000004%2C470.6038%2C477.0545%5D%2C%5B146.61309999999992%2C453.7136%2C470.6120999999998%2C465.38349999999997%5D%2C%5B146.61260000000004%2C440.7138%2C470.6066000000002%2C451.05379999999997%5D%2C%5B146.61260000000004%2C427.714%2C470.59560000000033%2C438.054%5D%2C%5B146.61260000000004%2C414.7142%2C470.6065999999999%2C425.0542%5D%2C%5B146.61260000000004%2C401.7144%2C293.21860000000004%2C413.38329999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2276%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages.

This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)", "\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form.

This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2276%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNI86Q5E9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2289%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B124.4072%2C395.7554%2C448.3572%2C406.0954%5D%2C%5B124.4072%2C382.7554%2C448.4075000000001%2C394.4253%5D%2C%5B124.408%2C369.7554%2C448.40260000000006%2C381.4253%5D%2C%5B124.40750000000003%2C356.7556%2C448.39050000000015%2C367.0956%5D%2C%5B124.40750000000003%2C343.7558%2C448.4015000000002%2C354.0958%5D%2C%5B124.40750000000003%2C330.75600000000003%2C448.34650000000016%2C341.096%5D%2C%5B124.40750000000003%2C317.75620000000004%2C448.3575%2C328.0962%5D%2C%5B124.40750000000003%2C304.75640000000004%2C448.42460000000005%2C315.0964%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2289%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form.

In this article, the present authors will assess the relevant case law of the Court and apply it to two scenarios: a cyber-attack violating the prohibition of use of force and the non-intervention principle. The aim is to display the Court's line of reasoning and assess whether the scholarly demands to ease evidentiary issues, by shifting the burden or lowering the standard of proof, are justified or not.

Despite its vast benefits, however, it has also been used to cause severe damage to states. Hostile cyber activities seem to have occurred more frequently over the past years. It is already recognised that international law - thus also the law on state responsibility - is applicable to cyber-related issues. However, particularly in the context of inter-state relations, the question of how states are able to seek reparation in front of the International Court of Justice for damage caused by a cyber-attack conducted by a state remains open to debate. This is primarily due to the fact that the cyber sphere enjoys a considerable amount of anonymity, which makes it hard to establish the main perpetrator behind an act.

This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state\u2019s sovereignty.185 The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court\u2019s inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102)", "\u201cFirst, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.187 However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.188 For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.189 The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 103)", "\u201cLegal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example \u2018fully conclusive\u2019 in the case of genocide).206 However, the present authors argue that \u2013 in the cyber context \u2013 not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania\u2019s international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.207 This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court\u2019s fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua \u2013 the first appointment in over 30 years \u2013 might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.208\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 106)", "\u201cAs discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.186 However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court\u2019s more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102)", "\u201cBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.39 Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court\u2019s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.40 Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that \u2018[...] the method of handling the evidence [...] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained [...].\u201941 The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.42 This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court\u2019s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.43\u201d (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 82)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNI86Q5E9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22102%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B157.6123%2C634.2509%2C470.6283%2C644.5909%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C621.2511%2C470.63709999999975%2C631.5911%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C608.2512999999999%2C470.62829999999985%2C618.5912999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C595.2514999999999%2C470.6173%2C605.5914999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C582.2516999999998%2C470.6172999999998%2C592.5916999999998%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C569.2508%2C470.6324999999998%2C580.9207%5D%2C%5B146.6121%2C556.251%2C470.59510000000023%2C566.591%5D%2C%5B146.6121%2C543.2511999999999%2C454.8980999999998%2C553.5912%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22102%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court\u2019s involvement.

Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.186 However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court\u2019s more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22102%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNI86Q5E9%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2282%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B157.6123%2C634.2515999999998%2C470.6063000000001%2C644.5915999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6123%2C621.2517999999998%2C470.6129%2C632.9208%5D%2C%5B146.6134%2C608.2511%2C470.6513999999999%2C618.5911%5D%2C%5B146.6134%2C595.2512999999999%2C470.6184000000001%2C605.5912999999999%5D%2C%5B146.6134%2C582.2508%2C470.60469999999987%2C593.9207%5D%2C%5B146.61290000000002%2C569.251%2C470.62010000000026%2C579.591%5D%2C%5B146.61290000000002%2C556.2511999999999%2C471.5419000000003%2C566.5912%5D%2C%5B146.61290000000002%2C543.2507%2C470.6164999999997%2C554.9206%5D%2C%5B146.6126%2C530.2509%2C470.59559999999976%2C540.5909%5D%2C%5B146.6126%2C517.2511%2C470.5516000000002%2C527.5911%5D%2C%5B146.6126%2C504.2507%2C470.6353999999997%2C515.9205000000001%5D%2C%5B146.6128%2C491.2509%2C470.6332%2C501.5909%5D%2C%5B146.6128%2C478.2511%2C306.4286%2C489.9205%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%7D\">\u201cBefore examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.39 Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court\u2019s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.40 Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that \u2018[...] the method of handling the evidence [...] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained [...].\u201941 The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.42 This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court\u2019s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.43\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FXJM4QZ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2282%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner et al., 2019, p. 82</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "I Brunner, M Dobric, V Pirker, T Tiittala", "date": "2019", "journal": null, "title": "Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack: Evidentiary Standards before the ICJ", "abstract": "In 2017, the Internet dominates a large part of the worldwide population.
