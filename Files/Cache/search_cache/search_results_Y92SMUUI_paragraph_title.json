Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways. First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.789%2C282.211775%2C370.76800975999987%2C292.21187499999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C270.53265820999997%2C370.73900946999964%2C279.31274600999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C258.23053518999996%2C370.73500942999976%2C268.23063518999993%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999995%2C246.21177500000002%2C370.7848947199999%2C256.211875%5D%2C%5B59.81078501000002%2C234.19265481000002%2C370.7683403699998%2C244.19275481000003%5D%2C%5B59.81023081999999%2C222.23075538%2C370.70233971%2C232.23085538%5D%2C%5B59.80923081000003%2C210.21177500000002%2C370.77674482%2C220.21187500000002%5D%2C%5B59.81063518999997%2C198.19265481000002%2C370.77172886999966%2C208.19275481000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecond, a series of \u2018soft law\u2019 instruments have been produced, which endorse the taking of due diligence measures to prevent harmful cyber operations.

First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B182.72857884999993%2C294.23031499999996%2C249.87025000000003%2C304.23041499999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 665</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "L Chircop", "date": "2018", "journal": "International & Comparative Law Quarterly", "title": "A DUE DILIGENCE STANDARD OF ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE", "abstract": "The technical and legal challenges of attribution in cyberspace prevent the meaningful operation of the international law framework of State responsibility.

On the contrary, as due diligence is a general principle, \u2018the presumption is that it applies unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it\u2019.54 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 contains a detailed and helpful analysis of how due diligence should be applied in cyberspace.55 It is worthwhile briefly mapping out the principle\u2019s content, given that a natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for States. As the following analysis will demonstrate, a State will only breach its obligation of due diligence in narrowly defined circumstances. In a sense, each element of the principle acts as a reasonable limitation on potential State responsibility. Specifically, a State will only fail to exercise due diligence when it has (1) knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, which is (2) contrary to the rights of another State, and it (3) fails to take feasible measures to prevent it.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 650)", "\u201cFinally, international courts have repeatedly engaged with novel arguments concerning the State responsibility framework. While judicial decisions are a \u2018subsidiary\u2019 source of international law,131 pronouncements on issues of substance by the ICJ are generally considered to be of \u2018great weight\u2019.132 As such, the Court\u2019s willingness to accept new standards of attribution in appropriate circumstances is particularly instructive. It has done so on at least two occasions, in its Corfu Channel and Armed Activities decisions.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 660)", "\u201cSecond, some have advocated for a relaxed standard of proof to accommodate the exigencies of the cyber context.47 This argument can also be rejected. Standards of proof exist \u2018not to disadvantage\u2019 States harmed by cyber operations, \u2018but to protect ... against false attribution\u2019.48 As such, there is no reason \u2018why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach\u2019.49 Furthermore, international courts have adopted increasingly consistent standards of proof when dealing with the same internationally wrongful acts.50 On this basis, it is unlikely that a lower standard of proof would be adopted in the case of a cyber attack amounting to a use of force than would be adopted in the case of a kinetic attack violating the same principle. In contrast to evidential standards, the laws of State responsibility are flexible and responsive to different practical contexts.51 As such, they offer the best vehicle for addressing the limitations of attribution in the cyberspace.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 649)", "\u201cIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ again took the opportunity to consider novel submissions concerning attribution. In this instance, the Court seemed to endorse a \u2018toleration\u2019 or \u2018acquiescence\u2019 standard for attributing uses of force to States. Specifically, it observed that two paragraphs of the Friendly Relations Declaration, which prohibited \u2018tolerat[ing]\u2019 or \u2018acquiescing in\u2019 acts constituting the use of force or civil strife, were \u2018declaratory of customary international law\u2019.140 This standard was then employed by the Court when assessing whether Congolese authorities had committed a use of force in supporting anti-Ugandan insurgents.141 The ICJ concluded that, on the available evidence, it could not consider the Congo to have tolerated or acquiesced in the insurgent\u2019s activities.142 In the alternative, it observed that Uganda had carried out an illegal use of force against the Congo on 7 August 1998, and any subsequent military action by Congolese authorities was justified as action taken in self-defence.143 In either case, the ICJ seems to have prima facie accepted the operation of a toleration or acquiescence standard for attributing uses of force.144\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 662)", "\u201cWhile the Court limited the toleration or acquiescence standard of attribution to uses of force in Armed Activities, it need not have done so. The Friendly Relations Declaration similarly requires States to act with vigilance to avoid intervention in another State\u2019s domestic affairs, territorial integrity, or sovereignty.145 Furthermore, because Armed Activities was decided in 2005, four years after the completion of the Articles on State Responsibility, the decision lends support to the view that the Articles are inherently flexible. Given changes to the nature of interstate conflict as contemplated by the ILC during the drafting process, it is comprehensible that the cyber context might demand the application of new legal rules. If this is the case, a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace would not be antithetical to the Articles on State Responsibility. On the contrary, it would be entirely consistent with its text and historical treatment by international courts.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 662)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22649%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.811%2C306.192875%2C370.7491093499995%2C316.192975%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999999%2C294.23075538%2C370.7681095399999%2C304.23085538%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999998%2C282.21163519%2C370.7681095399996%2C292.21173518999996%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999998%2C270.19251499999996%2C370.77652595999996%2C280.19261499999993%5D%2C%5B59.81041633000001%2C258.57075878%2C370.7115253099999%2C267.35084658%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22649%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDue diligence reflects a general principle of international law best articulated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Corfu Channel judgment: \u2018it is every State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u2019.52 Since Corfu Channel, due diligence has been particularized in various specialized regimes of</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22650%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.5705783999999%2C382.44414779%2C592.091492%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C570.55145821%2C382.3681470299999%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C558.19233462%2C382.4331476799995%2C568.1924346200001%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C546.230215%2C382.3966791599999%2C556.2303150000001%5D%2C%5B71.43256954999998%2C534.55145821%2C382.36755450999993%2C544.1292920000001%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C522.1925548099999%2C382.2995538299994%2C532.19265481%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C510.57043859000004%2C382.4095549299995%2C519.35052639%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C498.5513184%2C382.3095539299995%2C507.3314062%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C486.53219821%2C382.4055548899998%2C495.31228601%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C474.23007519%2C382.3875547099997%2C484.23017518999995%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C462.21095499999996%2C382.3265540999999%2C472.21105499999993%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C450.53183820999993%2C382.3405542399995%2C459.3119260099999%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C438.5697185899999%2C382.4065548999997%2C447.3498063899999%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C426.5505983999999%2C382.37055453999966%2C435.3306861999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22650%22%7D%7D\">international law.53 This does not, however, preclude application of the principle in new or novel contexts. On the contrary, as due diligence is a general principle, \u2018the presumption is that it applies unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it\u2019.54 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 contains a detailed and helpful analysis of how due diligence should be applied in cyberspace.55 It is worthwhile briefly mapping out the principle\u2019s content, given that a natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for States. As the following analysis will demonstrate, a State will only breach its obligation of due diligence in narrowly defined circumstances. In a sense, each element of the principle acts as a reasonable limitation on potential State responsibility. Specifically, a State will only fail to exercise due diligence when it has (1) knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, which is (2) contrary to the rights of another State, and it (3) fails to take feasible measures to prevent it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22650%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 650</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22660%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.43320754000001%2C306.5327180299999%2C382.34931666999995%2C315.3128058299999%5D%2C%5B71.43320754000001%2C294.5705984099999%2C382.40931726999963%2C303.3506862099999%5D%2C%5B71.43320754000001%2C282.21147481999986%2C382.3487399799995%2C292.21157481999984%5D%2C%5B71.43263084999998%2C270.19265480999996%2C382.38821163%2C280.19275480999994%5D%2C%5B71.43210210000001%2C258.23075538%2C382.34121115999955%2C268.23085538%5D%2C%5B71.4321021%2C246.55163859%2C382.3722114699996%2C255.33172639%5D%2C%5B71.4321021%2C234.53251840000001%2C342.6598143499999%2C243.3126062%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22660%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, international courts have repeatedly engaged with novel arguments concerning the State responsibility framework.

Standards of proof exist \u2018not to disadvantage\u2019 States harmed by cyber operations, \u2018but to protect ... against false attribution\u2019.48 As such, there is no reason \u2018why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach\u2019.49 Furthermore, international courts have adopted increasingly consistent standards of proof when dealing with the same internationally wrongful acts.50 On this basis, it is unlikely that a lower standard of proof would be adopted in the case of a cyber attack amounting to a use of force than would be adopted in the case of a kinetic attack violating the same principle.

Specifically, it observed that two paragraphs of the Friendly Relations Declaration, which prohibited \u2018tolerat[ing]\u2019 or \u2018acquiescing in\u2019 acts constituting the use of force or civil strife, were \u2018declaratory of customary international law\u2019.140 This standard was then employed by the Court when assessing whether Congolese authorities had committed a use of force in supporting anti-Ugandan insurgents.141 The ICJ concluded that, on the available evidence, it could not consider the Congo to have tolerated or acquiesced in the insurgent\u2019s activities.142 In the alternative, it observed that Uganda had carried out an illegal use of force against the Congo on 7 August 1998, and any subsequent military action by Congolese authorities was justified</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22662%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.5705783999999%2C382.3720288999997%2C592.091492%5D%2C%5B71.43291954%2C570.55145821%2C382.34202859999976%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43291954%2C558.53233802%2C180.02465000000004%2C568.110392%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22662%22%7D%7D\">as action taken in self-defence.143 In either case, the ICJ seems to have prima facie accepted the operation of a toleration or acquiescence standard for attributing uses of force.144\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22662%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 662</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22662%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.411%2C546.5705783999999%2C382.33900924999955%2C555.3506662%5D%2C%5B71.43290022000001%2C534.55145821%2C382.3170090299998%2C543.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43190020999998%2C522.53233802%2C382.4080099399998%2C531.31242582%5D%2C%5B71.43190020999998%2C510.2302150000001%2C382.36900954999965%2C520.2303150000001%5D%2C%5B71.43290022%2C498.5510982100001%2C382.37776936%2C508.129292%5D%2C%5B71.43165993000002%2C486.53255821%2C382.39976958000005%2C495.31264601%5D%2C%5B71.43165993000002%2C474.23043519%2C382.39576954%2C484.23053518999996%5D%2C%5B71.43165993000002%2C462.21131499999996%2C382.32976887999973%2C472.21141499999993%5D%2C%5B71.43265994000004%2C450.53219820999993%2C382.3487690699999%2C459.3122860099999%5D%2C%5B71.43265994000004%2C438.5700785899999%2C382.40476962999963%2C447.3501663899999%5D%2C%5B71.43265994000004%2C426.5509583999999%2C382.34676904999947%2C435.3310461999999%5D%2C%5B71.43265994000004%2C414.5318382099999%2C382.3127687099996%2C423.31192600999987%5D%2C%5B71.43265994000004%2C402.56971858999987%2C289.3088386799999%2C411.34980638999986%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22662%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile the Court limited the toleration or acquiescence standard of attribution to uses of force in Armed Activities, it need not have done so. The Friendly Relations Declaration similarly requires States to act with vigilance to avoid intervention in another State\u2019s domestic affairs, territorial integrity, or sovereignty.145 Furthermore, because Armed Activities was decided in 2005, four years after the completion of the Articles on State Responsibility, the decision lends support to the view that the Articles are inherently flexible. Given changes to the nature of interstate conflict as contemplated by the ILC during the drafting process, it is comprehensible that the cyber context might demand the application of new legal rules. If this is the case, a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace would not be antithetical to the Articles on State Responsibility.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports.

First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.789%2C282.211775%2C370.76800975999987%2C292.21187499999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C270.53265820999997%2C370.73900946999964%2C279.31274600999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C258.23053518999996%2C370.73500942999976%2C268.23063518999993%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999995%2C246.21177500000002%2C370.7848947199999%2C256.211875%5D%2C%5B59.81078501000002%2C234.19265481000002%2C370.7683403699998%2C244.19275481000003%5D%2C%5B59.81023081999999%2C222.23075538%2C370.70233971%2C232.23085538%5D%2C%5B59.80923081000003%2C210.21177500000002%2C370.77674482%2C220.21187500000002%5D%2C%5B59.81063518999997%2C198.19265481000002%2C370.77172886999966%2C208.19275481000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecond, a series of \u2018soft law\u2019 instruments have been produced, which endorse the taking of due diligence measures to prevent harmful cyber operations.

Standards of proof exist \u2018not to disadvantage\u2019 States harmed by cyber operations, \u2018but to protect ... against false attribution\u2019.48 As such, there is no reason \u2018why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach\u2019.49 Furthermore, international courts have adopted increasingly consistent standards of proof when dealing with the same internationally wrongful acts.50 On this basis, it is unlikely that a lower standard of proof would be adopted in the case of a cyber attack amounting to a use of force than would be adopted in the case of a kinetic attack violating the same principle. In contrast to evidential standards, the laws of State responsibility are flexible and responsive to different practical contexts.51 As such, they offer the best vehicle for addressing the limitations of attribution in the cyberspace.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 649)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cSecond, a series of \u2018soft law\u2019 instruments have been produced, which endorse the taking of due diligence measures to prevent harmful cyber operations. Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports.

First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22649%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.789%2C510.5705784%2C370.6910089899997%2C519.3506662%5D%2C%5B59.81090022%2C498.55145820999996%2C370.80235443999953%2C508.129292%5D%2C%5B59.81024454999999%2C486.19255481%2C370.7843542599999%2C496.19265480999996%5D%2C%5B59.81024454999999%2C474.23043519%2C370.7042719199999%2C484.23053518999996%5D%2C%5B59.810163010000025%2C462.21145480999996%2C370.7732726099997%2C472.21155480999994%5D%2C%5B59.810163010000025%2C450.19233461999994%2C370.7570835199992%2C460.1924346199999%5D%2C%5B59.81097409%2C438.57065878%2C370.7120830699998%2C447.35074657999996%5D%2C%5B59.81097409%2C426.55153858999995%2C370.7540419799994%2C436.129392%5D%2C%5B59.810932580000014%2C414.53255821%2C370.75204196%2C423.31264601%5D%2C%5B59.810932580000014%2C402.57043859%2C370.7440418799996%2C411.35052638999997%5D%2C%5B59.810932580000014%2C390.55131839999996%2C370.7480419199995%2C399.33140619999995%5D%2C%5B59.810932580000014%2C378.19219480999993%2C370.7490419299999%2C388.1922948099999%5D%2C%5B59.81093257999996%2C366.230675%2C370.7282431299997%2C376.230775%5D%2C%5B59.81113398999999%2C354.55155821%2C186.28539872%2C363.33164601%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22649%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecond, some have advocated for a relaxed standard of proof to accommodate the exigencies of the cyber context.47 This argument can also be rejected. Standards of proof exist \u2018not to disadvantage\u2019 States harmed by cyber operations, \u2018but to protect ... against false attribution\u2019.48 As such, there is no reason \u2018why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach\u2019.49 Furthermore, international courts have adopted increasingly consistent standards of proof when dealing with the same internationally wrongful acts.50 On this basis, it is unlikely that a lower standard of proof would be adopted in the case of a cyber attack amounting to a use of force than would be adopted in the case of a kinetic attack violating the same principle. In contrast to evidential standards, the laws of State responsibility are flexible and responsive to different practical contexts.51 As such, they offer the best vehicle for addressing the limitations of attribution in the cyberspace.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22649%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 649</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22651%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.81074032000001%2C192.52359812000003%2C370.7868500499996%2C201.30368592000002%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C180.56147850000002%2C370.75284971000013%2C189.3415663%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C168.54235831000003%2C370.77084989000025%2C177.32244611000002%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C156.18323472000003%2C370.7358495400002%2C166.18333472000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22651%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security.

For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22666%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 666</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22667%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.81024098000003%2C318.5503782099999%2C370.7803506499997%2C327.3304660099999%5D%2C%5B59.81024098000003%2C306.1912546199999%2C370.71434998999996%2C316.19135461999986%5D%2C%5B59.80924097000002%2C294.5691383999999%2C370.8315057099997%2C304.148292%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C282.55155821%2C370.7805052000001%2C291.33164601%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C270.53243802%2C370.73752586999956%2C280.110492%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C258.57075878%2C370.7995264899994%2C267.35084658%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C246.55163859%2C370.7886274099999%2C256.129392%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22667%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22668%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.2305749999999%2C382.3291089299997%2C592.230675%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C570.55145821%2C382.3941095799996%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C558.19233462%2C382.3941095799999%2C568.1924346200001%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C546.230215%2C316.64445208999985%2C556.2303150000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22668%22%7D%7D\">participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways. First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.789%2C282.211775%2C370.76800975999987%2C292.21187499999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C270.53265820999997%2C370.73900946999964%2C279.31274600999996%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999999%2C258.23053518999996%2C370.73500942999976%2C268.23063518999993%5D%2C%5B59.81090021999995%2C246.21177500000002%2C370.7848947199999%2C256.211875%5D%2C%5B59.81078501000002%2C234.19265481000002%2C370.7683403699998%2C244.19275481000003%5D%2C%5B59.81023081999999%2C222.23075538%2C370.70233971%2C232.23085538%5D%2C%5B59.80923081000003%2C210.21177500000002%2C370.77674482%2C220.21187500000002%5D%2C%5B59.81063518999997%2C198.19265481000002%2C370.77172886999966%2C208.19275481000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSecond, a series of \u2018soft law\u2019 instruments have been produced, which endorse the taking of due diligence measures to prevent harmful cyber operations.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways. First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite early pronouncements that the internet would remain independent of the \u2018tyrannies\u2019 of elected government and sovereignty,70 it is now generally accepted that cyberspace is governed by international law.71 Were this not the case, cyber operations would occur in \u2018lacunae or \u201claw-free zones\u201d carrying the implication that lack of normative regulation may lead to any or unrestricted behaviour\u2019.72 The threat that an unregulated cyberspace could pose to the maintenance of international peace is clear. Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks.

For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22666%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 666</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22667%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.81024098000003%2C318.5503782099999%2C370.7803506499997%2C327.3304660099999%5D%2C%5B59.81024098000003%2C306.1912546199999%2C370.71434998999996%2C316.19135461999986%5D%2C%5B59.80924097000002%2C294.5691383999999%2C370.8315057099997%2C304.148292%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C282.55155821%2C370.7805052000001%2C291.33164601%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C270.53243802%2C370.73752586999956%2C280.110492%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C258.57075878%2C370.7995264899994%2C267.35084658%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C246.55163859%2C370.7886274099999%2C256.129392%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22667%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22668%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.2305749999999%2C382.3291089299997%2C592.230675%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C570.55145821%2C382.3941095799996%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C558.19233462%2C382.3941095799999%2C568.1924346200001%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C546.230215%2C316.64445208999985%2C556.2303150000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22668%22%7D%7D\">participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance.

First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B182.72857884999993%2C294.23031499999996%2C249.87025000000003%2C304.23041499999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 665</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22651%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.81074032000001%2C192.52359812000003%2C370.7868500499996%2C201.30368592000002%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C180.56147850000002%2C370.75284971000013%2C189.3415663%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C168.54235831000003%2C370.77084989000025%2C177.32244611000002%5D%2C%5B59.81074032000001%2C156.18323472000003%2C370.7358495400002%2C166.18333472000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22651%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security.

Foremost among these are the United Nations\u2019 GGE reports, discussed above.176 The 2013 GGE report prohibits the use, by States, of \u2018proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts\u2019 in cyberspace.177 It further requires States to \u2018ensure that their territories are not used by non-[s]tate actors\u2019 for unlawful cyber purposes.178 The 2015 GGE report acknowledges \u2018the challenges of attribution\u2019 in cyberspace.179 Relatedly, it provides that States must not \u2018conduct\u2019,180 \u2018support\u2019,181 or \u2018knowingly allow\u2019182 their territory to be used for unlawful cyber operations. Notwithstanding the uncertain future of the GGE, both these reports substantively affirm a responsibility of due diligence for States in cyberspace. The norms and principles set out in each report are non-binding.183 However, they are of weight as a codification effort achieved by government agents, in their official capacity, representing an \u2018equitable geographic distribution\u2019 of States.184 Furthermore, each report has been unanimously adopted and affirmed by the United Nations General Assembly.185 The sentiment of the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports is echoed by the works of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). For instance, in terms more prescriptive than those adopted by the GGE, the NATO Cyber Defense Policy recognizes the \u2018responsibility\u2019 of States to protect their national networks, and in doing so to facilitate the \u2018detection\u2019 and \u2018prevention\u2019 of international cyber security threats.186 Finally, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 cannot be altogether ignored as a reflection of the practice and opinio juris of States.187 It was drafted with the \u2018unofficial\u2019 assistance of over 50 States and international organizations, and the text was settled by the consensus of legal, academic, and technical experts.188 It was intended as a \u2018reflection of the law as it existed\u2019 at the time of drafting,189 and it extensively codifies a due diligence obligation.190\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 666)", "\u201cAn important rationale for adopting the due diligence principle as a standard of attribution is the contribution this would make to the maintenance of international peace and security.

As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 652)", "\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance. Importantly, all three were among the States who produced the 2013 and 2015 GGE reports. The United States has additionally ratified the Cybercrime Convention, and is bound by NATO\u2019s Cyber Defense Policy.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 668)", "\u201cState practice and opinio juris supporting a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace has arisen in three different ways. First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 665)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22647%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.78886640000006%2C294.22993537999986%2C370.7938764200003%2C304.23003537999983%5D%2C%5B59.81076662000007%2C282.21081518999983%2C370.7588760699998%2C292.2109151899998%5D%2C%5B59.81076662000007%2C270.1916949999998%2C370.76387612%2C280.1917949999998%5D%2C%5B59.809766610000054%2C258.5695787799998%2C370.7908763899994%2C267.3496665799998%5D%2C%5B59.809766610000054%2C246.5504585899998%2C370.8928774099995%2C255.3305463899998%5D%2C%5B59.809766610000054%2C234.5313383999998%2C370.7148756299993%2C243.3114261999998%5D%2C%5B59.809766610000054%2C222.5692187799998%2C370.75116671999996%2C232.148292%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22647%22%7D%7D\">\u201cState-based efforts to address this problem have been met with limited success.

Cyber operations have the capacity to harm the security, economy and infrastructure of States on an equivalent scale to kinetic attacks. The main State participants in cyberspace are some of the world\u2019s most influential powers, including the United States, China and Russia. As these States are each equipped with a nuclear arsenal, the potential threat to the global community that might follow from escalating cyber conflict is apparent.73 Furthermore, as noted earlier, the general accessibility of the cyber domain \u2018leaves the potential for mass destruction within the grasp of far less sophisticated [nonState] actors\u2019.74\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22652%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 652</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22667%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.81024098000003%2C318.5503782099999%2C370.7803506499997%2C327.3304660099999%5D%2C%5B59.81024098000003%2C306.1912546199999%2C370.71434998999996%2C316.19135461999986%5D%2C%5B59.80924097000002%2C294.5691383999999%2C370.8315057099997%2C304.148292%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C282.55155821%2C370.7805052000001%2C291.33164601%5D%2C%5B59.81039552999998%2C270.53243802%2C370.73752586999956%2C280.110492%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C258.57075878%2C370.7995264899994%2C267.35084658%5D%2C%5B59.81041662999999%2C246.55163859%2C370.7886274099999%2C256.129392%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22667%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile extensive and uniform practice is required to deduce the existence of new legal rules, the conduct of States \u2018whose interests are specially affected\u2019 is of notable weight.198 In this regard, despite the accessibility of the domain, there are relatively few parties actively engaging in hostile cyber operations.199 Nearly all publicly known cyber operations that have occurred since the Estonia attacks in 2007 have involved, either as the alleged perpetrator or victim, the United States, Russia or China.200 As such, the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22668%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.2305749999999%2C382.3291089299997%2C592.230675%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C570.55145821%2C382.3941095799996%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C558.19233462%2C382.3941095799999%2C568.1924346200001%5D%2C%5B71.43299999999999%2C546.230215%2C316.64445208999985%2C556.2303150000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22668%22%7D%7D\">participation of these States in norm building efforts is of particular importance.

First, and most notably, a large number of States have assumed international obligations in the cyber context pursuant to the Convention on Cybercrime (Cybercrime Convention).167 While treaties are a source of law in their own right,168 they can also be a powerful expression by ratifying States of the legal obligations applicable in a particular field.169 The Cybercrime Convention creates an obligation on States to domestically criminalize data interference and system interference,170 and to enforce sanctions for non-compliance.171 A duty to domestically criminalize nefarious cyber operations necessarily complements a more general duty of diligence.172 As the ICJ observed in Pulp Mills, a due diligence obligation \u2018entails not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a certain level of vigilance in their enforcement\u2019.173 The Cybercrime Convention has been ratified by 55 States and signed, without ratification, by a further four States.174 The Convention\u2019s obligations have also been echoed by the United Nations General Assembly, which has called on States to \u2018ensure their laws ... eliminate safe havens for those who criminally misuse information technologies\u2019.175</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22665%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B182.72857884999993%2C294.23031499999996%2C249.87025000000003%2C304.23041499999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%7D\">\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22665%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 665</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "L Chircop", "date": "2018", "journal": "International & Comparative Law Quarterly", "title": "A DUE DILIGENCE STANDARD OF ATTRIBUTION IN CYBERSPACE", "abstract": "The technical and legal challenges of attribution in cyberspace prevent the meaningful operation of the international law framework of State responsibility.

If this is the case, a due diligence standard of attribution in cyberspace would not be antithetical to the Articles on State Responsibility. On the contrary, it would be entirely consistent with its text and historical treatment by international courts.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 662)", "\u201cIn the Armed Activities case, the ICJ again took the opportunity to consider novel submissions concerning attribution. In this instance, the Court seemed to endorse a \u2018toleration\u2019 or \u2018acquiescence\u2019 standard for attributing uses of force to States. Specifically, it observed that two paragraphs of the Friendly Relations Declaration, which prohibited \u2018tolerat[ing]\u2019 or \u2018acquiescing in\u2019 acts constituting the use of force or civil strife, were \u2018declaratory of customary international law\u2019.140 This standard was then employed by the Court when assessing whether Congolese authorities had committed a use of force in supporting anti-Ugandan insurgents.141 The ICJ concluded that, on the available evidence, it could not consider the Congo to have tolerated or acquiesced in the insurgent\u2019s activities.142 In the alternative, it observed that Uganda had carried out an illegal use of force against the Congo on 7 August 1998, and any subsequent military action by Congolese authorities was justified as action taken in self-defence.143 In either case, the ICJ seems to have prima facie accepted the operation of a toleration or acquiescence standard for attributing uses of force.144\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 662)", "\u201cDue diligence reflects a general principle of international law best articulated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Corfu Channel judgment: \u2018it is every State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u2019.52 Since Corfu Channel, due diligence has been particularized in various specialized regimes of international law.53 This does not, however, preclude application of the principle in new or novel contexts. On the contrary, as due diligence is a general principle, \u2018the presumption is that it applies unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it\u2019.54 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 contains a detailed and helpful analysis of how due diligence should be applied in cyberspace.55 It is worthwhile briefly mapping out the principle\u2019s content, given that a natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for States. As the following analysis will demonstrate, a State will only breach its obligation of due diligence in narrowly defined circumstances. In a sense, each element of the principle acts as a reasonable limitation on potential State responsibility. Specifically, a State will only fail to exercise due diligence when it has (1) knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, which is (2) contrary to the rights of another State, and it (3) fails to take feasible measures to prevent it.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 650)", "\u201cWhile Corfu Channel preceded the completion of the Articles on State Responsibility, it nonetheless provided the seminal articulation of the due diligence principle as a primary rule of international law.133 The dispute concerned Albania\u2019s responsibility for damage caused to two British warships by mine explosions in Albanian territorial waters.134 Although Albania was not responsible for laying the mines,135 its failure to warn incoming warships of imminent danger constituted a due diligence violation.136 Submissions during the course of proceedings directed the ICJ to consider alternative attribution standards. In particular, the United Kingdom invoked the notions of \u2018complicity\u2019 and \u2018connivance\u2019 in attempting to impute Albania with responsibility for the creation of the minefield.137 Complicity and connivance were formulated to more closely resemble a standard of attribution than a primary rule.138 This submission was ultimately disregarded by the Court because of evidential uncertainty,139 but the ICJ did not reject the formulation as a matter of principle.\u201d (Chircop, 2018, p. 661)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22660%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.43320754000001%2C306.5327180299999%2C382.34931666999995%2C315.3128058299999%5D%2C%5B71.43320754000001%2C294.5705984099999%2C382.40931726999963%2C303.3506862099999%5D%2C%5B71.43320754000001%2C282.21147481999986%2C382.3487399799995%2C292.21157481999984%5D%2C%5B71.43263084999998%2C270.19265480999996%2C382.38821163%2C280.19275480999994%5D%2C%5B71.43210210000001%2C258.23075538%2C382.34121115999955%2C268.23085538%5D%2C%5B71.4321021%2C246.55163859%2C382.3722114699996%2C255.33172639%5D%2C%5B71.4321021%2C234.53251840000001%2C342.6598143499999%2C243.3126062%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22660%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, international courts have repeatedly engaged with novel arguments concerning the State responsibility framework.

Specifically, it observed that two paragraphs of the Friendly Relations Declaration, which prohibited \u2018tolerat[ing]\u2019 or \u2018acquiescing in\u2019 acts constituting the use of force or civil strife, were \u2018declaratory of customary international law\u2019.140 This standard was then employed by the Court when assessing whether Congolese authorities had committed a use of force in supporting anti-Ugandan insurgents.141 The ICJ concluded that, on the available evidence, it could not consider the Congo to have tolerated or acquiesced in the insurgent\u2019s activities.142 In the alternative, it observed that Uganda had carried out an illegal use of force against the Congo on 7 August 1998, and any subsequent military action by Congolese authorities was justified</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22662%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.5705783999999%2C382.3720288999997%2C592.091492%5D%2C%5B71.43291954%2C570.55145821%2C382.34202859999976%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43291954%2C558.53233802%2C180.02465000000004%2C568.110392%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22662%22%7D%7D\">as action taken in self-defence.143 In either case, the ICJ seems to have prima facie accepted the operation of a toleration or acquiescence standard for attributing uses of force.144\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22662%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 662</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22649%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B59.811%2C306.192875%2C370.7491093499995%2C316.192975%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999999%2C294.23075538%2C370.7681095399999%2C304.23085538%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999998%2C282.21163519%2C370.7681095399996%2C292.21173518999996%5D%2C%5B59.81099999999998%2C270.19251499999996%2C370.77652595999996%2C280.19261499999993%5D%2C%5B59.81041633000001%2C258.57075878%2C370.7115253099999%2C267.35084658%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22649%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDue diligence reflects a general principle of international law best articulated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its Corfu Channel judgment: \u2018it is every State\u2019s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u2019.52 Since Corfu Channel, due diligence has been particularized in various specialized regimes of</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22650%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.433%2C582.5705783999999%2C382.44414779%2C592.091492%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C570.55145821%2C382.3681470299999%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C558.19233462%2C382.4331476799995%2C568.1924346200001%5D%2C%5B71.43303771000001%2C546.230215%2C382.3966791599999%2C556.2303150000001%5D%2C%5B71.43256954999998%2C534.55145821%2C382.36755450999993%2C544.1292920000001%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C522.1925548099999%2C382.2995538299994%2C532.19265481%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C510.57043859000004%2C382.4095549299995%2C519.35052639%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C498.5513184%2C382.3095539299995%2C507.3314062%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C486.53219821%2C382.4055548899998%2C495.31228601%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C474.23007519%2C382.3875547099997%2C484.23017518999995%5D%2C%5B71.43244519000004%2C462.21095499999996%2C382.3265540999999%2C472.21105499999993%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C450.53183820999993%2C382.3405542399995%2C459.3119260099999%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C438.5697185899999%2C382.4065548999997%2C447.3498063899999%5D%2C%5B71.43144518000003%2C426.5505983999999%2C382.37055453999966%2C435.3306861999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22650%22%7D%7D\">international law.53 This does not, however, preclude application of the principle in new or novel contexts. On the contrary, as due diligence is a general principle, \u2018the presumption is that it applies unless State practice or opinio juris excludes it\u2019.54 The Tallinn Manual 2.0 contains a detailed and helpful analysis of how due diligence should be applied in cyberspace.55 It is worthwhile briefly mapping out the principle\u2019s content, given that a natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for States. As the following analysis will demonstrate, a State will only breach its obligation of due diligence in narrowly defined circumstances. In a sense, each element of the principle acts as a reasonable limitation on potential State responsibility. Specifically, a State will only fail to exercise due diligence when it has (1) knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, which is (2) contrary to the rights of another State, and it (3) fails to take feasible measures to prevent it.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22650%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Chircop, 2018, p. 650</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FECG8EK5H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22661%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B69.789%2C582.5705783999999%2C370.7200092799999%2C591.3506662%5D%2C%5B59.80990021000002%2C570.55145821%2C370.7780098599998%2C579.33154601%5D%2C%5B59.80990021000002%2C558.53233802%2C370.77919499999985%2C568.110392%5D%2C%5B59.81008534%2C546.23065538%2C370.7291945%2C556.2307553800001%5D%2C%5B59.81108535000001%2C534.5515385900001%2C370.71668665999977%2C544.1292920000001%5D%2C%5B59.80957761999997%2C522.5325582099999%2C370.80318096999986%2C532.110392%5D%2C%5B59.81007106999999%2C510.5706587800001%2C370.7741806799998%2C519.3507465800001%5D%2C%5B59.81007106999999%2C498.55153859000006%2C370.7302751199997%2C508.129292%5D%2C%5B59.811165960000004%2C486.53255821%2C370.81727598999953%2C495.31264601%5D%2C%5B59.81116596000001%2C474.23043519%2C370.7842756599999%2C484.23053518999996%5D%2C%5B59.81116596000004%2C462.21131499999996%2C370.7800456800001%2C472.21141499999993%5D%2C%5B59.811%2C450.5327784%2C370.85411040000014%2C459.3128662%5D%2C%5B59.811%2C438.5705784%2C370.6920623099997%2C448.148292%5D%2C%5B59.80995351999999%2C426.55145820999996%2C370.77409982999984%2C436.129392%5D%2C%5B59.80999022000003%2C414.53255821%2C258.27097481%2C423.31264601%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY92SMUUI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22661%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile Corfu Channel preceded the completion of the Articles on State Responsibility, it nonetheless provided the seminal articulation of the due diligence principle as a primary rule of international law.133 The dispute concerned Albania\u2019s responsibility for damage caused to two British warships by mine explosions in Albanian territorial waters.134 Although Albania was not responsible for laying the mines,135 its failure to warn incoming warships of imminent danger constituted a due diligence violation.136 Submissions during the course of proceedings directed the ICJ to consider alternative attribution standards.
