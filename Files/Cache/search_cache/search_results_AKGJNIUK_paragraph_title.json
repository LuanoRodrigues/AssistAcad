An example of such an act is the conduct of a cyber operation against a coastal state from a ship sailing in its territorial waters, which constitutes a violation of the innocent passage regime. Failure to respect the principle of due diligence may also constitute a breach of an international obligation, which will be discussed below.38 However, the principle of sovereignty is the most susceptible to violation, as it applies to all cyber infrastructure located within the territory of a state, and therefore any cyber operation against that infrastructure may also constitute a violation of an international obligation.39\u201d (Sp\u00e1\u010dil, 2023, p. 92)", "\u201cAs the perpetrators of cyber operations often actively try to hide their identity (spoofing), or conduct operations from or through the territory of third states, injured states are at risk of misattribution.23 An example is the cyber operation carried out by North Korea against servers in South Korea in 2013, which used computers in forty countries.24 It is clear that most, if not all, of these countries had nothing to do with this cyber operation. If an injured state misidentifies a responsible state and takes countermeasures against an innocent third state based on that misattribution, it may itself be committing an internationally wrongful act. The scholarly debate then turns to the question of whether this wrongfulness is affected by conduct in good faith. According to one group of scholars, acting in good faith makes countermeasures legal even against a third state.25 Most authors, however, hold that good faith does not liberate the injured state of its legal responsibility.26 The latter view is then the official position of both the International Law Commission and the Tallinn Manual 2.0.27 The risk of misattribution is one of the reasons why countermeasures should be approached with caution, which is also emphasized in official opinions by some States, such as Brazil or the United States.28\u201d (Sp\u00e1\u010dil, 2023, p. 90)"],

types of obligations constitutes an internationally wrongful act. An example of such an act is the conduct of a cyber operation against a coastal state from a ship sailing in its territorial waters, which constitutes a violation of the innocent passage regime. Failure to respect the principle of due diligence may also constitute a breach of an international obligation, which will be discussed below.38 However, the principle of sovereignty is the most susceptible to violation, as it applies to all cyber infrastructure located within the territory of a state, and therefore any cyber operation against that infrastructure may also constitute a violation of an international obligation.39\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2292%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Sp\u00e1\u010dil, 2023, p. 92</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FTMFZ2PVL%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2289%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B70.8661%2C193.886%2C374.1733%2C203.99599999999998%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C181.886%2C374.1728999999999%2C191.99599999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2289%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs the perpetrators of cyber operations often actively try to hide their identity (spoofing), or conduct operations from or through the territory of third states,</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FTMFZ2PVL%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B56.6929%2C581.571%2C374.1964000000001%2C592.29633%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C569.571%2C374.1719000000001%2C579.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C557.571%2C374.1733%2C568.29633%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C545.571%2C374.1733%2C555.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C533.571%2C375.2819%2C543.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C521.571%2C374.21290000000033%2C531.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C509.571%2C374.1399000000001%2C519.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C497.57099999999997%2C374.2099000000002%2C507.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C485.57099999999997%2C374.4829%2C495.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C473.57099999999997%2C374.18539999999996%2C484.29632999999995%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C461.57099999999997%2C374.1613000000002%2C472.29632999999995%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C449.57099999999997%2C374.1735999999999%2C460.29632999999995%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C437.57099999999997%2C374.1908999999998%2C447.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C425.57099999999997%2C374.1778999999999%2C435.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C413.57099999999997%2C227.08679999999998%2C424.29632999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%7D\">injured states are at risk of misattribution.23 An example is the cyber operation carried out by North Korea against servers in South Korea in 2013, which used computers in forty countries.24 It is clear that most, if not all, of these countries had nothing to do with this cyber operation. If an injured state misidentifies a responsible state and takes countermeasures against an innocent third state based on that misattribution, it may itself be committing an internationally wrongful act. The scholarly debate then turns to the question of whether this wrongfulness is affected by conduct in good faith. According to one group of scholars, acting in good faith makes countermeasures legal even against a third state.25 Most authors, however, hold that good faith does not liberate the injured state of its legal responsibility.26 The latter view is then the official position of both the International Law Commission and the Tallinn Manual 2.0.27 The risk of misattribution is one of the reasons why countermeasures should be approached with caution, which is also emphasized in official opinions by some States, such as Brazil or the United States.28\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Sp\u00e1\u010dil, 2023, p. 90</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Jakub Sp\u00e1\u010dil", "date": "2023", "journal": "International and Comparative Law Review", "title": "Countermeasures against Cyber Operations: Moving forward?", "abstract": "The paper is devoted to the analysis of countermeasures in the context of cyber operations.

The ILC refers to those human rights \u201cwhich may not be derogated from in time of war or other public emergency\u201d.49 Typically, these include the right to life, health or the prohibition of torture and slavery.50 Also norms of humanitarian law, captured in particular by the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, cannot be breach by countermeasures.51 These humanitarian rules are directly reflected in the crimes defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.52 In view of these rules, a cyber operation aimed at interrupting the supply of water and electricity to a medi</span><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FTMFZ2PVL%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2294%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B56.6929%2C581.571%2C375.26379999999995%2C592.29633%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C569.571%2C374.2109000000001%2C579.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C557.571%2C374.17530000000016%2C568.29633%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C545.571%2C374.2099000000003%2C555.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C533.571%2C374.8249000000002%2C543.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C521.571%2C374.1499%2C531.681%5D%2C%5B56.6929%2C509.571%2C128.90879999999999%2C520.29633%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2294%22%7D%7D\">cal facility, for example, would be inadmissible.53 A right which, on the other hand, cannot be subsumed under \u201cfundamental\u201d rights is the right to free and democratic elections.54 At the same time, however, the above prohibition on violating fundamental human rights does not mean that countermeasures taken cannot have a negative impact on these rights, since such a strict interpretation of the prohibition on interference with these rights would preclude almost any countermeasure.55\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FAKGJNIUK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2294%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Sp\u00e1\u010dil, 2023, p. 94</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Jakub Sp\u00e1\u010dil", "date": "2023", "journal": "International and Comparative Law Review", "title": "Countermeasures against Cyber Operations: Moving forward?", "abstract": "The paper is devoted to the analysis of countermeasures in the context of cyber operations.
