As self-defense is an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, in particular, the standard of proof should be high enough to limit its invocation to exceptional circumstances and, thus, avoid abuses.107(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)", "In spite of the obvious crucial importance of evidentiary issues, works on inter-state cyber operations, both above and below the level of the use of force, have so far focused on whether such operations are consistent with primary norms of international law and on the remedies available to the victim state under the jus ad bellum and the law of state responsibility, and have almost entirely neglected a discussion of the evidence the victim state needs to produce to demonstrate, either before a judicial body or elsewhere, that an unlawful cyber operation has been conducted against it and that it is attributable to another state.30 The first edition of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare also does not discuss in depth evidentiary issues in the cyber context: the only references to evidence are contained in Rules 7 and 8.31 The present chapter aims to fill this gap. It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations.

Indeed, \u201cevidentiary thresholds that might have worked well in a world of conventional threats\u2014where capabilities could be judged with high accuracy and the costs of false negatives to peace and security were not necessarily devastating\u2014risk exposing states to unacceptable dangers.\u201d109 There is of course no case-law in relation to claims arising out of inter-state cyber operations, so possible indications in this sense have to be found elsewhere. The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that \u201chigh-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.\u201d111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that \u201csome level of mitigating action\u201d can be taken against cyber attacks \u201ceven when we are not certain who is responsible.\u201d112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: \u201cInternational law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.\u201d113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that \u201cfrom both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.\u201d114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)", "In spite of the obvious crucial importance of evidentiary issues, works on inter-state cyber operations, both above and below the level of the use of force, have so far focused on whether such operations are consistent with primary norms of international law and on the remedies available to the victim state under the jus ad bellum and the law of state responsibility, and have almost entirely neglected a discussion of the evidence the victim state needs to produce to demonstrate, either before a judicial body or elsewhere, that an unlawful cyber operation has been conducted against it and that it is attributable to another state.30 The first edition of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare also does not discuss in depth evidentiary issues in the cyber context: the only references to evidence are contained in Rules 7 and 8.31 The present chapter aims to fill this gap. It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations. It will then analyze the standard of proof required in the cyber context. Finally, the possible methods of proof will be examined, distinguishing between those which are admissible and those which are inadmissible. The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts. It also does not look at evidence before international criminal tribunals, as the focus is on state responsibility for cyber operations and not on the criminal responsibility of individuals.31(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)", "The US Department of Defense\u2019s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations confirms that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026public statements by officials.\u201d189 There do not seem to be, however, any official statements by Russian or Chinese authorities directly or even indirectly acknowledging responsibility for the cyber operations against Estonia, Georgia, and the United States: on the contrary, involvement was denied. With regard to Stuxnet, when asked questions about the incident, US and Israeli authorities neither admitted nor denied attribution.

It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations. It will then analyze the standard of proof required in the cyber context. Finally, the possible methods of proof will be examined, distinguishing between those which are admissible and those which are inadmissible. The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts. It also does not look at evidence before international criminal tribunals, as the focus is on state responsibility for cyber operations and not on the criminal responsibility of individuals.31(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)", "If clear and convincing evidence is required at least in relation to claims related to the use of armed force, the question arises whether there is a special, and lower, standard in the cyber context, in particular for claims of self-defense against cyber operations. Indeed, \u201cevidentiary thresholds that might have worked well in a world of conventional threats\u2014where capabilities could be judged with high accuracy and the costs of false negatives to peace and security were not necessarily devastating\u2014risk exposing states to unacceptable dangers.\u201d109 There is of course no case-law in relation to claims arising out of inter-state cyber operations, so possible indications in this sense have to be found elsewhere. The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that \u201chigh-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.\u201d111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that \u201csome level of mitigating action\u201d can be taken against cyber attacks \u201ceven when we are not certain who is responsible.\u201d112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: \u201cInternational law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.\u201d113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that \u201cfrom both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.\u201d114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)", "The US Department of Defense\u2019s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations confirms that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026public statements by officials.\u201d189 There do not seem to be, however, any official statements by Russian or Chinese authorities directly or even indirectly acknowledging responsibility for the cyber operations against Estonia, Georgia, and the United States: on the contrary, involvement was denied. With regard to Stuxnet, when asked questions about the incident, US and Israeli authorities neither admitted nor denied attribution.

It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations. It will then analyze the standard of proof required in the cyber context. Finally, the possible methods of proof will be examined, distinguishing between those which are admissible and those which are inadmissible. The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts. It also does not look at evidence before international criminal tribunals, as the focus is on state responsibility for cyber operations and not on the criminal responsibility of individuals.31(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)", "If clear and convincing evidence is required at least in relation to claims related to the use of armed force, the question arises whether there is a special, and lower, standard in the cyber context, in particular for claims of self-defense against cyber operations. Indeed, \u201cevidentiary thresholds that might have worked well in a world of conventional threats\u2014where capabilities could be judged with high accuracy and the costs of false negatives to peace and security were not necessarily devastating\u2014risk exposing states to unacceptable dangers.\u201d109 There is of course no case-law in relation to claims arising out of inter-state cyber operations, so possible indications in this sense have to be found elsewhere. The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that \u201chigh-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.\u201d111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that \u201csome level of mitigating action\u201d can be taken against cyber attacks \u201ceven when we are not certain who is responsible.\u201d112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: \u201cInternational law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.\u201d113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that \u201cfrom both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.\u201d114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)", "The ICJ, however, \u201chas demonstrated an increasing resistance to the drawing of inferences from secondary evidence.\u201d224 Only inferences to protect state sovereignty are normally drawn by the Court, while others are treated with great caution.225 Examples of situations where the ICJ has explored the possibility of drawing inferences include exclusive control of territory and non-production of documents.226 As to the first, it has been argued that the state from which the cyber operation originates has presumptive knowledge of such operation. US officials have claimed, for instance, that, from the control that the Iranian government exercises over the internet, it is \u201chard to imagine\u201d that cyber attacks originating from Iran against US oil, gas, and electricity companies could be conducted without governmental knowledge, even in the absence of direct proof of state involvement.227 The same considerations may be extended to cyber operations originating from China and other states where access to the internet is under strict governmental control. The US Department of Defense\u2019s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations also claims that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026the location of the offending computer within a state-controlled facility.\u201d228 In the literature, Garnett and Clarke have claimed that \u201cin a situation where there have been repeated instances of hostile computer activity emanating from a State\u2019s territory directed against another State, it seems reasonable to presume that the host State had knowledge of such attacks and so should incur responsibility.\u201d229 At least certain of the cyber attacks against Estonia and Georgia originated from Russian IP addresses, including those of state institutions.230 The Mandiant Report also traced the cyber intrusions into US computers back to Chinese IP addresses.231 As has been seen, however, in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ held that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised [by a state] over its territory\u2026that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.\u201d232 Only if there are other indications of state involvement may territorial control contribute to establish knowledge.233 In Oil Platforms, the ICJ also refused to accept the US argument that the territorial control exercised by Iran over the area from which the missile against the Sea Isle City had been fired was sufficient to demonstrate Iran\u2019s responsibility.234 These conclusions are transposed in the cyber context by Rules 7 and 8 of the Tallinn Manual, according to which neither the fact that a cyber operation originates from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure nor that it has been routed through the cyber infrastructure located in a state are sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to those states, although it may be \u201can indication that the State in question is associated with the operation.\u201d234 The Manual does not clarify what probative value this \u201cindication\u201d would have.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 17)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p>The US Department of Defense\u2019s <em>Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations</em> confirms that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026public statements by officials.\u201d<sup><a href=\"javascript:;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">189</a></sup> There do not seem to be, however, any official statements by Russian or Chinese authorities directly or even indirectly acknowledging responsibility for the cyber operations against Estonia, Georgia, and the United States: on the contrary, involvement was denied.

The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts.

The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that \u201chigh-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.\u201d111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that \u201csome level of mitigating action\u201d can be taken against cyber attacks \u201ceven when we are not certain who is responsible.\u201d112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: \u201cInternational law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.\u201d113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that \u201cfrom both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.\u201d114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p>Digital evidence, however, is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role to establish state responsibility for cyber operations, for several reasons.

US officials have claimed, for instance, that, from the control that the Iranian government exercises over the internet, it is \u201chard to imagine\u201d that cyber attacks originating from Iran against US oil, gas, and electricity companies could be conducted without governmental knowledge, even in the absence of direct proof of state involvement.227 The same considerations may be extended to cyber operations originating from China and other states where access to the internet is under strict governmental control. The US Department of Defense\u2019s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations also claims that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026the location of the offending computer within a state-controlled facility.\u201d228 In the literature, Garnett and Clarke have claimed that \u201cin a situation where there have been repeated instances of hostile computer activity emanating from a State\u2019s territory directed against another State, it seems reasonable to presume that the host State had knowledge of such attacks and so should incur responsibility.\u201d229 At least certain of the cyber attacks against Estonia and Georgia originated from Russian IP addresses, including those of state institutions.230 The Mandiant Report also traced the cyber intrusions into US computers back to Chinese IP addresses.231 As has been seen, however, in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ held that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised [by a state] over its territory\u2026that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.\u201d232 Only if there are other indications of state involvement may territorial control contribute to establish knowledge.233 In Oil Platforms, the ICJ also refused to accept the US argument that the territorial control exercised by Iran over the area from which the missile against the Sea Isle City had been fired was sufficient to demonstrate Iran\u2019s responsibility.234 These conclusions are transposed in the cyber context by Rules 7 and 8 of the Tallinn Manual, according to which neither the fact that a cyber operation originates from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure nor that it has been routed through the cyber infrastructure located in a state are sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to those states, although it may be \u201can indication that the State in question is associated with the operation.\u201d234 The Manual does not clarify what probative value this \u201cindication\u201d would have.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 17)", "If clear and convincing evidence is required at least in relation to claims related to the use of armed force, the question arises whether there is a special, and lower, standard in the cyber context, in particular for claims of self-defense against cyber operations. Indeed, \u201cevidentiary thresholds that might have worked well in a world of conventional threats\u2014where capabilities could be judged with high accuracy and the costs of false negatives to peace and security were not necessarily devastating\u2014risk exposing states to unacceptable dangers.\u201d109 There is of course no case-law in relation to claims arising out of inter-state cyber operations, so possible indications in this sense have to be found elsewhere. The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that \u201chigh-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.\u201d111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that \u201csome level of mitigating action\u201d can be taken against cyber attacks \u201ceven when we are not certain who is responsible.\u201d112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: \u201cInternational law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.\u201d113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that \u201cfrom both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.\u201d114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)", "\u201cEvidence\u201d is \u201cinformation\u2026with a view of establishing or disproving alleged facts.\u201d33 It is different from \u201cproof\u201d in that \u201c\u2018proof\u2019 is the result or effect of evidence, while \u2018evidence\u2019 is the \u201cmedium or means by which a fact is proved or disproved.\u201d34 Evidence is normally required to provide proof of both the objective (be it an act or omission) and subjective elements of an internationally wrongful act, that is, its attribution to a state. A state invoking self-defense against cyber attacks, for instance, will have to produce evidence that demonstrates: (1) that the cyber attack actually occurred, that it was directed against it, and that its scale and effects reached the threshold of an \u201carmed attack\u201d35 and (2) that it was attributable to a certain state.36 For a state to invoke the right to take countermeasures, on the other hand, it may be sufficient to provide evidence that a cyber operation originated from a certain state and that that state did not exercise due diligence in terminating it, without necessarily having to prove attribution of the attack itself to the state.36 In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ clearly explained the distinction between the objective and subjective elements from an evidentiary perspective [o]ne of the Court\u2019s chief di culties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute...Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are con icting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it...The occurrence of the act itself may however have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour rst to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.37 The Court\u2019s observations\u201d (Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p>In spite of the obvious crucial importance of evidentiary issues, works on inter-state cyber operations, both above and below the level of the use of force, have so far focused on whether such operations are consistent with primary norms of international law and on the remedies available to the victim state under the jus ad bellum and the law of state responsibility, and have almost entirely neglected a discussion of the evidence the victim state needs to produce to demonstrate, either before a judicial body or elsewhere, that an unlawful cyber operation has been conducted against it and that it is attributable to another state.<sup><a href=\"javascript:;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">30</a></sup> The first edition of the <em>Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare</em> also does not discuss in depth evidentiary issues in the cyber context: the only references to evidence are contained in Rules 7 and 8.<sup><a href=\"Tallinn Manual(n2) 34\u20136.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" title=\"Tallinn Manual(n2) 34\u20136.\">31</a></sup> The present chapter aims to fill this gap.

In this case, the Report concluded \u201cwith high confidence that the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their action.\u201d170 Information security companies like Symantec, McAfee, and Mandiant also regularly compile detailed technical reports on cyber threats and specific incidents.171 In general, however, reports from NGOs and other non-governmental bodies have been considered by the ICJ as having less probative value than publications of states and international organizations, and have been used in a corroborative role only.172 In DRC v Uganda, for instance, the ICJ considered a report by International Crisis Group not to constitute \u201creliable evidence.\u201d173 Similarly, in Oil Platforms the Court did not find publications such as Lloyd\u2019s Maritime Information Service, the General Council of British Shipping and Jane\u2019s Intelligence Review to be authoritative public sources, as it had no \u201cindication of what was the original source, or sources, or evidence on which the public sources relied.\u201d174 This \u201cunequal treatment\u201d of documents of international organizations and NGOs has been criticized: \u201cthe correct approach is for the Court to apply its general evaluative criteria to documents produced by NGOs just as it does to those generated by UN actors.\u201d174(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 13)", "The ICJ, however, \u201chas demonstrated an increasing resistance to the drawing of inferences from secondary evidence.\u201d224 Only inferences to protect state sovereignty are normally drawn by the Court, while others are treated with great caution.225 Examples of situations where the ICJ has explored the possibility of drawing inferences include exclusive control of territory and non-production of documents.226 As to the first, it has been argued that the state from which the cyber operation originates has presumptive knowledge of such operation. US officials have claimed, for instance, that, from the control that the Iranian government exercises over the internet, it is \u201chard to imagine\u201d that cyber attacks originating from Iran against US oil, gas, and electricity companies could be conducted without governmental knowledge, even in the absence of direct proof of state involvement.227 The same considerations may be extended to cyber operations originating from China and other states where access to the internet is under strict governmental control. The US Department of Defense\u2019s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations also claims that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026the location of the offending computer within a state-controlled facility.\u201d228 In the literature, Garnett and Clarke have claimed that \u201cin a situation where there have been repeated instances of hostile computer activity emanating from a State\u2019s territory directed against another State, it seems reasonable to presume that the host State had knowledge of such attacks and so should incur responsibility.\u201d229 At least certain of the cyber attacks against Estonia and Georgia originated from Russian IP addresses, including those of state institutions.230 The Mandiant Report also traced the cyber intrusions into US computers back to Chinese IP addresses.231 As has been seen, however, in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ held that \u201cit cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised [by a state] over its territory\u2026that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.\u201d232 Only if there are other indications of state involvement may territorial control contribute to establish knowledge.233 In Oil Platforms, the ICJ also refused to accept the US argument that the territorial control exercised by Iran over the area from which the missile against the Sea Isle City had been fired was sufficient to demonstrate Iran\u2019s responsibility.234 These conclusions are transposed in the cyber context by Rules 7 and 8 of the Tallinn Manual, according to which neither the fact that a cyber operation originates from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure nor that it has been routed through the cyber infrastructure located in a state are sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to those states, although it may be \u201can indication that the State in question is associated with the operation.\u201d234 The Manual does not clarify what probative value this \u201cindication\u201d would have.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 17)", "In spite of the obvious crucial importance of evidentiary issues, works on inter-state cyber operations, both above and below the level of the use of force, have so far focused on whether such operations are consistent with primary norms of international law and on the remedies available to the victim state under the jus ad bellum and the law of state responsibility, and have almost entirely neglected a discussion of the evidence the victim state needs to produce to demonstrate, either before a judicial body or elsewhere, that an unlawful cyber operation has been conducted against it and that it is attributable to another state.30 The first edition of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare also does not discuss in depth evidentiary issues in the cyber context: the only references to evidence are contained in Rules 7 and 8.31 The present chapter aims to fill this gap. It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations. It will then analyze the standard of proof required in the cyber context. Finally, the possible methods of proof will be examined, distinguishing between those which are admissible and those which are inadmissible. The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts. It also does not look at evidence before international criminal tribunals, as the focus is on state responsibility for cyber operations and not on the criminal responsibility of individuals.31(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p>The US Department of Defense\u2019s <em>Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations</em> confirms that \u201c[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as\u2026public statements by officials.\u201d<sup><a href=\"javascript:;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">189</a></sup> There do not seem to be, however, any official statements by Russian or Chinese authorities directly or even indirectly acknowledging responsibility for the cyber operations against Estonia, Georgia, and the United States: on the contrary, involvement was denied.

In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour rst to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.37 The Court\u2019s observations\u201d (Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)", "There are no express rules on the admissibility of evidence in the ICJ Statute. Therefore, \u201c[t]he general practice of the Court has been to admit contested documents and testimony, subject to the reservation that the Court will itself be the judge of the weight to be accorded to it.\u201d250 Evidence may, however, be declared inadmissible because it has been produced too late or not in the prescribed form.251 Another example of inadmissible evidence is provided by the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the Factory at Ch\u00f3rzow case, where the ICJ\u2019s predecessor held that it \u201ccannot take account of declarations, admissions or proposals which the parties may have made in the course of direct negotiations when the negotiations in questions have not led to an agreement between the parties.\u201d252 The underlying reason for the inadmissibility of such material is to facilitate the diplomatic settlement of international disputes through negotiations, so that the negotiating parties do not have to fear that what they say in the negotiating context may be used against them in subsequent judicial proceedings.252(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 18)", "Evidence may be submitted not only to an international court or tribunal, but also to political organs (for instance to secure a favorable vote), or could be disseminated more widely for the purposes of influencing public opinion and gain support for certain actions or inactions.46 One could recall the evidence presented by the Reagan Administration before the UN Security Council to justify its 1986 strike on Tripoli as a measure of self-defense.47 When substantiating its 2001 armed operation against Afghanistan, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations referred to the fact that the US government had \u201cclear and compelling information that the Al-Qaeda organization, which is supported by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, had a central role in the [September 11, 2001] attacks,\u201d without however going into further details.48 The same language was used by the Secretary-General of NATO.49 Evidence was also famously one of the controversial aspects of the 2003 US\u2013UK intervention against Iraq.50 More recently, in the context of the proposed intervention to react against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, President Obama stated that attacking another country without a UN mandate and without \u201cclear evidence that can be presented\u201d would raise questions of international law.50 The political or judicial relevance of evidence may relate to the different phases of the same international dispute. For instance, the state invoking the right of self-defense against an armed attack by another state will normally try to justify the exercise of this right first before the international community and public opinion by providing evidence of the occurrence (or imminent occurrence) of the armed attack and of its attribution to the target state. If, as in the case of the Military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, a state subsequently brings the case before an international court, which has jurisdiction over the case, the evidence will have to be assessed by that court in order to establish international responsibility and its consequences, and in particular whether the requirements for the exercise of self-defense were met.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 5)", "This leads us to an important specification: the standard of proof must be distinguished from the rules of attribution. The former is \u201cthe quantum of evidence necessary to substantiate the factual claims made by the parties.\u201d41 The latter, on the other hand, determine the level of connection that must exist between an individual or group of individuals and a state for the conduct of the individuals to be attributed to the state at the international level. The rules of attribution for the purposes of state responsibility have been codified in the Part One of the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC), as well as having been articulated in the case-law of the ICJ.42 Evidence according to the applicable standard must be provided to demonstrate that the attribution test has been satisfied: in Nicaragua, for instance, the ICJ had to assess whether there was sufficient evidence that the United States had exercised \u201ceffective control\u201d over the contras so that it could be held responsible for their violations of international humanitarian law.42(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p>It is difficult, however, to see why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach it. The standard of proof exists not to disadvantage the claimant, but to protect the respondent against false attribution, which, thanks to tricks like IP spoofing, onion routing and the use of botnets, is a particularly serious risk in the cyber context.
