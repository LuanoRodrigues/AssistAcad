Enabled by post-9/11 changes to the structure of the intelligence community, these interagency and public-private collaborations \u2013 in Carlin\u2019s own words \u2013 were motivated by the early cyber proxy landscape.17\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)", "\u201cWhether driven by ideological zeal, nationalism, or money, non-state actors have long been a persistent phenomenon in international conflict, including cyber conflict.1 For instance, in 2001, Chinese hacktivists, encouraged by the state, targeted United States (US) government websites in retaliation for the EP-3 incident [24\u201327]. Taiwanese networks were also targeted during a period of growing cross-Strait tensions that same year [28]. Even the world\u2019s most notorious cyber conflict \u201cwake-up call\u201d [29], the attack on Estonia in 2007, was putatively facilitated by a pro-Russian youth organization [24, 30]. Such observations undoubtedly contributed to predictions that cyberspace would profoundly level the playing field between nation states and non-state actors [31].\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 3)", "\u201cBut states have not disappeared as a central actor, even in cyberspace. States which are host to non-state hackers can often co-opt these actors in order to advance operational objectives [32]. As Akoto [33] explains, \u201c[cyber] operations have proliferated ... [and] states are increasingly outsourcing them to non-state actors\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201ccyber proxies.\u201d2 I use the term \u201csponsor\u201d to refer to a sovereign power that relies on non-state actors to complete some operational cyber objective; to the non-state actor as that sponsor\u2019s \u201cproxy\u201d; and to this relationship as \u201coutsourcing,\u201d as opposed to \u201cinsourcing\u201d: centrally coordinated, direct action by the sponsor.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cFor tractability, I make a necessary assumption. As discussed, it is not possible to measure outsourcing per se because the more plausibly deniable operations are, the more likely they are to drop out of our datasets by pooling with non-state sponsored operations. I assume that aggressors have a consistently high demand for cyber operations in each period, which they can achieve either by insourcing or outsourcing (country/year fixed effects also help account for this unobserved variation, as discussed within). We cannot study outsourcing directly, but as long as this assumption holds, more insourcing should imply less outsourcing.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cScholars of cyber conflict would do well to take seriously this proposition. Writing on reasons for covert action in physical domains, Cormac and Aldrich [14] argue that \u201ceven in its supposed heyday, the concept [of plausible deniability] was deeply problematic. Changes in technology and the media, combined with the rise of special forces and private military companies, give it even less credibility today.\u201d These include advances in attribution technology, attribution from the private sector, media coverage, and the proliferation of in-house government cyber capabilities. Similarly, Lin-Greenberg and Milonopoulos [15] and Vaynman [16] have argued that open-source surveillance and monitoring technologies make it difficult for governments to hide their illicit activities in any domain. It stands to reason that this logic would hold for cyberspace as well. For instance, private cyber analysis firms have proliferated in number, and face fewer political barriers than states in making independent attributions. As Cormac and Aldrich [14] explain, \u201cwe live in an era of implausible deniability.\u201d\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cIn practice, the choice to outsource or centralize is not binary. States are free to pursue both strategies, with the understanding that resources must be divided. The model shows, however, that unless political attribution differs strongly between various operational applications, states are on average better off adopting the latter strategy. Empirical observations support these predictions, albeit only indirectly. The US government is both increasingly willing to indict host states for their connection to proxies, and increasingly capable of providing technical evidence to substantiate its accusations. Similarly, punishments may be more regularized under the US\u2019 new policy of persistent engagement, and more states now see an interest in fostering robust, centrally operated cyber institutions [55] as opposed to decentralized strategies, such as outsourcing.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cScholars have long been interested in the conditions under which new cyber norms can emerge and proliferate [106\u2013109]. Naval privateering was once common; states used letters of marque to commission pirates and mercenaries to conduct raids on their adversaries, but this strategy became obsolete in part because victims changed the norm by holding state sponsors responsible [110, 111]. Could new norms around state responsibility for cyberattacks also be coalescing around lower evidentiary barriers? This paper cannot, and does not, definitively contend that outsourcing is in fact on the decline. Instead, it is intended to caution against overreliance on untested assumptions about what states are doing and why they do it.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 32)", "\u201cEvery theory is based on core assumptions. The literature on cyber proxies has long assumed three points. First, cyber proxies offer plausible deniability. Second, sponsors desire plausible deniability, and therefore find proxies useful. Third, because of this, the use of proxies must be widespread. (As Section 3 will discuss in detail, absent large-n data, these assumptions have been difficult to challenge.) The third point has been demonstrated through anecdotes and case studies, but it has been difficult to measure changes in the global rate over time. Formal models can be used to illustrate how processes very different from the ones we assume can produce observationally equivalent, but possibly spurious, outcomes [92].\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 15)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2234%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A34%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999994%2C236.27751359999976%2C539.9982591999999%2C247.85014719999975%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C212.24996159999978%2C540.0021919999999%2C223.9780127999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C188.46251359999977%2C539.9984144%2C200.50139999999976%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C164.55451359999978%2C539.9982592%2C176.12714719999977%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C140.64651359999976%2C457.77039359999986%2C152.21914719999975%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2234%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber conflict scholarship is on the cusp of a more empirical turn.

Naval privateering was once common; states used letters of marque to commission pirates and mercenaries to conduct raids on their adversaries, but this strategy became obsolete in part because victims changed the norm by holding state sponsors responsible [110, 111]. Could new norms around state responsibility for cyberattacks also be coalescing around lower evidentiary barriers?

The literature on cyber proxies has long assumed three points. First, cyber proxies offer plausible deniability. Second, sponsors desire plausible deniability, and therefore find proxies useful. Third, because of this, the use of proxies must be widespread. (As Section 3 will discuss in detail, absent large-n data, these assumptions have been difficult to challenge.) The third point has been demonstrated through anecdotes and case studies, but it has been difficult to measure changes in the global rate over time. Formal models can be used to illustrate how processes very different from the ones we assume can produce observationally equivalent, but possibly spurious, outcomes [92].\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 15</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Outsourcing cyber power: Why proxy conflict in cyberspace may no longer pay", "abstract": "It is believed that states can achieve military and foreign policy objectives \u201con the cheap\u201d by outsourcing cyber operations to willing proxy actors, be they cyber mercenaries, patriotic zealots, pranksters, or simply allies of convenience.

If international relations were a courtroom, then proxies might not implicate their sponsors beyond a reasonable doubt. But pointing the finger in international relations is far more political. It is the victim that decides the burden of proof. Political attribution bridges the gap between technical facts and suspicions, \u201creducing uncertainty about who is behind an intrusion\u201d and \u201ccreating cybersecurity \u2018truths\u201d\u2019 for victims with the means to retaliate [90]. States may be learning that they can expect to be blamed even when victims cannot establish a rock solid evidentiary link. Even refusal to cooperate in stopping attacks emanating from within one\u2019s borders might be construed as tacit support. If so, advances in the technology of attribution, coupled with victim states\u2019 newfound willingness to make allegations on the basis of strong suspicion rather than hard evidence, may mean that deniability offers fewer advantages than it once did.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 14)", "\u201cAttribution \u03c4v is simply the probability of detection, determined by the target state\u2019s capabilities. Under the status quo law of state responsibility, even very sophisticated forensic techniques are often of little help to victims in making a case against sponsoring states for the actions of their agents. The target state must be able to show effective command oversight, and the burden of proof is on the target. This is usually not possible through technical means alone, unless the agents operate directly out of host government networks. Conversely, political attribution, \u03b1v > 1, is determined by the target state\u2019s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence. In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence. The government\u2019s payoff can be modeled as UG(\u03c6) = \u03c8u \u0303x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03b8\u03c6x \u2212 \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4v c (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + x(1 \u2212 \u03c6))\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 18)", "\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time. Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5). The second category, technical indicators, encompasses technical indicators like network traces and IoCs (index values: 2-3). These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1). Incidents with index values of 4 and especially 5 are of particular interest because, as opposed to proxy operations, government involvement is categorically undeniable no matter how strict the burden of proof is set. While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year. Lighter shades indicate stronger evidence that a government was involved. Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel. This relationship holds for each of the \u201cbig four\u201d US adversaries.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cEven if victims are able to trace the source of an attack, knowing who the people behind the terminal are and who they work for is a far more challenging set of questions. First, private sector targets are often the gatekeepers of forensic evidence and may have countervailing incentives not to disclose [33]. States are often sensitive about divulging how they know what they know [66]. Assuming a victim state is willing to broadcast the evidence it collected, the burden of proof to implicate a sponsoring state is prohibitively high as a matter of international law. Though the law is not completely settled, jurists usually interpret it to mean that only sponsors who take on a direct command role can be held responsible for the actions of their proxies [36, 67].14\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cIn the model, a host government faces a choice between outsourcing (turning a blind eye or actively supporting non-state actors) versus insourcing (conducting cyber operations using its own, in-house capabilities). Evidence is a function of how much a sponsor invests in the units charged with carrying out the attack. The more is invested, the more obviously the sponsor is linked to the operation. However, a key difference in the model is to relax the dependence between victims\u2019 beliefs and the level of investment. Under this framework, the sponsor\u2019s deniability is a function of its involvement and the target state\u2019s independent willingness to make accusations.

If international relations were a courtroom, then proxies might not implicate their sponsors beyond a reasonable doubt. But pointing the finger in international relations is far more political. It is the victim that decides the burden of proof. Political attribution bridges the gap between technical facts and suspicions, \u201creducing uncertainty about who is behind an intrusion\u201d and \u201ccreating cybersecurity \u2018truths\u201d\u2019 for victims with the means to retaliate [90]. States may be learning that they can expect to be blamed even when victims cannot establish a rock solid evidentiary link. Even refusal to cooperate in stopping attacks emanating from within one\u2019s borders might be construed as tacit support. If so, advances in the technology of attribution, coupled with victim states\u2019 newfound willingness to make allegations on the basis of strong suspicion rather than hard evidence, may mean that deniability offers fewer advantages than it once did.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 14</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C702.6169833%2C539.9964672000003%2C717.0114%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C681.0645135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C692.6371472%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C657.1565135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C668.7291471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C633.2485135999999%2C539.9982591999999%2C644.8211471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C609.3415135999999%2C539.9982592000006%2C620.9141471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C583.0779832999999%2C539.9999376%2C597.4723999999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C561.5255135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C573.0981471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C537.6175135999998%2C539.9982592000001%2C549.1901471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C513.7095135999998%2C411.1690240000001%2C525.2821471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C482.57851359999984%2C286.35673599999984%2C494.15114719999985%5D%2C%5B148.4919999999999%2C425.18498329999983%2C463.80942783999996%2C439.57939999999985%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution \u03c4v is simply the probability of detection, determined by the target state\u2019s capabilities. Under the status quo law of state responsibility, even very sophisticated forensic techniques are often of little help to victims in making a case against sponsoring states for the actions of their agents. The target state must be able to show effective command oversight, and the burden of proof is on the target. This is usually not possible through technical means alone, unless the agents operate directly out of host government networks. Conversely, political attribution, \u03b1v &gt; 1, is determined by the target state\u2019s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence. In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence.

Attribution is already hard, so plausible deniability should make for an additional hurdle. Yet victims can and do increasingly point the finger, even when attributions are imperfect [12, 13, 77, 78]. Cui bono (\u201cwho benefits?\u201d) tests are themselves commonly regarded by decisionmakers as a kind of evidence. A victim may still suspect its adversaries of being behind an attack perpetrated by ostensibly non-state hackers. In such a case, the target state might privately or publicly respond through an act of retorsion, naming and shaming, sanctioning, or launching a proportional cyber response. Since 2014, the US and other powerful states have even begun to publicly attribute cyber incidents to specific individuals that they say were working on behalf of sponsoring governments. Sometimes these are based on extensive evidence. In other cases, detailed evidence is not provided.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 12)", "\u201cAttribution \u03c4v is simply the probability of detection, determined by the target state\u2019s capabilities. Under the status quo law of state responsibility, even very sophisticated forensic techniques are often of little help to victims in making a case against sponsoring states for the actions of their agents. The target state must be able to show effective command oversight, and the burden of proof is on the target. This is usually not possible through technical means alone, unless the agents operate directly out of host government networks. Conversely, political attribution, \u03b1v > 1, is determined by the target state\u2019s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence. In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence. The government\u2019s payoff can be modeled as UG(\u03c6) = \u03c8u \u0303x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03b8\u03c6x \u2212 \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4v c (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + x(1 \u2212 \u03c6))\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 18)", "\u201cThis level of cooperation gives the government specially enhanced attribution capabilities. Carlin [43] describes the idea that the US has an attribution problem as \u201cantiquated.\u201d As former National Security Agency General Counsel Stewart Baker stated in 2015, \u201cwe can [now] know who our attackers are\" [Congressional testimony, quoted in 43]. Victims may be more willing to attribute their attackers when an attack has large-scale and high-profile consequences, even if evidence is weak [13].\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)", "\u201cSo just how prevalent are cyber proxies? How can we know? When making inferences about global patterns, researchers must rely on large-n datasets. The data are based on public reports and involve multiple hurdles \u2013 detection by the victim, admission and disclosure, sufficient evidence, media attention, and attribution. As Akoto [33] explains, these data limitations have \u201ccrippled efforts to study ... cyber proxies.\u201d Only in cases where the target detects an intrusion, admits to it, and alleges the involvement of a foreign state sponsor will that case will show up in open-source cyber conflict datasets.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cEspecially for these types of cases, DOJ has a strong motivation to attribute a state sponsor. DOJ depends on court-issued warrants for its investigatory powers, and warrants are often obtained by naming a nation state. As Carlin [43] admits, nation state attribution is actually crucial in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process: \"the government must demonstrate, among other things, that the \u2019target ... is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\u2019\" if it hopes to obtain a FISA warrant. Presumably this creates pressure for DOJ to implicate uncooperative states who are host to cyber attackers, whether or not the state-proxy evidence is rock solid.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)", "\u201cIn practice, the choice to outsource or centralize is not binary. States are free to pursue both strategies, with the understanding that resources must be divided. The model shows, however, that unless political attribution differs strongly between various operational applications, states are on average better off adopting the latter strategy. Empirical observations support these predictions, albeit only indirectly. The US government is both increasingly willing to indict host states for their connection to proxies, and increasingly capable of providing technical evidence to substantiate its accusations. Similarly, punishments may be more regularized under the US\u2019 new policy of persistent engagement, and more states now see an interest in fostering robust, centrally operated cyber institutions [55] as opposed to decentralized strategies, such as outsourcing.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cAfter all, why wouldn\u2019t victims overplay rather than underplay their hand? If international relations were a courtroom, then proxies might not implicate their sponsors beyond a reasonable doubt. But pointing the finger in international relations is far more political. It is the victim that decides the burden of proof. Political attribution bridges the gap between technical facts and suspicions, \u201creducing uncertainty about who is behind an intrusion\u201d and \u201ccreating cybersecurity \u2018truths\u201d\u2019 for victims with the means to retaliate [90]. States may be learning that they can expect to be blamed even when victims cannot establish a rock solid evidentiary link. Even refusal to cooperate in stopping attacks emanating from within one\u2019s borders might be construed as tacit support. If so, advances in the technology of attribution, coupled with victim states\u2019 newfound willingness to make allegations on the basis of strong suspicion rather than hard evidence, may mean that deniability offers fewer advantages than it once did.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 14)", "\u201cThere is no dataset that tracks negative variation in proxy relationships over time. As mentioned, EVIDENCE VALUE SUSPICIOUS TARGET Uniformed Personnel (5) Direct proof Implausibly deniable Agency/Contractor (4) Strong proof Implausibly deniable IoCs: Known Group (3) Technical proof Questionably deniable IoCs: Location (2) Technical proof Plausibly deniable Cui bono (1) Circumstantial proof Plausibly deniable No evidence (0) No proof Plausibly deniable Table 2: Quality of evidence cited in attribution for publicly known incidents in CFR dataset, indexed on a {0 : 5} scale. Higher values indicate more obvious sponsor involvement. The last column indicates the theorized level of political cover a sponsor obtains for the operation vis-a-vis a suspicious target state. Bolded values are dichotomized for Models 1 and 2 to differentiate physical evidence (about a person/agency behind the computer) from technical evidence (about the computer system alone).\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time. Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5). The second category, technical indicators, encompasses technical indicators like network traces and IoCs (index values: 2-3). These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1). Incidents with index values of 4 and especially 5 are of particular interest because, as opposed to proxy operations, government involvement is categorically undeniable no matter how strict the burden of proof is set. While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year. Lighter shades indicate stronger evidence that a government was involved. Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel. This relationship holds for each of the \u201cbig four\u201d US adversaries.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cWithout plausible deniability, would-be sponsors face a variety of disincentives. In conventional spaces, some speculate that outsourcing generally leads to wider disruption and collateral damage [20], whereas state control minimizes these byproducts [112]. In the cyber context, host states may not wish to risk bringing neutral parties into the fray, accidentally damaging assets in blue space, or violating emerging norms of international humanitarian law, such as the prohibition on attacking critical infrastructure in peacetime. Mounting evidence has also led some researchers and policymakers to cautiously conclude that cyber conflict is not inherently escalatory, anyway [56, 58]. If true, why jeopardize operational efficiency by outsourcing to outside actors who might be less-than-reliable? In converse, command centralization may come with advantages in terms of the division of skilled labor, economies of scale, and operational coherence.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 33)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2212%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999994%2C649.9335136%2C539.9982592000001%2C661.5061472%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C626.0255136%2C539.9982592000001%2C637.5981472%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C601.9989615999999%2C540.0002624%2C614.1573999999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C578.0909615999999%2C540.0018048%2C589.8190127999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C554.3025135999999%2C539.9982592000001%2C565.8751471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C530.3945135999999%2C539.9982592000001%2C541.9671471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C506.48651359999985%2C539.9982591999999%2C518.0591471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C482.57851359999984%2C539.9982592000001%2C494.15114719999985%5D%2C%5B72%2C458.67151359999986%2C539.9982592000001%2C470.2441471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C434.76351359999984%2C539.9982592000002%2C446.33614719999986%5D%2C%5B72%2C410.8555135999998%2C148.81216%2C422.42814719999984%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2212%22%7D%7D\">\u201cRarely do cyber attacks leave smoking gun evidence about who was involved.

In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence.

If international relations were a courtroom, then proxies might not implicate their sponsors beyond a reasonable doubt. But pointing the finger in international relations is far more political.

In conventional spaces, some speculate that outsourcing generally leads to wider disruption and collateral damage [20], whereas state control minimizes these byproducts [112]. In the cyber context, host states may not wish to risk bringing neutral parties into the fray, accidentally damaging assets in blue space, or violating emerging norms of international humanitarian law, such as the prohibition on attacking critical infrastructure in peacetime. Mounting evidence has also led some researchers and policymakers to cautiously conclude that cyber conflict is not inherently escalatory, anyway [56, 58]. If true, why jeopardize operational efficiency by outsourcing to outside actors who might be less-than-reliable? In converse, command centralization may come with advantages in terms of the division of skilled labor, economies of scale, and operational coherence.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 33</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Outsourcing cyber power: Why proxy conflict in cyberspace may no longer pay", "abstract": "It is believed that states can achieve military and foreign policy objectives \u201con the cheap\u201d by outsourcing cyber operations to willing proxy actors, be they cyber mercenaries, patriotic zealots, pranksters, or simply allies of convenience.

Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5).

These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1).

While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year.

Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel. This relationship holds for each of the \u201cbig four\u201d US adversaries.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cAttribution \u03c4v is simply the probability of detection, determined by the target state\u2019s capabilities. Under the status quo law of state responsibility, even very sophisticated forensic techniques are often of little help to victims in making a case against sponsoring states for the actions of their agents. The target state must be able to show effective command oversight, and the burden of proof is on the target. This is usually not possible through technical means alone, unless the agents operate directly out of host government networks. Conversely, political attribution, \u03b1v > 1, is determined by the target state\u2019s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence. In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence. The government\u2019s payoff can be modeled as UG(\u03c6) = \u03c8u \u0303x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03b8\u03c6x \u2212 \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4v c (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + x(1 \u2212 \u03c6))\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 18)", "\u201cEven if victims are able to trace the source of an attack, knowing who the people behind the terminal are and who they work for is a far more challenging set of questions. First, private sector targets are often the gatekeepers of forensic evidence and may have countervailing incentives not to disclose [33]. States are often sensitive about divulging how they know what they know [66]. Assuming a victim state is willing to broadcast the evidence it collected, the burden of proof to implicate a sponsoring state is prohibitively high as a matter of international law. Though the law is not completely settled, jurists usually interpret it to mean that only sponsors who take on a direct command role can be held responsible for the actions of their proxies [36, 67].14\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 11)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.00000000000001%2C530.3945135999998%2C539.9982592000002%2C541.9671471999998%5D%2C%5B72.00000000000001%2C506.48651359999974%2C539.9982592000003%2C518.0591471999998%5D%2C%5B72.00000000000001%2C482.5785135999997%2C539.9982592000003%2C494.15114719999974%5D%2C%5B72.00000000000001%2C458.67151359999974%2C539.9982592000001%2C470.24414719999976%5D%2C%5B72.00000000000001%2C434.7635135999997%2C539.9982592%2C446.33614719999974%5D%2C%5B72.00000000000001%2C410.8555135999997%2C540.0040016%2C422.89439999999973%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C386.9475135999997%2C539.9982592000003%2C398.5201471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C363.0395135999997%2C539.9982592000001%2C374.6121471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C339.1325135999997%2C539.9982591999999%2C350.7051471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C315.2245135999997%2C539.9982592000002%2C326.7971471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C291.31651359999967%2C375.3153792000001%2C302.8891471999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAfter all, why wouldn\u2019t victims overplay rather than underplay their hand?

Under the status quo law of state responsibility, even very sophisticated forensic techniques are often of little help to victims in making a case against sponsoring states for the actions of their agents. The target state must be able to show effective command oversight, and the burden of proof is on the target. This is usually not possible through technical means alone, unless the agents operate directly out of host government networks. Conversely, political attribution, \u03b1v &gt; 1, is determined by the target state\u2019s tolerance of circumstantial or legally insufficient evidence. In other words, technical attribution reflects a state\u2019s capability, whereas political attribution represents its willingness to act on the basis of nontechnical evidence.

States are often sensitive about divulging how they know what they know [66].

Evidentiary index values between 4 and 5 are coded as proof that country i was implicated in year j . In order to give plausible deniability maximal benefit of the doubt, values below this threshold, including strong IoCs, are coded as no proof having been observed. This distinguishes between direct involvement (undeniable) and indirect involvement (potentially plausibly deniable). It also ensures we are measuring insourcing per se, and not simply an accumulation of indirect, lower-level evidence. Without a clear way to quantify the scale or severity of a response, the other variable, US response, is also dichotomized for each country-year.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 29)", "\u201cFor simplicity, assume the return on investment is linearly increasing in average attack scale (u \u0303 = 1). Also equalize the \u03b8 assumption by also assuming centralization costs are trivial for high-capacity governments (\u03b3 \u2193 0), since these types have substantial resources at their disposal.21 Like the model employed by Lindsay [13], this setup allows us to locate the optimal attack scale. Since I regard x as an exogenous parameter \u2013 i.e. the level of force required to achieve an effect \u2013 rather than a choice, it is safe to treat the probability of success, \u03c8, as a constant. Set \u03c8 = 1 for the most interesting case. As a final simplification, assume technical attribution is certain whenever G attacks (\u03c4 = 1), and that the penalty c is linearly increasing in scale as a function of the cumulative evidence left behind x. This implies a one-to-one increase in the target\u2019s ability to implicate the host state if the host state runs the campaign directly, since in this case \u201cresponsibility\u201d can be proven through technical means alone. Set x, c = 1.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 19)", "\u201cThis set of assumptions simplifies the equation to UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 c (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + x(1 \u2212 \u03c6)). In order to constitute an equilibrium where G outsources, the equation must satisfy the Incentive Compatibility Condition (ICC). This implies \u03c6> 1 a which illustrates the general relationship between outsourcing (\u03c6) and the propensity of target states to react on the basis of circumstantial evidence. However, to make the analysis more interesting, relax the assumption that the scale of the campaign is endogenous to the amount of circumstantial evidence left behind. This instead gives us where expected sanctions are the same for any level of operational investment. I study the relationship between political attribution and \u03c6 in Theorem 1. Theorem 1. The higher the willingness of target states to hold the host state responsible for activity conducted within the latter\u2019s borders (\u03b1), the lower the host state\u2019s incentive to outsource (\u03c6). Proof of Theorem 1. Because this game is decision theoretic with only one move, there is no Nash solution concept. The decisionmaker locates the ideal level of \u03c6 via straightforward optimization. The proof is concise enough to show in the body of the paper. With no loss of generality, square the cost term and divide by two to make the objective function continuously differentiable in the choice variable: (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2, which gives us the transformation ma x UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2 The first order condition (FOC) must isolate at least one extremum in order to find a critical point at which G will choose to switch between strategies. Differentiate the function with respect to \u03c6: \u2202 \u2202 \u03c6 UG(\u00b7) = \u2212(\u03b1 + 1)(\u03b1\u03c6 + \u03c6 \u2212 1) \u2212 x We can then solve for the optimal level of \u03c6 by simply setting the derivative equal to zero and rearranging algebraically for \u03c6. This produces: \u03c6\u2217 = \u03b1 \u2212 x + 1 (\u03b1 + 1)2 where \u03b1 \u2265 0 by assumption (1) The second order condition (SOC) confirms that \u03c6\u2217 is indeed a global maximum: \u22022 \u2202 2\u03c6 UG(\u03c6) = \u2212a2 \u2212 2a \u2212 1 which is < 0 (2) We observe from Equation 2 that the slope is decreasing at U \u2032\u2032 G , proving that \u03c6\u2217 maximizes G\u2019s payoff function.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 20)", "\u201cSome non-state hackers cooperate with states for ideological reasons, not just money or glory. So-called \u201cpatriotic hackers\u201d first appeared as early as 1998 [44]. Among cyber proxies, patriotic hackers should offer their sponsors the best of both worlds. Would-be state sponsors face a classic principal-agent dilemma: by empowering non-state hackers, the state reaps the benefits of an operation while minimizing its exposure if the operation is traced to the perpetrators. But non-state hackers may have their own agenda. States that turn a blind eye run the risk of operational deviations, and states that provision their proxies with resources and material support may face a \u201cPromethean dilemma\u201d if those proxies later use their newfound capabilities against their sponsors [8]. Because patriotic hackers support state objectives for ideological reasons, the sponsoring state need not rely on side payments [45] to keep them in line. Without a money trail leading back to the sponsoring state, the usual principal-agent risks are minimized: the state can be assured of its proxy\u2019s fidelity, and plausible deniability is strengthened.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 5)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C197.6155135999997%2C539.9982591999999%2C209.1881471999997%5D%2C%5B72%2C173.7075135999997%2C539.9982592000003%2C185.28014719999967%5D%2C%5B72%2C149.67996159999967%2C540.0026287999999%2C161.40801279999968%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C125.89151359999966%2C539.9982591999999%2C137.46414719999964%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C101.98451359999966%2C539.9982592000001%2C113.55714719999966%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C78.07651359999966%2C539.9982592000001%2C89.64914719999966%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cNext, in order to construct the dependent variable for the first set of models (and independent variable in the second set of models), I dichotomize the evidence index.

Also equalize the \u03b8 assumption by also assuming centralization costs are trivial for high-capacity governments (\u03b3 \u2193 0), since these types have substantial resources at their disposal.21 Like the model employed by Lindsay [13], this setup allows us to locate the optimal attack scale. Since I regard x as an exogenous parameter \u2013 i.e. the level of force required to achieve an effect \u2013 rather than a choice, it is safe to treat the probability of success, \u03c8, as a constant. Set \u03c8 = 1 for the most interesting case. As a final simplification, assume technical attribution is certain whenever G attacks (\u03c4 = 1), and that the penalty c is linearly increasing in scale as a function of the cumulative evidence left behind x. This implies a one-to-one increase in the target\u2019s ability to implicate the host state if the host state runs the campaign directly, since in this case \u201cresponsibility\u201d can be proven through technical means alone.

I study the relationship between political attribution and \u03c6 in Theorem 1. Theorem 1. The higher the willingness of target states to hold the host state responsible for activity conducted within the latter\u2019s borders (\u03b1), the lower the host state\u2019s incentive to outsource (\u03c6). Proof of Theorem 1. Because this game is decision theoretic with only one move, there is no Nash solution concept. The decisionmaker locates the ideal level of \u03c6 via straightforward optimization. The proof is concise enough to show in the body of the paper. With no loss of generality, square the cost term and divide by two to make the objective function continuously differentiable in the choice variable: (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2, which gives us the transformation ma x UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2 The first order condition (FOC) must isolate at least one extremum in order to find a critical point at which G will choose to switch between strategies. Differentiate the function with respect to \u03c6: \u2202 \u2202 \u03c6 UG(\u00b7) = \u2212(\u03b1 + 1)(\u03b1\u03c6 + \u03c6 \u2212 1) \u2212 x We can then solve for the optimal level of \u03c6 by simply setting the derivative equal to zero and rearranging algebraically for \u03c6. This produces: \u03c6\u2217 = \u03b1 \u2212 x + 1 (\u03b1 + 1)2 where \u03b1 \u2265 0 by assumption (1) The second order condition (SOC) confirms that \u03c6\u2217 is indeed a global maximum: \u22022 \u2202 2\u03c6 UG(\u03c6) = \u2212a2 \u2212 2a \u2212 1 which is &lt; 0 (2) We observe from Equation 2 that the slope is decreasing at U \u2032\u2032 G , proving that \u03c6\u2217 maximizes G\u2019s payoff function.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n<h3></h3>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C602.1185135999999%2C539.9982591999999%2C613.6911471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C578.2105135999999%2C539.9975888%2C590.2493999999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C554.3025135999999%2C539.9982591999999%2C565.8751471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C530.3945135999999%2C539.9982592000001%2C541.9671471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C506.48651359999985%2C539.9982592000001%2C518.0591471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C482.57851359999984%2C539.9982591999999%2C494.15114719999985%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C458.67151359999986%2C539.9982592000001%2C470.2441471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C434.76351359999984%2C539.9982592000003%2C446.33614719999986%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C410.8555135999998%2C540.003224%2C422.89439999999985%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999996%2C386.9475135999998%2C539.9945024000003%2C398.98639999999983%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C363.0395135999998%2C539.9982592000001%2C374.6121471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C339.1325135999998%2C431.1102976000001%2C350.70514719999983%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSome non-state hackers cooperate with states for ideological reasons, not just money or glory. So-called \u201cpatriotic hackers\u201d first appeared as early as 1998 [44]. Among cyber proxies, patriotic hackers should offer their sponsors the best of both worlds. Would-be state sponsors face a classic principal-agent dilemma: by empowering non-state hackers, the state reaps the benefits of an operation while minimizing its exposure if the operation is traced to the perpetrators. But non-state hackers may have their own agenda. States that turn a blind eye run the risk of operational deviations, and states that provision their proxies with resources and material support may face a \u201cPromethean dilemma\u201d if those proxies later use their newfound capabilities against their sponsors [8]. Because patriotic hackers support state objectives for ideological reasons, the sponsoring state need not rely on side payments [45] to keep them in line. Without a money trail leading back to the sponsoring state, the usual principal-agent risks are minimized: the state can be assured of its proxy\u2019s fidelity, and plausible deniability is strengthened.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 5</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Outsourcing cyber power: Why proxy conflict in cyberspace may no longer pay", "abstract": "It is believed that states can achieve military and foreign policy objectives \u201con the cheap\u201d by outsourcing cyber operations to willing proxy actors, be they cyber mercenaries, patriotic zealots, pranksters, or simply allies of convenience.

A victim may still suspect its adversaries of being behind an attack perpetrated by ostensibly non-state hackers. In such a case, the target state might privately or publicly respond through an act of retorsion, naming and shaming, sanctioning, or launching a proportional cyber response. Since 2014, the US and other powerful states have even begun to publicly attribute cyber incidents to specific individuals that they say were working on behalf of sponsoring governments. Sometimes these are based on extensive evidence. In other cases, detailed evidence is not provided.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 12)", "\u201cIt has long been assumed that proxy conflict is attractive precisely because it offers state sponsors plausible deniability. This section theorizes about why that might no longer be true. In the early days of cyber conflict, attack attribution [59, 60] was widely regarded as its \u201cmost difficult problem\u201d [61]. The barriers to attribution prevented victims from identifying and holding aggressor accountable. It more recent years, however, the attribution problem has come to be seen as less problematic [62, 63]. Attribution may be onerous and complicated, but it is technically possible [12, 13, 64]. Victims typically work to piece together an idea of the likeliest culprits based on indicators of compromise (IOCs), an accumulation of technical clues and circumstantial patterns [65].\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cThere is no dataset that tracks negative variation in proxy relationships over time.

Higher values indicate more obvious sponsor involvement. The last column indicates the theorized level of political cover a sponsor obtains for the operation vis-a-vis a suspicious target state. Bolded values are dichotomized for Models 1 and 2 to differentiate physical evidence (about a person/agency behind the computer) from technical evidence (about the computer system alone).\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cModels 3 and 4 test the second question: at what evidentiary threshold is the US willing to cast blame? The independent and dependent variables (Observe Insourcing and Public Response, respectively) are on the same scale, but this time Insourcing is lagged by one year. We see that there is no significant association between the US having obtained irrefutable evidence of a sponsor\u2019s involvement and its willingness to respond publicly ( p = 0.35). The US may be able to more accurately detect and attribute systems, but its ability to implicate individuals is apparently unrelated how eagerly it retaliates against the usual suspects.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 31)", "\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time. Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5). The second category, technical indicators, encompasses technical indicators like network traces and IoCs (index values: 2-3). These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1). Incidents with index values of 4 and especially 5 are of particular interest because, as opposed to proxy operations, government involvement is categorically undeniable no matter how strict the burden of proof is set. While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year. Lighter shades indicate stronger evidence that a government was involved. Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel. This relationship holds for each of the \u201cbig four\u201d US adversaries.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cEspecially for these types of cases, DOJ has a strong motivation to attribute a state sponsor. DOJ depends on court-issued warrants for its investigatory powers, and warrants are often obtained by naming a nation state. As Carlin [43] admits, nation state attribution is actually crucial in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process: \"the government must demonstrate, among other things, that the \u2019target ... is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\u2019\" if it hopes to obtain a FISA warrant. Presumably this creates pressure for DOJ to implicate uncooperative states who are host to cyber attackers, whether or not the state-proxy evidence is rock solid.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2213%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999983%2C506.48651359999974%2C539.9982592%2C518.0591471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C482.5785135999997%2C539.9960559999998%2C494.61739999999975%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C458.67151359999974%2C539.9999583999997%2C470.71039999999977%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999977%2C434.7635135999997%2C540.0005903999997%2C446.80239999999975%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999972%2C410.8555135999997%2C539.9982591999999%2C422.4281471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999972%2C386.9475135999997%2C179.38144159999973%2C398.9863999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2213%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis level of cooperation gives the government specially enhanced attribution capabilities.

This section theorizes about why that might no longer be true. In the early days of cyber conflict, attack attribution [59, 60] was widely regarded as its \u201cmost difficult problem\u201d [61]. The barriers to attribution prevented victims from identifying and holding aggressor accountable. It more recent years, however, the attribution problem has come to be seen as less problematic [62, 63]. Attribution may be onerous and complicated, but it is technically possible [12, 13, 64]. Victims typically work to piece together an idea of the likeliest culprits based on indicators of compromise (IOCs), an accumulation of technical clues and circumstantial patterns [65].\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 10</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999997%2C75.2495135999997%2C539.9982592%2C86.8221471999997%5D%5D%2C%22nextPageRects%22%3A%5B%5B109.409%2C706.3055136%2C501.1865032%2C717.8781472000001%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C691.4092896000001%2C499.9375632000001%2C702.5754464%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C676.9632896%2C499.9375184%2C688.9424%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C662.4585136%2C502.5916176000001%2C674.0311472%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C648.0125136%2C480.64187040000013%2C659.5851472%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C633.5665136%2C480.6418704000001%2C645.1391472%5D%2C%5B109.409%2C619.1205136%2C480.6418704%2C630.6931472%5D%2C%5B72%2C595.0983613000001%2C540.0003900000005%2C605.6583701000001%5D%2C%5B72%2C581.5493613000001%2C540.0025361000003%2C592.1093701000001%5D%2C%5B72%2C568.0003613000001%2C540.0003900000002%2C578.5603701000001%5D%2C%5B72%2C554.4513613000001%2C540.0030329000006%2C565.0113701000001%5D%2C%5B72%2C540.9023613000002%2C507.72051520000014%2C551.8878250000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere is no dataset that tracks negative variation in proxy relationships over time.

DOJ depends on court-issued warrants for its investigatory powers, and warrants are often obtained by naming a nation state. As Carlin [43] admits, nation state attribution is actually crucial in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process: \"the government must demonstrate, among other things, that the \u2019target ... is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\u2019\" if it hopes to obtain a FISA warrant.

By outsourcing, this logic goes, a host government can claim plausible deniability while cashing in on strategic gains. Puzzlingly, proxy-associated behavior across three datasets appears to show that activity associated with outsourcing has flagged. Do cyber proxies still pay? A formal model is used to hypothesize about how new norms of attribution (specifically, the willingness of victims to make accusations on the basis of circumstantial evidence) are developing.

In order to give plausible deniability maximal benefit of the doubt, values below this threshold, including strong IoCs, are coded as no proof having been observed. This distinguishes between direct involvement (undeniable) and indirect involvement (potentially plausibly deniable). It also ensures we are measuring insourcing per se, and not simply an accumulation of indirect, lower-level evidence. Without a clear way to quantify the scale or severity of a response, the other variable, US response, is also dichotomized for each country-year.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 29)", "\u201cThe model shows how a sponsor\u2019s concern that victims will retaliate on the basis of imperfect or indirect evidence can be sufficient to discourage that sponsor from outsourcing. Note that this holds even when proxies are ideologically faithful and highly competent. In the real-world, outsourcing comes with all the downsides typically associated with a principal-agent relationship [8]. The model holds these widely established principal-agent problems constant at their ideal, setting them aside so that other mechanisms can be studied under controlled conditions. For this reason, the decision to outsource can be modeled as decision-theoretic. This permits a more specialized focus on plausible deniability\u2019s role in decisions about whether to outsource.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 16)", "\u201cThere is no dataset that tracks negative variation in proxy relationships over time.

Higher values indicate more obvious sponsor involvement. The last column indicates the theorized level of political cover a sponsor obtains for the operation vis-a-vis a suspicious target state. Bolded values are dichotomized for Models 1 and 2 to differentiate physical evidence (about a person/agency behind the computer) from technical evidence (about the computer system alone).\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cIn nontechnical terms, the conditions under which it pays more to outsource than to centralize are narrowed by target states\u2019 increased willingness to assign political blame on the basis of technically insufficient or legally inadmissible evidence. Detection plus suspicions may sometimes be enough. The knowledge that one could be held accountable, whether publicly or privately, removes the incentives to outsource, especially when proxies are unsophisticated, careless, inefficient, lack fidelity to the cause, or have their own ulterior agenda. Even when proxies are perfect efficient and reliable, political attribution can dampen the attractiveness of outsourcing strategies.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 23)", "\u201cExample 1. Suppose the target state upholds a strict interpretation of the law on state responsibility, such that it is reluctant to assign blame on the basis of any nontechnical evidence (\u03b1 = 0). Then the optimal level of outsourcing is \u03c6\u2217 = x and G would receive UG(\u03c6\u2217) = u \u0303x for any level of x. The value of x that maximizes this relationship is 1, so \u03c6\u2217 = 1. In other words, G gains plausible deniability for outsourcing and (absent any agent drift and assuming equal probability of success) the host stands to gain from outsourcing everything. It also implies (under identical conditions and assuming u \u0303 > 1) that G would adopt a totally permissive attitude toward its hacker pool, since more activity yields a strictly better payoff. This outcome captures the conventional wisdom. Example 2. How can we explain decisions not to outsource? Suppose a high willingness on the part of the target to politically attribute, e.g. \u03b1 = 10. Then \u03c6\u2217 = (10x2 + 11x)/121, and the calculation becomes more complex.22 Fixing \u03c6\u2217 = 0.148, x\u2217 = 0.895 at their optima (see previous footnote), G can expect to receive 0.148u \u0303. Note that G\u2019s maximum payoff is strictly (and significantly) lower when \u03b1 = 1 no matter what its strategy. Payoffs diminish further as \u03b1 increases or return on investment u \u0303 decreases, even when agents are perfectly loyal and highly capable, until rising penalties discourage the host government from outsourcing at all.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 22)", "\u201cIndictments still require a degree of legally admissible evidence, even if the governments understands the ability to actually convict on this evidentiary basis will never be tested. But even short of formal indictments, the US began acting on its suspicions when it initiated its new operating concept, persistent engagement [85\u201387]. To my knowledge, there is no institutional requirement to show that the target of a \u201chunt forward\u201d operation has legally demonstrable links to a host government. Would-be sponsors must certainly be aware that outsourcing does not automatically bestow political impunity. At best, outsourcing might only convey international legal protection in an environment where international law is already permissive; that is, for operations below the level of an armed attack [see 88]. Where once victim states like the US exhibited \u201crestrained responses\u201d [89], they now seem more willing to punish sponsors for the activities of their proxies.18\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 14)", "\u201cMoreover, the inclusion of fixed effects (in Models 1 and 2) should increase our confidence that the US response has strongly contributed to this trend. This approach ensures that any unobserved factors unique to a sponsor or time period are isolated and eliminated when they might affect the outcome. The same is true for Models 3 and 4, which estimate how the US responds to different countries over time depending on the evidence. Because other possible factors are accounted for by fixed effects, it \u201creduces concerns that omitted variables drive any associations between dependent and independent variable\u201d [104].\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 31)", "\u201cEspecially for these types of cases, DOJ has a strong motivation to attribute a state sponsor. DOJ depends on court-issued warrants for its investigatory powers, and warrants are often obtained by naming a nation state. As Carlin [43] admits, nation state attribution is actually crucial in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process: \"the government must demonstrate, among other things, that the \u2019target ... is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\u2019\" if it hopes to obtain a FISA warrant. Presumably this creates pressure for DOJ to implicate uncooperative states who are host to cyber attackers, whether or not the state-proxy evidence is rock solid.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C197.6155135999997%2C539.9982591999999%2C209.1881471999997%5D%2C%5B72%2C173.7075135999997%2C539.9982592000003%2C185.28014719999967%5D%2C%5B72%2C149.67996159999967%2C540.0026287999999%2C161.40801279999968%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C125.89151359999966%2C539.9982591999999%2C137.46414719999964%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C101.98451359999966%2C539.9982592000001%2C113.55714719999966%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C78.07651359999966%2C539.9982592000001%2C89.64914719999966%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cNext, in order to construct the dependent variable for the first set of models (and independent variable in the second set of models), I dichotomize the evidence index.

Suppose the target state upholds a strict interpretation of the law on state responsibility, such that it is reluctant to assign blame on the basis of any nontechnical evidence (\u03b1 = 0). Then the optimal level of outsourcing is \u03c6\u2217 = x and G would receive UG(\u03c6\u2217) = u \u0303x for any level of x. The value of x that maximizes this relationship is 1, so \u03c6\u2217 = 1. In other words, G gains plausible deniability for outsourcing and (absent any agent drift and assuming equal probability of success) the host stands to gain from outsourcing everything. It also implies (under identical conditions and assuming u \u0303 &gt; 1) that G would adopt a totally permissive attitude toward its hacker pool, since more activity yields a strictly better payoff. This outcome captures the conventional wisdom. Example 2. How can we explain decisions not to outsource? Suppose a high willingness on the part of the target to politically attribute, e.g. \u03b1 = 10. Then \u03c6\u2217 = (10x2 + 11x)/121, and the calculation becomes more complex.22 Fixing \u03c6\u2217 = 0.148, x\u2217 = 0.895 at their optima (see previous footnote), G can expect to receive 0.148u \u0303. Note that G\u2019s maximum payoff is strictly (and significantly) lower when \u03b1 = 1 no matter what its strategy.

Both countries have adopted stronger and more centralized domestic cyber institutions [55], and in 2016 Segal [71] described plans to adopt a model reminiscent of US Cyber Command.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C602.1185135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C613.6911471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C578.2105135999999%2C540.0031376000001%2C591.3847410999998%5D%2C%5B72%2C554.3025135999999%2C540.0006223999999%2C567.4767410999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C530.3945135999999%2C540.0046048000002%2C543.5697410999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C506.48651359999985%2C479.88967789999987%2C519.6617410999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTo illustrate this problem of observational equivalence, I compare observations from three datasets: Valeriano [56]\u2019s Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset 1.5 (\u201cVJM\u201d);5 the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Cyber Operations Tracker (\u201cCFR\u201d) [57];6 and Akoto [33]\u2019s dataset on cyber proxy onset.7 CFR [57] and VJM [56] track incidents in which state involvement was suspected, but neither differentiates between insourced and outsourced operations.8\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 7</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999983%2C331.9095135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C343.4821471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C308.0015135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C319.5741471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C284.09351359999977%2C539.9973376%2C296.1323999999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C260.18551359999975%2C539.9982591999998%2C271.75814719999977%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C236.27751359999974%2C539.9982591999999%2C247.85014719999972%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C212.36951359999972%2C539.9982591999999%2C223.9421471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C188.4625135999997%2C539.9982592000001%2C200.0351471999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDetection and attribution in cyberspace are challenging, but not impossible. Because of this, it is widely believed that the use of a proxy bestows sponsoring states with an added layer of plausible deniability [8, 35, 37\u201342]. Cyber proxies by definition operate under a different command structure and may work physically apart from regular uniformed personnel. Even if a perpetrator can be tracked down, organizational separation between that perpetrator and the principal to whom she reports can make it difficult for victims to know the principal\u2019s involvement.

In 2014, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) famously indicted five Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) officers for allegedly \u201chacking under the shadow of their country\u2019s flag\u201d in order to escape punishment [79]. Though an indictment under US criminal law signaled the government\u2019s view that the suspects were individuals, the attribution to China was explicit. Comparing this 2014 indictment to the Equifax hack three years later, observe that DOJ named 30 accomplices [80] a sixfold uptick in the number of implicated individuals. The US government has continued to aggressively indict foreign hackers it considers to be nation-state proxies [eg. 81\u201385]. Speaking on behalf of the US government, former US Acting Deputy Attorney General John Carlin argued that proxies \u201care not immune from the law\u201d and that the US \u201cwill hold state sponsored cyber thieves accountable\u201d [79].\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2212%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 12</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Outsourcing cyber power: Why proxy conflict in cyberspace may no longer pay", "abstract": "It is believed that states can achieve military and foreign policy objectives \u201con the cheap\u201d by outsourcing cyber operations to willing proxy actors, be they cyber mercenaries, patriotic zealots, pranksters, or simply allies of convenience.

Russia [35, 46], China [25, 26], Iran [40], and North Korea [47] \u2013 all of which possess their own powerful cyber capabilities \u2013 are usually regarded as the most complicit. Standard accounts rarely note how the outsourcing model has been at various stages endorsed in countries like Japan, India, and Estonia [45, 48], and (allegedly) employed by several Western countries [38, 42, 49\u201351]. On the other hand, scholars acknowledge that proxies are not ubiquitous. The US has traditionally kept its non-state hacker community on a tight leash by discouraging operational participation [35, 46].4 Between 9/11 and the start of the Iraq War, for example, when US nationalism soared, the US National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) posted a notice explicitly warning overzealous Americans not to hack Iraqi targets [53]. On the surface this might seem surprising, since the US shown little reluctance to engage in proxy warfare in other domains.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cCyber conflict scholarship is on the cusp of a more empirical turn. In addition to the rich body of qualitative work already prevalent in cyber conflict studies, quantitative and large-n studies can provide special insight into broader patterns [eg. 54, 56]. Moving forward, tools that ensure that the theoretical predictions underpinning empirical studies are clear, parsimonious, and internally consistent will be especially valuable, regardless of methodological orientation.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 34)", "\u201cIt is worth examining how, practically speaking, the US DOJ is able to piece together an argument that cyber incidents are indeed \u201cstate-sponsored.\u201d16 In a separate piece, Carlin [43] explains that the Criminal and National Security Divisions at DOJ \"increasingly find [them]selves working cases jointly (or at least more actively supporting each other\u2019s cases),\" including by embedding special agents from Counterintelligence with the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division.

But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations. Both countries have adopted stronger and more centralized domestic cyber institutions [55], and in 2016 Segal [71] described plans to adopt a model reminiscent of US Cyber Command.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cTo illustrate this problem of observational equivalence, I compare observations from three datasets: Valeriano [56]\u2019s Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset 1.5 (\u201cVJM\u201d);5 the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Cyber Operations Tracker (\u201cCFR\u201d) [57];6 and Akoto [33]\u2019s dataset on cyber proxy onset.7 CFR [57] and VJM [56] track incidents in which state involvement was suspected, but neither differentiates between insourced and outsourced operations.8\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cDetection and attribution in cyberspace are challenging, but not impossible.

Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations.

By outsourcing, this logic goes, a host government can claim plausible deniability while cashing in on strategic gains. Puzzlingly, proxy-associated behavior across three datasets appears to show that activity associated with outsourcing has flagged. Do cyber proxies still pay? A formal model is used to hypothesize about how new norms of attribution (specifically, the willingness of victims to make accusations on the basis of circumstantial evidence) are developing.

Evidence is a function of how much a sponsor invests in the units charged with carrying out the attack. The more is invested, the more obviously the sponsor is linked to the operation. However, a key difference in the model is to relax the dependence between victims\u2019 beliefs and the level of investment. Under this framework, the sponsor\u2019s deniability is a function of its involvement and the target state\u2019s independent willingness to make accusations. This is a generalization of the conventional wisdom, since it does not assume that all victims have an identical standard for the burden of proof.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cCyber conflict scholarship is on the cusp of a more empirical turn. In addition to the rich body of qualitative work already prevalent in cyber conflict studies, quantitative and large-n studies can provide special insight into broader patterns [eg. 54, 56]. Moving forward, tools that ensure that the theoretical predictions underpinning empirical studies are clear, parsimonious, and internally consistent will be especially valuable, regardless of methodological orientation.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 34)", "\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time. Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5). The second category, technical indicators, encompasses technical indicators like network traces and IoCs (index values: 2-3). These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1). Incidents with index values of 4 and especially 5 are of particular interest because, as opposed to proxy operations, government involvement is categorically undeniable no matter how strict the burden of proof is set. While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year. Lighter shades indicate stronger evidence that a government was involved. Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel.

But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69].

This is a generalization of the conventional wisdom, since it does not assume that all victims have an identical standard for the burden of proof.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 15</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2234%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A34%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999994%2C236.27751359999976%2C539.9982591999999%2C247.85014719999975%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C212.24996159999978%2C540.0021919999999%2C223.9780127999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C188.46251359999977%2C539.9984144%2C200.50139999999976%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C164.55451359999978%2C539.9982592%2C176.12714719999977%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C140.64651359999976%2C457.77039359999986%2C152.21914719999975%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2234%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber conflict scholarship is on the cusp of a more empirical turn.

But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations. Both countries have adopted stronger and more centralized domestic cyber institutions [55], and in 2016 Segal [71] described plans to adopt a model reminiscent of US Cyber Command.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B71.99999999999983%2C331.9095135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C343.4821471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C308.0015135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C319.5741471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C284.09351359999977%2C539.9973376%2C296.1323999999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C260.18551359999975%2C539.9982591999998%2C271.75814719999977%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C236.27751359999974%2C539.9982591999999%2C247.85014719999972%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C212.36951359999972%2C539.9982591999999%2C223.9421471999997%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999983%2C188.4625135999997%2C539.9982592000001%2C200.0351471999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDetection and attribution in cyberspace are challenging, but not impossible. Because of this, it is widely believed that the use of a proxy bestows sponsoring states with an added layer of plausible deniability [8, 35, 37\u201342]. Cyber proxies by definition operate under a different command structure and may work physically apart from regular uniformed personnel.

To date, some 400,000 multinational hackers have reportedly volunteered to aid the besieged Ukrainian government against Russia in the ongoing 2022 war [17]. Ukrainian officials have openly welcomed their assistance. Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Digital Transformation even tweeted an open invitation to join his \u201cIT army\u201d and to \u201cfight on the cyber front\u201d [18]. By doing so, of course, Ukraine cannot plausibly deny a relationship with its proxies. Nor would it presumably care to, given the state of war. Proxies may still sometimes pay, but if or when they do, it must be for reasons other than political cover.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 3)", "\u201cIn the model, a host government faces a choice between outsourcing (turning a blind eye or actively supporting non-state actors) versus insourcing (conducting cyber operations using its own, in-house capabilities). Evidence is a function of how much a sponsor invests in the units charged with carrying out the attack. The more is invested, the more obviously the sponsor is linked to the operation. However, a key difference in the model is to relax the dependence between victims\u2019 beliefs and the level of investment. Under this framework, the sponsor\u2019s deniability is a function of its involvement and the target state\u2019s independent willingness to make accusations. This is a generalization of the conventional wisdom, since it does not assume that all victims have an identical standard for the burden of proof.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cIt is worth examining how, practically speaking, the US DOJ is able to piece together an argument that cyber incidents are indeed \u201cstate-sponsored.\u201d16 In a separate piece, Carlin [43] explains that the Criminal and National Security Divisions at DOJ \"increasingly find [them]selves working cases jointly (or at least more actively supporting each other\u2019s cases),\" including by embedding special agents from Counterintelligence with the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division.

In addition to the rich body of qualitative work already prevalent in cyber conflict studies, quantitative and large-n studies can provide special insight into broader patterns [eg. 54, 56]. Moving forward, tools that ensure that the theoretical predictions underpinning empirical studies are clear, parsimonious, and internally consistent will be especially valuable, regardless of methodological orientation.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 34)", "\u201cThese barriers are what make outsourcing so attractive, according to conventional wisdom [35]. But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations.

Evidence is a function of how much a sponsor invests in the units charged with carrying out the attack. The more is invested, the more obviously the sponsor is linked to the operation. However, a key difference in the model is to relax the dependence between victims\u2019 beliefs and the level of investment. Under this framework, the sponsor\u2019s deniability is a function of its involvement and the target state\u2019s independent willingness to make accusations.

But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]?

Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70].

Evidence is a function of how much a sponsor invests in the units charged with carrying out the attack. The more is invested, the more obviously the sponsor is linked to the operation. However, a key difference in the model is to relax the dependence between victims\u2019 beliefs and the level of investment. Under this framework, the sponsor\u2019s deniability is a function of its involvement and the target state\u2019s independent willingness to make accusations. This is a generalization of the conventional wisdom, since it does not assume that all victims have an identical standard for the burden of proof.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cCyber conflict scholarship is on the cusp of a more empirical turn. In addition to the rich body of qualitative work already prevalent in cyber conflict studies, quantitative and large-n studies can provide special insight into broader patterns [eg. 54, 56]. Moving forward, tools that ensure that the theoretical predictions underpinning empirical studies are clear, parsimonious, and internally consistent will be especially valuable, regardless of methodological orientation.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 34)", "\u201cIt is worth examining how, practically speaking, the US DOJ is able to piece together an argument that cyber incidents are indeed \u201cstate-sponsored.\u201d16 In a separate piece, Carlin [43] explains that the Criminal and National Security Divisions at DOJ \"increasingly find [them]selves working cases jointly (or at least more actively supporting each other\u2019s cases),\" including by embedding special agents from Counterintelligence with the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division. Enabled by post-9/11 changes to the structure of the intelligence community, these interagency and public-private collaborations \u2013 in Carlin\u2019s own words \u2013 were motivated by the early cyber proxy landscape.17\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 13)", "\u201cThese barriers are what make outsourcing so attractive, according to conventional wisdom [35]. But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations. Both countries have adopted stronger and more centralized domestic cyber institutions [55], and in 2016 Segal [71] described plans to adopt a model reminiscent of US Cyber Command.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cTo illustrate this problem of observational equivalence, I compare observations from three datasets: Valeriano [56]\u2019s Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset 1.5 (\u201cVJM\u201d);5 the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Cyber Operations Tracker (\u201cCFR\u201d) [57];6 and Akoto [33]\u2019s dataset on cyber proxy onset.7 CFR [57] and VJM [56] track incidents in which state involvement was suspected, but neither differentiates between insourced and outsourced operations.8\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time. Lighter colors indicate more direct evidence that state personnel, rather than non-state proxies, were involved (index values: 4-5). The second category, technical indicators, encompasses technical indicators like network traces and IoCs (index values: 2-3). These technical indicators can be contrasted to the third category, unconfirmed suspicions (index values: 0-1). Incidents with index values of 4 and especially 5 are of particular interest because, as opposed to proxy operations, government involvement is categorically undeniable no matter how strict the burden of proof is set. While a Figure 3: Type of evidence used in support of attributions. The density plot is filled to control for variation in the number of detected operations per year. Lighter shades indicate stronger evidence that a government was involved. Evidence that directly implicates a government culprit (ie. undeniable involvement) is increasing in share over time. greater share of technical evidence has been offered since 2013, direct evidence has become by far the most common form of proof.27 Footnoted caveats notwithstanding, this should imply that states are conducting more operations with their own uniformed personnel. This relationship holds for each of the \u201cbig four\u201d US adversaries.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cDetection and attribution in cyberspace are challenging, but not impossible. Because of this, it is widely believed that the use of a proxy bestows sponsoring states with an added layer of plausible deniability [8, 35, 37\u201342]. Cyber proxies by definition operate under a different command structure and may work physically apart from regular uniformed personnel. Even if a perpetrator can be tracked down, organizational separation between that perpetrator and the principal to whom she reports can make it difficult for victims to know the principal\u2019s involvement.

But assuming cyber proxies convey plausible deniability for their sponsors, and sponsors find plausible deniability desirable, why is reliance on proxies not universal [33, 68]? In the US case, scholars often point to philosophical disagreements between Washington and Silicon Valley [e.g. 35]. Others have argued that authoritarian countries and democracies face disparate accountability barriers [33, 69]. A debate exists as to the real prevalence of proxies among authoritarian countries, as well [see 70]. Russia and China have since 2016 exhibited an increased interest in more tightly-controlled cyber operations. Both countries have adopted stronger and more centralized domestic cyber institutions [55], and in 2016 Segal [71] described plans to adopt a model reminiscent of US Cyber Command.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C602.1185135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C613.6911471999999%5D%2C%5B72%2C578.2105135999999%2C540.0031376000001%2C591.3847410999998%5D%2C%5B72%2C554.3025135999999%2C540.0006223999999%2C567.4767410999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999994%2C530.3945135999999%2C540.0046048000002%2C543.5697410999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C506.48651359999985%2C479.88967789999987%2C519.6617410999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTo illustrate this problem of observational equivalence, I compare observations from three datasets: Valeriano [56]\u2019s Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute Dataset 1.5 (\u201cVJM\u201d);5 the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Cyber Operations Tracker (\u201cCFR\u201d) [57];6 and Akoto [33]\u2019s dataset on cyber proxy onset.7 CFR [57] and VJM [56] track incidents in which state involvement was suspected, but neither differentiates between insourced and outsourced operations.8\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 7</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C300.77851359999966%2C539.9982592000003%2C312.3511471999997%5D%2C%5B72%2C276.87051359999964%2C539.9970912000001%2C288.44314719999966%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C252.96251359999962%2C540.0029440000003%2C264.53514719999964%5D%2C%5B72%2C229.0545135999996%2C539.9982592000003%2C240.6271471999996%5D%2C%5B72%2C205.1475135999996%2C539.9965424000004%2C216.7201471999996%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C181.2395135999996%2C539.9982591999999%2C192.8121471999996%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999997%2C157.3315135999996%2C539.9982592000002%2C168.90414719999958%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn Figure 3, we can see how insourcing has changed over time.

Because of this, it is widely believed that the use of a proxy bestows sponsoring states with an added layer of plausible deniability [8, 35, 37\u201342].

Cui bono (\u201cwho benefits?\u201d) tests are themselves commonly regarded by decisionmakers as a kind of evidence. A victim may still suspect its adversaries of being behind an attack perpetrated by ostensibly non-state hackers. In such a case, the target state might privately or publicly respond through an act of retorsion, naming and shaming, sanctioning, or launching a proportional cyber response.

Moreover, since 2014, the quality of evidence regarding state involvement seems to have no predictive value in whether victims respond. Attribution may be getting more sophisticated, but victims\u2019 suspicions are basis enough. In either case, attackers lose their political cover from outsourcing.31\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 33)", "\u201cThis set of assumptions simplifies the equation to UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 c (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + x(1 \u2212 \u03c6)). In order to constitute an equilibrium where G outsources, the equation must satisfy the Incentive Compatibility Condition (ICC). This implies \u03c6> 1 a which illustrates the general relationship between outsourcing (\u03c6) and the propensity of target states to react on the basis of circumstantial evidence. However, to make the analysis more interesting, relax the assumption that the scale of the campaign is endogenous to the amount of circumstantial evidence left behind. This instead gives us where expected sanctions are the same for any level of operational investment. I study the relationship between political attribution and \u03c6 in Theorem 1. Theorem 1. The higher the willingness of target states to hold the host state responsible for activity conducted within the latter\u2019s borders (\u03b1), the lower the host state\u2019s incentive to outsource (\u03c6). Proof of Theorem 1. Because this game is decision theoretic with only one move, there is no Nash solution concept. The decisionmaker locates the ideal level of \u03c6 via straightforward optimization. The proof is concise enough to show in the body of the paper. With no loss of generality, square the cost term and divide by two to make the objective function continuously differentiable in the choice variable: (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2, which gives us the transformation ma x UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2 The first order condition (FOC) must isolate at least one extremum in order to find a critical point at which G will choose to switch between strategies. Differentiate the function with respect to \u03c6: \u2202 \u2202 \u03c6 UG(\u00b7) = \u2212(\u03b1 + 1)(\u03b1\u03c6 + \u03c6 \u2212 1) \u2212 x We can then solve for the optimal level of \u03c6 by simply setting the derivative equal to zero and rearranging algebraically for \u03c6. This produces: \u03c6\u2217 = \u03b1 \u2212 x + 1 (\u03b1 + 1)2 where \u03b1 \u2265 0 by assumption (1) The second order condition (SOC) confirms that \u03c6\u2217 is indeed a global maximum: \u22022 \u2202 2\u03c6 UG(\u03c6) = \u2212a2 \u2212 2a \u2212 1 which is < 0 (2) We observe from Equation 2 that the slope is decreasing at U \u2032\u2032 G , proving that \u03c6\u2217 maximizes G\u2019s payoff function.\u201d (Canfil, 2020, p. 20)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGMJ49DID%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C702.6169833%2C539.9964672000003%2C717.0114%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C681.0645135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C692.6371472%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C657.1565135999999%2C539.9982592000002%2C668.7291471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C633.2485135999999%2C539.9982591999999%2C644.8211471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C609.3415135999999%2C539.9982592000006%2C620.9141471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C583.0779832999999%2C539.9999376%2C597.4723999999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C561.5255135999998%2C539.9982591999999%2C573.0981471999999%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C537.6175135999998%2C539.9982592000001%2C549.1901471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C513.7095135999998%2C411.1690240000001%2C525.2821471999998%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999989%2C482.57851359999984%2C286.35673599999984%2C494.15114719999985%5D%2C%5B148.4919999999999%2C425.18498329999983%2C463.80942783999996%2C439.57939999999985%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution \u03c4v is simply the probability of detection, determined by the target state\u2019s capabilities.

I study the relationship between political attribution and \u03c6 in Theorem 1. Theorem 1. The higher the willingness of target states to hold the host state responsible for activity conducted within the latter\u2019s borders (\u03b1), the lower the host state\u2019s incentive to outsource (\u03c6). Proof of Theorem 1. Because this game is decision theoretic with only one move, there is no Nash solution concept. The decisionmaker locates the ideal level of \u03c6 via straightforward optimization. The proof is concise enough to show in the body of the paper. With no loss of generality, square the cost term and divide by two to make the objective function continuously differentiable in the choice variable: (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2, which gives us the transformation ma x UG(\u03c6) = x(2 \u2212 \u03c6) \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03b1v(\u03c6) + (1 \u2212 \u03c6))2 The first order condition (FOC) must isolate at least one extremum in order to find a critical point at which G will choose to switch between strategies. Differentiate the function with respect to \u03c6: \u2202 \u2202 \u03c6 UG(\u00b7) = \u2212(\u03b1 + 1)(\u03b1\u03c6 + \u03c6 \u2212 1) \u2212 x We can then solve for the optimal level of \u03c6 by simply setting the derivative equal to zero and rearranging algebraically for \u03c6. This produces: \u03c6\u2217 = \u03b1 \u2212 x + 1 (\u03b1 + 1)2 where \u03b1 \u2265 0 by assumption (1) The second order condition (SOC) confirms that \u03c6\u2217 is indeed a global maximum: \u22022 \u2202 2\u03c6 UG(\u03c6) = \u2212a2 \u2212 2a \u2212 1 which is &lt; 0 (2) We observe from Equation 2 that the slope is decreasing at U \u2032\u2032 G , proving that \u03c6\u2217 maximizes G\u2019s payoff function.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWL69LC46%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2020, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n<h3></h3>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Outsourcing cyber power: Why proxy conflict in cyberspace may no longer pay", "abstract": "It is believed that states can achieve military and foreign policy objectives \u201con the cheap\u201d by outsourcing cyber operations to willing proxy actors, be they cyber mercenaries, patriotic zealots, pranksters, or simply allies of convenience.
