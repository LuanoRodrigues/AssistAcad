Accordingly, we can expect that any transformation of cyber attribution will \u201cbe co-constituted by technological possibilities, political choices, and scientific practices\u201d (Dunn Cavelty and Wenger 2020). This chapter examines some of the current practices of attribution, scientific developments in the field, and possibilities for its transnational institutionalization.1\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 220)", "\u201cThe work by Chernenko et al. paper presents an interesting contrast to the IAEA model for attribution. While not denying the significance of private sector actors, the Chernenko et al. proposal is explicitly state based, recommending an \u201cindependent, international cyber court ... that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). This scoping is less expansive than the Microsoft proposal, but more inclusive than the Atlantic Council\u2019s, covering government-level cyber conflict which would include those below the threshold of armed conflict.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThis chapter has briefly described the state of play in cyber attribution and number of competing visions for its future. At present, threat intelligence firms and national security agencies are the primary producers of forensic data and attributions. While reliance on algorithms to cluster observed data and identify infrastructure and adversaries is advancing this introduces socio-technical uncertainties around how data is collected, shared, and analyzed. Coupled with political fragmentation and strategic behavior by states there is need to focus on the institutionalization of credible, independent attribution. While ideal models for making attribution were described, too little is known about the current state of affairs.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cWhile the political dimension of attribution might be quantified, it is necessarily relational, a product more of political science or intelligence studies than computer science. As sanctions or other disincentives are used to punish offensive cyber operations, we might expect cyber operations to adjust by taking steps to disguise their identity. The CIA\u2019s leaked Marble Framework, for example, has been described as providing the capability to change the language of the source code from English to another language like Russian or Farsi (Burgess 2017). Meanwhile, cyber tools invented by one country are being reused by another. This suggests a technical race between forensic experts and counter-forensic obfuscation. While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223)", "\u201cEach proposal offers different scopes of activity for a cyber attribution organization and pushes for dramatically different structures (e.g., multilateral vs. nongovernmental, or hierarchical vs. networked). And while the RAND Report makes powerful arguments as to why states have conflicting incentives to participate in an attribution organization and cautions against their membership in any Consortium, none of the above proposals explicitly consider the incentives for private actors to participate in the forensic process. The authors are tracking the aforementioned proposals and critiquing their viability, but believe more research is needed before a consensus can form.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe cyberspace domain is uniquely defined by private sector participation and ownership of the core infrastructure. In this respect, Microsoft\u2019s Digital Geneva Convention is served well by including the private sector but creates a potential contradiction by drawing on the example of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is possible to imagine an independent, member state-funded international organization, like that of the IAEA. Or by empowering the private sector, academia, and civil society is Microsoft suggesting a multistakeholder model? At face value, it appears that governments will set the rules, while private actors will lend their services and data, but nothing is stated about how these interests might be aligned. If a subset of private sector cyber security firms has advanced forensic capability equaling or exceeding that of most states, why would they participate in a monopsony attribution organization? Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs. Alternatively, if access to the internet\u2019s infrastructure allows an investigation to backtrack the origins of an attacker, what process should enable the acquisition of relevant evidence? Should this layer of attribution include partnerships with national law enforcement or permit international inspections? Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cThe apparent success of these efforts was institutionalized, with a ministerial and communique expressing that the states \u201cwould coordinate on appropriate responses and attribution\u201d (Department of Homeland Affairs Australian Government 2018). However, this agreement was only among the Five Eyes, which raises the question whether or not collective attributions made by those states will be accepted more broadly. Moreover, this initiative focuses on \u201ccoordinating technical attribution and operational response policies to mitigate significant cyber incidents\u201d and does not discuss the attribution process.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 230)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting. (National Cyber Security Center of New Zealand 2016)\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cOur preliminary research has started to categorize the origin and characteristics of publicly attributed incidents. This work builds on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) dataset of state-sponsored cyber incident2 (Segal and Grigsby 2018). Reviewing 82 incidents identified by CFR between 2016 and the first quarter of 2018 (Table 15.1), we coded each case, identifying whether states and/or private actors made a public attribution, as well as details related to the attribution,3 including timing and outcome.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C456.1810140625%2C388.22599999999966%2C464.96410000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C444.1810140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C452.96410000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C432.1810140625%2C388.2119999999995%2C440.96410000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C420.1810140625%2C388.2119999999998%2C428.96410000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C408.1810140625%2C388.20599999999973%2C416.96410000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C396.1810140625%2C291.88570000000004%2C405.53346%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cLike the broader field of cyber security, cyber attribution is a socio-technical endeavor.

Meanwhile, cyber tools invented by one country are being reused by another. This suggests a technical race between forensic experts and counter-forensic obfuscation. While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C553.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C388.20299999999963%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.2100000000001%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.20799999999974%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C388.2099999999997%2C501.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.2104140625%2C388.22399999999993%2C489.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C469.2104140625%2C388.2099999999998%2C477.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C457.2104140625%2C220.33999999999997%2C465.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEach proposal offers different scopes of activity for a cyber attribution organization and pushes for dramatically different structures (e.g., multilateral vs. nongovernmental, or hierarchical vs. networked).

In this respect, Microsoft\u2019s Digital Geneva Convention is served well by including the private sector but creates a potential contradiction by drawing on the example of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is possible to imagine an independent, member state-funded international organization, like that of the IAEA. Or by empowering the private sector, academia, and civil society is Microsoft suggesting a multistakeholder model? At face value, it appears that governments will set the rules, while private actors will lend their services and data, but nothing is stated about how these interests might be aligned. If a subset of private sector cyber security firms has advanced forensic capability equaling or exceeding that of most states, why would they participate in a monopsony attribution organization? Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs. Alternatively, if access to the internet\u2019s infrastructure allows an investigation to backtrack the origins of an attacker, what process should enable the acquisition of relevant evidence? Should this layer of attribution include partnerships with national law enforcement or permit international inspections? Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22230%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C577.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C585.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C565.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C573.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C553.2104140625%2C388.2099999999999%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C388.20999999999987%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.2039999999997%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C326.7399999999997%2C501.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22230%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe apparent success of these efforts was institutionalized, with a ministerial and communique expressing that the states \u201cwould coordinate on appropriate responses and attribution\u201d (Department of Homeland Affairs Australian Government 2018).

It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cEach proposal offers different scopes of activity for a cyber attribution organization and pushes for dramatically different structures (e.g., multilateral vs. nongovernmental, or hierarchical vs. networked). And while the RAND Report makes powerful arguments as to why states have conflicting incentives to participate in an attribution organization and cautions against their membership in any Consortium, none of the above proposals explicitly consider the incentives for private actors to participate in the forensic process. The authors are tracking the aforementioned proposals and critiquing their viability, but believe more research is needed before a consensus can form.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22230%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.1999999999998%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.21499999999986%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22230%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions.

The authors are tracking the aforementioned proposals and critiquing their viability, but believe more research is needed before a consensus can form.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C445.2104140625%2C388.21399999999966%2C453.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C433.2104140625%2C388.20099999999974%2C441.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C421.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C409.2104140625%2C388.20599999999973%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C397.2104140625%2C388.2189999999998%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C385.2104140625%2C388.2089999999997%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C373.2104140625%2C388.21699999999987%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C361.2104140625%2C388.20999999999987%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C349.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C337.2104140625%2C388.2119999999998%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21099999999973%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2149999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C340.6217999999999%2C297.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts. While governments and threat intelligence groups will attribute attacks to specific intrusion sets, sometimes even linking these to specific actors, there is no internationally recognized forensic process with an evidentiary based level of confidence. Rather, attribution is more often than not based on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity. Considering that both attributing groups and attackers could be based anywhere in the world, without a recognized standardized and institutionalized process for attribution, can we expect a global coalition to implement sanctions or otherwise deter the attacker?\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cBoth technological developments and better understanding of how states act strategically highlight the need for institutionalizing neutral, transnational attribution. At some point, the evidence has to be assessed and independently reviewed, and that cannot be carried out through technological means alone. A decision to blame a responsible party has to take place through a recognized collective attribution process. Such a process has not been implemented, nor have current processes been studied in detail.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 230)", "\u201cThe cyberspace domain is uniquely defined by private sector participation and ownership of the core infrastructure. In this respect, Microsoft\u2019s Digital Geneva Convention is served well by including the private sector but creates a potential contradiction by drawing on the example of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is possible to imagine an independent, member state-funded international organization, like that of the IAEA. Or by empowering the private sector, academia, and civil society is Microsoft suggesting a multistakeholder model? At face value, it appears that governments will set the rules, while private actors will lend their services and data, but nothing is stated about how these interests might be aligned. If a subset of private sector cyber security firms has advanced forensic capability equaling or exceeding that of most states, why would they participate in a monopsony attribution organization? Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs. Alternatively, if access to the internet\u2019s infrastructure allows an investigation to backtrack the origins of an attacker, what process should enable the acquisition of relevant evidence? Should this layer of attribution include partnerships with national law enforcement or permit international inspections? Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cTo the contrary, the WannaCry and NotPetya incidents were followed by attribution efforts coordinated between multiple allied states, and seemingly to a lesser degree, private actors. The coordination of public attribution among the states took place through various means. States that support other states\u2019 attribution results have been mainly subjected to the same cyberattack or are allies of the attributing and attacked countries.6 Some states that have supported US attribution announcements clarify that they have done their own investigation. For example, in the case of WannaCry, New Zealand endorsed the US claims of attribution to the North Korean government, while relying on its own evidence.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 229)", "\u201cAn evaluation of the collected attribution documents, namely Executive Orders (in the United States), criminal complaints, indictments, sanctions, and government statements, reveals that the United States\u2019 current attribution practice is possibly the most elaborate compared to other countries, using various attribution methods and judicial processes. Table 15.3 shows states use the judicial system and forensic technical evidence to carry out the attribution. All the collected indictments (5) are issued by the United States. The US government\u2019s approach is different from other countries when issuing official statements (such as White House Press Secretary announcements). It usually collaborates with the Department of Justice (DoJ); after the DoJ receives the indictment, the Office of Asset Control (OFAC) imposes sanctions on the indicted individuals (US Department of Treasury 2018). While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cThree major challenges are likely to present themselves in institutionalizing transnational attribution; these include geopolitical conflict, building independent capability, and private sector participation. These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence. As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cUntil recently, the US approach to attribution was as follows: The prosecutor gathered technical and circumstantial evidence about the identity of the adversary and as well as their direct or indirect links to the responsible state. Then the prosecutor would file an indictment against the alleged attacker(s) in the federal court, which grants indictments through the grand jury. This process was lengthy, and documents would not be unsealed until many months after the filing of the indictment. The grand jury would then issue the indictment and the Department of Justice would release a statement along with sanctions being imposed on the alleged attackers through OFAC.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cIn an indictment, a grand jury hears evidence and testimony from witnesses presented by the prosecution. It also has the power to subpoena witnesses. But grand jury proceedings are closed to the public and secret, the defense has no opportunity to present evidence or challenge the prosecution evidence. The probable cause standard is one of the lowest in criminal law; only enough evidence that convinces a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed must be established. Once an indictment is issued, there is a very small chance that it will be dismissed. Hence it provides higher certainty in the case of attribution that the charges are based on strong grounds.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cAnother example is the Democratic National Committee incident. In December 2016, the White House and US Dept. of Treasury separately leveled sanctions against five Russian entities (including two Russian intelligence organizations) and six Russian individuals in response to attacks on the Democratic National Committee (Federal Register 2017). They were based in part on a technical report issued by the Dept. of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation that provided many already reported indicators of compromise (e.g., IP addresses, domain names), as well as classified USG intelligence information (US Department of Homeland Security 2016; Office Director of National Intelligence 2017). There was no detail supporting attribution in the White House statement, and the DHS/ FBI report was criticized by a former NSA security expert for failing to provide any evidence of attribution (Lee 2016). In short, the veracity of the attribution suffered, given the absence of publicly available evidence (or explicit linkages to evidence which had already been published by a threat intelligence company). Moreover, while the sanction and indictment processes clearly attributed alleged activities to individuals and organizations, questions remain as to their enforceability and effectiveness as a deterrent.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 229)", "\u201cMoreover, the USG did eventually also file an indictment, publicly attributing espionage activity to individuals affiliated with China\u2019s PLA (US Department of Justice 2014). So, it may be more precise to describe the strategy as one that evolves over time. Tolerance of attacks in the near-term may be explained by Edwards et al.\u2019s logic, but restraint allows the opportunity for sufficient evidence to be marshaled. Perhaps more importantly, the substantially higher number of attributions made by private actors to state sponsors observed in our data suggests that the extent of state\u2019s use of the strategy may be dramatically understated. States may be knowingly refraining from blaming other states far more often and for more reasons than are evident.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 228)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C445.1380140625%2C378.2589999999992%2C453.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C433.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C441.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C421.1380140625%2C377.4699999999993%2C429.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C417.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.1380140625%2C377.40699999999936%2C405.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.1380140625%2C378.2199999999993%2C393.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.1380140625%2C377.46699999999953%2C381.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.1380140625%2C377.69399999999916%2C369.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.1380140625%2C378.2799999999994%2C357.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.1380140625%2C90.64999999999995%2C345.9211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts.

Such a process has not been implemented, nor have current processes been studied in detail.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22230%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 230</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22233%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C421.2104140625%2C378.2099999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.2104140625%2C378.2119999999999%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.2104140625%2C378.2119999999999%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.2104140625%2C378.2099999999999%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.2104140625%2C378.2059999999997%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.2104140625%2C378.21299999999974%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C325.2104140625%2C378.2109999999997%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.20899999999983%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.2069999999998%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C378.2099999999999%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C277.2104140625%2C378.21099999999973%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.22599999999966%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C378.2129999999997%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C229.2104140625%2C378.2039999999997%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C217.2104140625%2C113.99%2C225.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe cyberspace domain is uniquely defined by private sector participation and ownership of the core infrastructure. In this respect, Microsoft\u2019s Digital Geneva Convention is served well by including the private sector but creates a potential contradiction by drawing on the example of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is possible to imagine an independent, member state-funded international organization, like that of the IAEA. Or by empowering the private sector, academia, and civil society is Microsoft suggesting a multistakeholder model? At face value, it appears that governments will set the rules, while private actors will lend their services and data, but nothing is stated about how these interests might be aligned. If a subset of private sector cyber security firms has advanced forensic capability equaling or exceeding that of most states, why would they participate in a monopsony attribution organization? Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs. Alternatively, if access to the internet\u2019s infrastructure allows an investigation to backtrack the origins of an attacker, what process should enable the acquisition of relevant evidence? Should this layer of attribution include partnerships with national law enforcement or permit international inspections? Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C277.2104140625%2C378.21099999999984%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20699999999977%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.21199999999976%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C229.2104140625%2C378.2209999999998%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C217.2104140625%2C378.1993999999999%2C226.56296%5D%2C%5B54%2C205.2104140625%2C378.22199999999975%2C213.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C193.2104140625%2C378.2049999999999%2C201.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C181.2104140625%2C371.4599999999999%2C189.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTo the contrary, the WannaCry and NotPetya incidents were followed by attribution efforts coordinated between multiple allied states, and seemingly to a lesser degree, private actors.

It also has the power to subpoena witnesses. But grand jury proceedings are closed to the public and secret, the defense has no opportunity to present evidence or challenge the prosecution evidence. The probable cause standard is one of the lowest in criminal law; only enough evidence that convinces a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed must be established. Once an indictment is issued, there is a very small chance that it will be dismissed. Hence it provides higher certainty in the case of attribution that the charges are based on strong grounds.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C481.2104140625%2C378.21499999999963%2C489.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C469.2104140625%2C378.2069999999998%2C477.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C457.2104140625%2C378.21099999999973%2C465.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C445.2104140625%2C378.2119999999998%2C453.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C433.2104140625%2C378.20799999999974%2C441.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C421.2104140625%2C378.2109999999998%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.2104140625%2C378.20899999999983%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.2104140625%2C378.2149999999998%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.2104140625%2C378.2059999999999%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.2104140625%2C378.19999999999993%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.2104140625%2C378.20799999999986%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.2104140625%2C378.22099999999966%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.2104140625%2C378.2089999999998%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C325.2104140625%2C378.2209999999997%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.2199999999998%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C208.89%2C297.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAnother example is the Democratic National Committee incident. In December 2016, the White House and US Dept. of Treasury separately leveled sanctions against five Russian entities (including two Russian intelligence organizations) and six Russian individuals in response to attacks on the Democratic National Committee (Federal Register 2017). They were based in part on a technical report issued by the Dept. of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation that provided many already reported indicators of compromise (e.g., IP addresses, domain names), as well as classified USG intelligence information (US Department of Homeland Security 2016; Office Director of National Intelligence 2017). There was no detail supporting attribution in the White House statement, and the DHS/ FBI report was criticized by a former NSA security expert for failing to provide any evidence of attribution (Lee 2016). In short, the veracity of the attribution suffered, given the absence of publicly available evidence (or explicit linkages to evidence which had already been published by a threat intelligence company). Moreover, while the sanction and indictment processes clearly attributed alleged activities to individuals and organizations, questions remain as to their enforceability and effectiveness as a deterrent.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 229</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21299999999957%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2129999999999%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C388.2049999999998%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C277.2104140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C265.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C253.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C241.2104140625%2C388.22099999999966%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C229.2104140625%2C388.2359999999998%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C217.2104140625%2C200.07%2C225.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMoreover, the USG did eventually also file an indictment, publicly attributing espionage activity to individuals affiliated with China\u2019s PLA (US Department of Justice 2014). So, it may be more precise to describe the strategy as one that evolves over time. Tolerance of attacks in the near-term may be explained by Edwards et al.\u2019s logic, but restraint allows the opportunity for sufficient evidence to be marshaled. Perhaps more importantly, the substantially higher number of attributions made by private actors to state sponsors observed in our data suggests that the extent of state\u2019s use of the strategy may be dramatically understated. States may be knowingly refraining from blaming other states far more often and for more reasons than are evident.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

transnational attribution; these include geopolitical conflict, building independent capability, and private sector participation. These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence. As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cIn addition to the geopolitical challenges of managing an organization are those of creating trustworthy assessments. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) manages to maintain global trust in its forensics with an independent laboratory, whose work it supplements with a network of over 20 certified laboratories distributed across numerous national jurisdictions. While the same strategy might help to supplement the capability of an attribution-based organization, building this capability will require financial resources. Finding dedicated financial resources for transnational attribution might create its own challenges. Would a government finance an organization tasked with rooting out its espionage operations, what incentives are there for the private sector, particularly those who sell services to multiple governments?\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cFirst, we provide some background on the role of attribution in deterrence and accountability, and the challenges of attributing, particularly to nation-state actors. We then analyze attributions made from 2016 to 2018. We characterize the actors involved and types of attributions, finding a shift toward private actor attributions and mix of approaches by states. Next, we explore some technical advances in attribution. Better algorithmic-driven attribution, seemingly possible by the collection and analysis of numerous artifacts left on networks by threat actors, could certainly help push attribution forward although it raises issues of how state and non-state actors cooperate. We also look at attempts to understand behavioral aspects of attribution, exploring one game-theoretic attempt to model when states will or will not attribute an attack to another state, and use our dataset to explore certain predictions of the model. This exercise allows us to understand more clearly which state and non-state actors make or avoid making attributions, and the institutional conditions under which their agreement on attribution might occur.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 220)", "\u201cAdversarial geopolitical relationships are likely to extend to any attribution organization. The advantage of such an organization is that by joining it participants agree to adhere to the constitutive as well as procedural rules, even when they disagree over the particulars. Neutrality of international bodies is often established through the professionalism of participants: Either a technical independence as described in the RAND study or a judicial independence might claim to embody this ethos. Should states as political actors be involved, as described by the Atlantic Council proposal, a majoritarian ethos might be needed to result in collective action.

These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) manages to maintain global trust in its forensics with an independent laboratory, whose work it supplements with a network of over 20 certified laboratories distributed across numerous national jurisdictions. While the same strategy might help to supplement the capability of an attribution-based organization, building this capability will require financial resources. Finding dedicated financial resources for transnational attribution might create its own challenges.

We then analyze attributions made from 2016 to 2018. We characterize the actors involved and types of attributions, finding a shift toward private actor attributions and mix of approaches by states. Next, we explore some technical advances in attribution. Better algorithmic-driven attribution, seemingly possible by the collection and analysis of numerous artifacts left on networks by threat actors, could certainly help push attribution forward although it raises issues of how state and non-state actors cooperate. We also look at attempts to understand behavioral aspects of attribution, exploring one game-theoretic attempt to model when states will or will not attribute an attack to another state, and use our dataset to explore certain predictions of the model. This exercise allows us to understand more clearly which state and non-state actors make or avoid making attributions, and the institutional conditions under which their agreement on attribution might occur.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 220</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C133.1380140625%2C388.21999999999963%2C141.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C121.1380140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C129.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C109.1380140625%2C388.2069999999999%2C117.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C97.1380140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C105.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.2059999999997%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAdversarial geopolitical relationships are likely to extend to any attribution organization.

Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs.

As sanctions or other disincentives are used to punish offensive cyber operations, we might expect cyber operations to adjust by taking steps to disguise their identity. The CIA\u2019s leaked Marble Framework, for example, has been described as providing the capability to change the language of the source code from English to another language like Russian or Farsi (Burgess 2017). Meanwhile, cyber tools invented by one country are being reused by another. This suggests a technical race between forensic experts and counter-forensic obfuscation. While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223)", "\u201cThe practice of attribution can be cumulative, grouping information from incidents to create intrusion sets. Intrusion sets are adversarial behaviors, what is sometimes abbreviated as \u201ctactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\u201d, and technical resources with common properties from previous attacks that are grouped together (e.g., a \u201ccampaign\u201d) and associated with a common actor (e.g., a \u201cthreat group\u201d). This process has some general standardization by convention and predictive success, but there is no one correct method. Accordingly, SANS in 2010 noted: There is no rule of thumb or objective threshold to inform when linked intrusions should become a campaign. The best measure is results: if a set of indicators effectively predict similar intrusions when observed in the future, then they have probably been selected properly.

While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C541.1395140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C549.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.1395140625%2C388.20599999999985%2C537.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.1395140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C525.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.1395140625%2C388.1999999999998%2C513.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.1395140625%2C388.2139999999998%2C501.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.1395140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C489.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C469.1395140625%2C388.205%2C477.9226%5D%2C%5B64%2C457.1395140625%2C89%2C465.9226%5D%2C%5B82%2C430.3968140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C439.17990000000003%5D%2C%5B82%2C418.3968140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C427.17990000000003%5D%2C%5B82%2C406.3968140625%2C388.2079999999998%2C415.17990000000003%5D%2C%5B82%2C394.3968140625%2C253.62%2C403.17990000000003%5D%2C%5B324.0494%2C382.3968140625%2C388.2093999999999%2C391.17990000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe practice of attribution can be cumulative, grouping information from incidents to create intrusion sets. Intrusion sets are adversarial behaviors, what is sometimes abbreviated as \u201ctactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\u201d, and technical resources with common properties from previous attacks that are grouped together (e.g., a \u201ccampaign\u201d) and associated with a common actor (e.g., a \u201cthreat group\u201d). This process has some general standardization by convention and predictive success, but there is no one correct method. Accordingly, SANS in 2010 noted: There is no rule of thumb or objective threshold to inform when linked intrusions should become a campaign. The best measure is results: if a set of indicators effectively predict similar intrusions when observed in the future, then they have probably been selected properly.

At present, threat intelligence firms and national security agencies are the primary producers of forensic data and attributions. While reliance on algorithms to cluster observed data and identify infrastructure and adversaries is advancing this introduces socio-technical uncertainties around how data is collected, shared, and analyzed. Coupled with political fragmentation and strategic behavior by states there is need to focus on the institutionalization of credible, independent attribution. While ideal models for making attribution were described, too little is known about the current state of affairs.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts. While governments and threat intelligence groups will attribute attacks to specific intrusion sets, sometimes even linking these to specific actors, there is no internationally recognized forensic process with an evidentiary based level of confidence. Rather, attribution is more often than not based on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity. Considering that both attributing groups and attackers could be based anywhere in the world, without a recognized standardized and institutionalized process for attribution, can we expect a global coalition to implement sanctions or otherwise deter the attacker?\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cWhile their analysis focuses on states, it draws several interesting conclusions which we relate to our dataset. First, Edwards et al. recognize it may be rational for a victim state to tolerate attacks rather than risk escalation through blaming (i.e., attribution), especially when attacks are mild, and no appropriate response is available. Citing the case of Chinese-sponsored economic espionage against US industry, they note the US government\u2019s inability to respond with in-kind attacks and refusal to blame China publicly given the importance of the countries\u2019 broader relationship, instead pursuing diplomacy resulting in the US\u2013China 2015 cyber agreement (US White House 2015). While this strategy apparently worked initially, analysis suggests the underlying intergovernmental negotiation has been unsuccessful in stemming China\u2019s PLA-backed espionage (Segal et al. 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 228)", "\u201cThe work by Chernenko et al. paper presents an interesting contrast to the IAEA model for attribution. While not denying the significance of private sector actors, the Chernenko et al. proposal is explicitly state based, recommending an \u201cindependent, international cyber court ... that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). This scoping is less expansive than the Microsoft proposal, but more inclusive than the Atlantic Council\u2019s, covering government-level cyber conflict which would include those below the threshold of armed conflict.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C553.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C388.20299999999963%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.2100000000001%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.20799999999974%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C388.2099999999997%2C501.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.2104140625%2C388.22399999999993%2C489.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C469.2104140625%2C388.2099999999998%2C477.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C457.2104140625%2C220.33999999999997%2C465.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEach proposal offers different scopes of activity for a cyber attribution organization and pushes for dramatically different structures (e.g., multilateral vs. nongovernmental, or hierarchical vs. networked).

While ideal models for making attribution were described, too little is known about the current state of affairs.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C445.1380140625%2C378.2589999999992%2C453.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C433.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C441.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C421.1380140625%2C377.4699999999993%2C429.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C417.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.1380140625%2C377.40699999999936%2C405.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.1380140625%2C378.2199999999993%2C393.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.1380140625%2C377.46699999999953%2C381.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.1380140625%2C377.69399999999916%2C369.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.1380140625%2C378.2799999999994%2C357.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.1380140625%2C90.64999999999995%2C345.9211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts.

First, Edwards et al. recognize it may be rational for a victim state to tolerate attacks rather than risk escalation through blaming (i.e., attribution), especially when attacks are mild, and no appropriate response is available. Citing the case of Chinese-sponsored economic espionage against US industry, they note the US government\u2019s inability to respond with in-kind attacks and refusal to blame China publicly given the importance of the countries\u2019 broader relationship, instead pursuing diplomacy resulting in the US\u2013China 2015 cyber agreement (US White House 2015). While this strategy apparently worked initially, analysis suggests the underlying intergovernmental negotiation has been unsuccessful in stemming China\u2019s PLA-backed espionage (Segal et al. 2018).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 228</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C109.2104140625%2C378.2239999999997%2C117.99350000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C97.2104140625%2C378.21199999999976%2C105.99350000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C85.2104140625%2C378.2059999999998%2C93.99350000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C73.2104140625%2C378.2219999999998%2C81.99350000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22231%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe work by Chernenko et al. paper presents an interesting contrast to the IAEA model for attribution.

become more complex, relying on more evidence to receive the indictment. However, a \u201ccomplaint\u201d was filed against the alleged perpetrator of WannaCry and not an indictment. A complaint is different in that it is not issued by a grand jury and the prosecutor can decide to file the complaint, naming the individual to be arrested. It should include an affidavit by a prosecutor or a law enforcement official familiar with the case (US Department of Justice 2014, 2018). The prosecutor in the criminal procedure decides to file a complaint if a crime is imminent and it proves \u201cprobable cause\u201d. After the arrest is made based on a criminal complaint, the federal prosecutor must secure an indictment (with a limited amount of time) to proceed with the felony charge(s).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cIn an indictment, a grand jury hears evidence and testimony from witnesses presented by the prosecution. It also has the power to subpoena witnesses. But grand jury proceedings are closed to the public and secret, the defense has no opportunity to present evidence or challenge the prosecution evidence. The probable cause standard is one of the lowest in criminal law; only enough evidence that convinces a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed must be established. Once an indictment is issued, there is a very small chance that it will be dismissed. Hence it provides higher certainty in the case of attribution that the charges are based on strong grounds.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts. While governments and threat intelligence groups will attribute attacks to specific intrusion sets, sometimes even linking these to specific actors, there is no internationally recognized forensic process with an evidentiary based level of confidence. Rather, attribution is more often than not based on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity. Considering that both attributing groups and attackers could be based anywhere in the world, without a recognized standardized and institutionalized process for attribution, can we expect a global coalition to implement sanctions or otherwise deter the attacker?\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cUntil recently, the US approach to attribution was as follows: The prosecutor gathered technical and circumstantial evidence about the identity of the adversary and as well as their direct or indirect links to the responsible state. Then the prosecutor would file an indictment against the alleged attacker(s) in the federal court, which grants indictments through the grand jury. This process was lengthy, and documents would not be unsealed until many months after the filing of the indictment. The grand jury would then issue the indictment and the Department of Justice would release a statement along with sanctions being imposed on the alleged attackers through OFAC.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cBoth technological developments and better understanding of how states act strategically highlight the need for institutionalizing neutral, transnational attribution. At some point, the evidence has to be assessed and independently reviewed, and that cannot be carried out through technological means alone. A decision to blame a responsible party has to take place through a recognized collective attribution process. Such a process has not been implemented, nor have current processes been studied in detail.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 230)", "\u201cThree major challenges are likely to present themselves in institutionalizing transnational attribution; these include geopolitical conflict, building independent capability, and private sector participation. These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence. As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cWithin the private sector and academia, research into attribution has advanced on technological and behavioral fronts. Promising technologies are emerging to significantly improve the forensic confidence in attribution. New areas of research include improved monitoring of infrastructure and application of machine learning to identify anomalous network traffic possibly indicative of adversaries (e.g., Radford et al. 2018). Our colleagues at Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Internet Security & Privacy are also investigating attribution as part of the Rhamnousia project (Toon 2016). The work is sponsored by the United States\u2019 Defense Advanced Research Project Agency\u2019s Enhanced Attribution program, which seeks to \u201cdevelop technologies to associate the malicious actions of cyber adversaries to individual cyber operators and then to enable the government to reveal publicly the malicious actions of individual cyber operators without damaging sources and methods\u201d (DARPA 2018). At a high level, the Rhamnousia project seeks to connect large sets of disparate data artifacts to fuel new algorithmic attribution methods that will expedite the process of attribution. As such, the process of conducting a cyberattack leaves numerous observable data artifacts on adversary-controlled and victims\u2019 networks, as well as on networks in-between. Data includes, but is not limited to, behavioral biometrics from user devices, network traffic, and intrusion detection logs, as well as Domain Name System (DNS) use and registrations (Keromytis 2016).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cAn evaluation of the collected attribution documents, namely Executive Orders (in the United States), criminal complaints, indictments, sanctions, and government statements, reveals that the United States\u2019 current attribution practice is possibly the most elaborate compared to other countries, using various attribution methods and judicial processes. Table 15.3 shows states use the judicial system and forensic technical evidence to carry out the attribution. All the collected indictments (5) are issued by the United States. The US government\u2019s approach is different from other countries when issuing official statements (such as White House Press Secretary announcements). It usually collaborates with the Department of Justice (DoJ); after the DoJ receives the indictment, the Office of Asset Control (OFAC) imposes sanctions on the indicted individuals (US Department of Treasury 2018). While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cAttribution conceptual frameworks help digital forensics to structure collected information and compare it to known intrusion sets. Examples of these include, the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis developed by Caltagirone and Pendergast (2013), and the \u201cQ-model\u201d developed by Rid and Buchanan (2015). Both the Diamond Model and Q-model acknowledge the need for a nontechnical dimension to attribution. In the Diamond Model, the nontechnical dimension is described by the relationship between the victim and adversary. The strategic dimension of the Q-Model is described as a \u201cfunction of what is at stake politically\u201d (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 222)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C601.2104140625%2C388.03399999999954%2C609.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C589.2104140625%2C388.0529999999996%2C597.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C577.2104140625%2C388.0339999999996%2C585.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C565.2104140625%2C387.92499999999967%2C573.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C553.2104140625%2C387.9959999999997%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C387.9869999999995%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.04299999999944%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C387.9769999999994%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.0109999999993%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C388.25999999999954%2C501.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.2104140625%2C132.06999999999994%2C489.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver time, US prosecutors\u2019 filings have become more complex, relying on more evidence to receive the indictment.

It should include an affidavit by a prosecutor or a law enforcement official familiar with the case (US Department of Justice 2014, 2018). The prosecutor in the criminal procedure decides to file a complaint if a crime is imminent and it proves \u201cprobable cause\u201d.

It also has the power to subpoena witnesses. But grand jury proceedings are closed to the public and secret, the defense has no opportunity to present evidence or challenge the prosecution evidence. The probable cause standard is one of the lowest in criminal law; only enough evidence that convinces a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed must be established. Once an indictment is issued, there is a very small chance that it will be dismissed.

As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C529.1380140625%2C378.21599999999967%2C537.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C517.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C525.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C505.1380140625%2C378.20899999999995%2C513.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C493.1380140625%2C378.20599999999985%2C501.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C481.1380140625%2C378.20599999999973%2C489.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C469.1380140625%2C378.2159999999998%2C477.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C457.1380140625%2C378.21599999999967%2C465.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C445.1380140625%2C378.20899999999983%2C453.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C433.1380140625%2C378.2089999999997%2C441.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C421.1380140625%2C378.20899999999966%2C429.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.1380140625%2C378.21999999999997%2C417.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C405.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.1380140625%2C378.2099999999999%2C393.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C381.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.1380140625%2C378.21099999999973%2C369.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.1380140625%2C378.20199999999977%2C357.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.1380140625%2C378.21299999999985%2C345.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C325.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C333.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.1380140625%2C378.2039999999999%2C321.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.1380140625%2C212.59%2C309.9211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWithin the private sector and academia, research into attribution has advanced on technological and behavioral fronts. Promising technologies are emerging to significantly improve the forensic confidence in attribution. New areas of research include improved monitoring of infrastructure and application of machine learning to identify anomalous network traffic possibly indicative of adversaries (e.g., Radford et al. 2018). Our colleagues at Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Internet Security &amp; Privacy are also investigating attribution as part of the Rhamnousia project (Toon 2016). The work is sponsored by the United States\u2019 Defense Advanced Research Project Agency\u2019s Enhanced Attribution program, which seeks to \u201cdevelop technologies to associate the malicious actions of cyber adversaries to individual cyber operators and then to enable the government to reveal publicly the malicious actions of individual cyber operators without damaging sources and methods\u201d (DARPA 2018). At a high level, the Rhamnousia project seeks to connect large sets of disparate data artifacts to fuel new algorithmic attribution methods that will expedite the process of attribution. As such, the process of conducting a cyberattack leaves numerous observable data artifacts on adversary-controlled and victims\u2019 networks, as well as on networks in-between. Data includes, but is not limited to, behavioral biometrics from user devices, network traffic, and intrusion detection logs, as well as Domain Name System (DNS) use and registrations (Keromytis 2016).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C241.2104140625%2C389.1529999999994%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C229.2104140625%2C389.1559999999994%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C217.2104140625%2C389.25499999999914%2C225.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C205.2104140625%2C389.2489999999993%2C213.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C193.2104140625%2C388.18909999999903%2C201.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAn evaluation of the collected attribution documents, namely Executive Orders (in the United States), criminal complaints, indictments, sanctions, and government statements, reveals that the United States\u2019 current attribution practice is possibly the most elaborate compared to other countries, using various attribution methods and judicial processes.

All the collected indictments (5) are issued by the United States. The US government\u2019s approach is different from other countries when issuing official statements (such as White House Press Secretary announcements). It usually collaborates with the Department of Justice (DoJ); after the DoJ receives the indictment, the Office of Asset Control (OFAC) imposes sanctions on the indicted individuals (US Department of Treasury 2018). While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C235.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C244.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C223.6541140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C232.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C211.6541140625%2C388.1999999999999%2C220.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C199.6541140625%2C388.20599999999996%2C208.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C187.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C196.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C175.6541140625%2C388.21299999999974%2C184.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C163.6541140625%2C388.2099999999998%2C172.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C151.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C160.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C139.6541140625%2C195.92%2C148.43720000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution conceptual frameworks help digital forensics to structure collected information and compare it to known intrusion sets.

However, a \u201ccomplaint\u201d was filed against the alleged perpetrator of WannaCry and not an indictment. A complaint is different in that it is not issued by a grand jury and the prosecutor can decide to file the complaint, naming the individual to be arrested. It should include an affidavit by a prosecutor or a law enforcement official familiar with the case (US Department of Justice 2014, 2018). The prosecutor in the criminal procedure decides to file a complaint if a crime is imminent and it proves \u201cprobable cause\u201d. After the arrest is made based on a criminal complaint, the federal prosecutor must secure an indictment (with a limited amount of time) to proceed with the felony charge(s).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cBoth technological developments and better understanding of how states act strategically highlight the need for institutionalizing neutral, transnational attribution. At some point, the evidence has to be assessed and independently reviewed, and that cannot be carried out through technological means alone. A decision to blame a responsible party has to take place through a recognized collective attribution process. Such a process has not been implemented, nor have current processes been studied in detail.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 230)", "\u201cIn an indictment, a grand jury hears evidence and testimony from witnesses presented by the prosecution. It also has the power to subpoena witnesses. But grand jury proceedings are closed to the public and secret, the defense has no opportunity to present evidence or challenge the prosecution evidence. The probable cause standard is one of the lowest in criminal law; only enough evidence that convinces a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed must be established. Once an indictment is issued, there is a very small chance that it will be dismissed. Hence it provides higher certainty in the case of attribution that the charges are based on strong grounds.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cAn evaluation of the collected attribution documents, namely Executive Orders (in the United States), criminal complaints, indictments, sanctions, and government statements, reveals that the United States\u2019 current attribution practice is possibly the most elaborate compared to other countries, using various attribution methods and judicial processes. Table 15.3 shows states use the judicial system and forensic technical evidence to carry out the attribution. All the collected indictments (5) are issued by the United States. The US government\u2019s approach is different from other countries when issuing official statements (such as White House Press Secretary announcements). It usually collaborates with the Department of Justice (DoJ); after the DoJ receives the indictment, the Office of Asset Control (OFAC) imposes sanctions on the indicted individuals (US Department of Treasury 2018). While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cUntil recently, the US approach to attribution was as follows: The prosecutor gathered technical and circumstantial evidence about the identity of the adversary and as well as their direct or indirect links to the responsible state. Then the prosecutor would file an indictment against the alleged attacker(s) in the federal court, which grants indictments through the grand jury. This process was lengthy, and documents would not be unsealed until many months after the filing of the indictment. The grand jury would then issue the indictment and the Department of Justice would release a statement along with sanctions being imposed on the alleged attackers through OFAC.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cThree major challenges are likely to present themselves in institutionalizing transnational attribution; these include geopolitical conflict, building independent capability, and private sector participation. These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence. As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts. While governments and threat intelligence groups will attribute attacks to specific intrusion sets, sometimes even linking these to specific actors, there is no internationally recognized forensic process with an evidentiary based level of confidence. Rather, attribution is more often than not based on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity. Considering that both attributing groups and attackers could be based anywhere in the world, without a recognized standardized and institutionalized process for attribution, can we expect a global coalition to implement sanctions or otherwise deter the attacker?\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cMoreover, the USG did eventually also file an indictment, publicly attributing espionage activity to individuals affiliated with China\u2019s PLA (US Department of Justice 2014). So, it may be more precise to describe the strategy as one that evolves over time. Tolerance of attacks in the near-term may be explained by Edwards et al.\u2019s logic, but restraint allows the opportunity for sufficient evidence to be marshaled. Perhaps more importantly, the substantially higher number of attributions made by private actors to state sponsors observed in our data suggests that the extent of state\u2019s use of the strategy may be dramatically understated. States may be knowingly refraining from blaming other states far more often and for more reasons than are evident.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 228)", "\u201cTo the contrary, the WannaCry and NotPetya incidents were followed by attribution efforts coordinated between multiple allied states, and seemingly to a lesser degree, private actors. The coordination of public attribution among the states took place through various means. States that support other states\u2019 attribution results have been mainly subjected to the same cyberattack or are allies of the attributing and attacked countries.6 Some states that have supported US attribution announcements clarify that they have done their own investigation. For example, in the case of WannaCry, New Zealand endorsed the US claims of attribution to the North Korean government, while relying on its own evidence.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 229)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C601.2104140625%2C388.03399999999954%2C609.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C589.2104140625%2C388.0529999999996%2C597.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C577.2104140625%2C388.0339999999996%2C585.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C565.2104140625%2C387.92499999999967%2C573.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C553.2104140625%2C387.9959999999997%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C387.9869999999995%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.04299999999944%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C387.9769999999994%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.0109999999993%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C388.25999999999954%2C501.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.2104140625%2C132.06999999999994%2C489.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver time, US prosecutors\u2019 filings have become more complex, relying on more evidence to receive the indictment.

While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C170.1380140625%2C378.2139999999998%2C178.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C158.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C166.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C146.1380140625%2C378.20399999999984%2C154.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C134.1380140625%2C378.21099999999973%2C142.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C122.1380140625%2C378.2119999999998%2C130.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C110.1380140625%2C378.2089999999997%2C118.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C98.1380140625%2C378.2129999999998%2C106.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C86.1380140625%2C378.2109999999998%2C94.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C74.1380140625%2C186.2%2C82.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cUntil recently, the US approach to attribution was as follows: The prosecutor gathered technical and circumstantial evidence about the identity of the adversary and as well as their direct or indirect links to the responsible state. Then the prosecutor would file an indictment against the alleged attacker(s) in the federal court, which grants indictments through the grand jury. This process was lengthy, and documents would not be unsealed until many months after the filing of the indictment. The grand jury would then issue the indictment and the Department of Justice would release a statement along with sanctions being imposed on the alleged attackers through OFAC.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C241.1380140625%2C388.2209999999996%2C249.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C229.1380140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C237.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C217.1380140625%2C388.20599999999985%2C225.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C205.1380140625%2C388.21199999999993%2C213.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C193.1380140625%2C388.21799999999985%2C201.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C181.1380140625%2C388.23599999999976%2C189.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C169.1380140625%2C388.2159999999997%2C177.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C157.1380140625%2C388.20699999999977%2C165.9211%5D%2C%5B64%2C145.1380140625%2C111.75999999999999%2C153.9211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThree major challenges are likely to present themselves in institutionalizing transnational attribution; these include geopolitical conflict, building independent capability, and private sector participation. These challenges overlap with, but are more institutional than, the challenges identified by the RAND study: Effective attribution and persuasive communication. Efficacy and communication will be contingent on the breadth of participation of public and private entities and their willingness to be transparent with the evidence. As with any political challenge, getting collective action from actors with competing interests presents a challenge.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C445.1380140625%2C378.2589999999992%2C453.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C433.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C441.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C421.1380140625%2C377.4699999999993%2C429.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.1380140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C417.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.1380140625%2C377.40699999999936%2C405.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.1380140625%2C378.2199999999993%2C393.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.1380140625%2C377.46699999999953%2C381.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.1380140625%2C377.69399999999916%2C369.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.1380140625%2C378.2799999999994%2C357.9211%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.1380140625%2C90.64999999999995%2C345.9211%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAccurate attribution requires experienced threat intelligence and digital forensics experts. While governments and threat intelligence groups will attribute attacks to specific intrusion sets, sometimes even linking these to specific actors, there is no internationally recognized forensic process with an evidentiary based level of confidence. Rather, attribution is more often than not based on limited evidence and the reputation of the attributing entity. Considering that both attributing groups and attackers could be based anywhere in the world, without a recognized standardized and institutionalized process for attribution, can we expect a global coalition to implement sanctions or otherwise deter the attacker?\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21299999999957%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2129999999999%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C388.2049999999998%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C277.2104140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C265.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C253.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C241.2104140625%2C388.22099999999966%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C229.2104140625%2C388.2359999999998%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C217.2104140625%2C200.07%2C225.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMoreover, the USG did eventually also file an indictment, publicly attributing espionage activity to individuals affiliated with China\u2019s PLA (US Department of Justice 2014). So, it may be more precise to describe the strategy as one that evolves over time. Tolerance of attacks in the near-term may be explained by Edwards et al.\u2019s logic, but restraint allows the opportunity for sufficient evidence to be marshaled. Perhaps more importantly, the substantially higher number of attributions made by private actors to state sponsors observed in our data suggests that the extent of state\u2019s use of the strategy may be dramatically understated. States may be knowingly refraining from blaming other states far more often and for more reasons than are evident.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 228</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C277.2104140625%2C378.21099999999984%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20699999999977%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.21199999999976%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C229.2104140625%2C378.2209999999998%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C217.2104140625%2C378.1993999999999%2C226.56296%5D%2C%5B54%2C205.2104140625%2C378.22199999999975%2C213.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C193.2104140625%2C378.2049999999999%2C201.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C181.2104140625%2C371.4599999999999%2C189.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTo the contrary, the WannaCry and NotPetya incidents were followed by attribution efforts coordinated between multiple allied states, and seemingly to a lesser degree, private actors.

evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions. It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cThere is an important distinction between identifying intrusion sets and assigning them to an adversary or \u201cthreat group\u201d on the one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting.

After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C109.1380140625%2C388.20799999999963%2C117.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C97.1380140625%2C388.21599999999955%2C105.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.21000000000004%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors.

circumstantial evidence about the identity of the adversary and as well as their direct or indirect links to the responsible state. Then the prosecutor would file an indictment against the alleged attacker(s) in the federal court, which grants indictments through the grand jury. This process was lengthy, and documents would not be unsealed until many months after the filing of the indictment. The grand jury would then issue the indictment and the Department of Justice would release a statement along with sanctions being imposed on the alleged attackers through OFAC.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cMoreover, the USG did eventually also file an indictment, publicly attributing espionage activity to individuals affiliated with China\u2019s PLA (US Department of Justice 2014). So, it may be more precise to describe the strategy as one that evolves over time.

Table 15.3 shows states use the judicial system and forensic technical evidence to carry out the attribution. All the collected indictments (5) are issued by the United States. The US government\u2019s approach is different from other countries when issuing official statements (such as White House Press Secretary announcements). It usually collaborates with the Department of Justice (DoJ); after the DoJ receives the indictment, the Office of Asset Control (OFAC) imposes sanctions on the indicted individuals (US Department of Treasury 2018). While other countries such as New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada have special agencies that might get involved with attribution, the outcome of attribution is usually announced by government agencies and ministries and no national court is involved in charging the attackers.4\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 225)", "\u201cThe cyberspace domain is uniquely defined by private sector participation and ownership of the core infrastructure.

A complaint is different in that it is not issued by a grand jury and the prosecutor can decide to file the complaint, naming the individual to be arrested. It should include an affidavit by a prosecutor or a law enforcement official familiar with the case (US Department of Justice 2014, 2018). The prosecutor in the criminal procedure decides to file a complaint if a crime is imminent and it proves \u201cprobable cause\u201d.

Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C601.2104140625%2C388.03399999999954%2C609.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C589.2104140625%2C388.0529999999996%2C597.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C577.2104140625%2C388.0339999999996%2C585.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C565.2104140625%2C387.92499999999967%2C573.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C553.2104140625%2C387.9959999999997%2C561.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C541.2104140625%2C387.9869999999995%2C549.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C529.2104140625%2C388.04299999999944%2C537.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C517.2104140625%2C387.9769999999994%2C525.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C505.2104140625%2C388.0109999999993%2C513.9934999999999%5D%2C%5B64%2C493.2104140625%2C388.25999999999954%2C501.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C481.2104140625%2C132.06999999999994%2C489.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver time, US prosecutors\u2019 filings have become more complex, relying on more evidence to receive the indictment. However, a \u201ccomplaint\u201d was filed against the alleged perpetrator of WannaCry and not an indictment. A complaint is different in that it is not issued by a grand jury and the prosecutor can decide to file the complaint, naming the individual to be arrested. It should include an affidavit by a prosecutor or a law enforcement official familiar with the case (US Department of Justice 2014, 2018). The prosecutor in the criminal procedure decides to file a complaint if a crime is imminent and it proves \u201cprobable cause\u201d. After the arrest is made based on a criminal complaint, the federal prosecutor must secure an indictment (with a limited amount of time) to proceed with the felony charge(s).\u201d</span> <span

\u201cthreat group\u201d on the one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cA transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions. It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting.

After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C325.2104140625%2C378.20819999999986%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.20799999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C378.20799999999963%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C277.2104140625%2C378.2069999999995%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20999999999987%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.2079999999998%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C203.40000000000003%2C249.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22231%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014).

group\u201d on the one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cA transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions. It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting.

one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack.

Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018).

Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&amp;C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C445.2104140625%2C388.21399999999966%2C453.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C433.2104140625%2C388.20099999999974%2C441.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C421.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C409.2104140625%2C388.20599999999973%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C397.2104140625%2C388.2189999999998%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C385.2104140625%2C388.2089999999997%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C373.2104140625%2C388.21699999999987%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C361.2104140625%2C388.20999999999987%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C349.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C337.2104140625%2C388.2119999999998%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21099999999973%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2149999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C340.6217999999999%2C297.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C109.1380140625%2C388.20799999999963%2C117.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C97.1380140625%2C388.21599999999955%2C105.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.21000000000004%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors.

hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting. (National Cyber Security Center of New Zealand 2016)\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 226)", "\u201cA transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions.

After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C109.1380140625%2C388.20799999999963%2C117.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C97.1380140625%2C388.21599999999955%2C105.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.21000000000004%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors.

participation and ownership of the core infrastructure. In this respect, Microsoft\u2019s Digital Geneva Convention is served well by including the private sector but creates a potential contradiction by drawing on the example of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is possible to imagine an independent, member state-funded international organization, like that of the IAEA. Or by empowering the private sector, academia, and civil society is Microsoft suggesting a multistakeholder model? At face value, it appears that governments will set the rules, while private actors will lend their services and data, but nothing is stated about how these interests might be aligned. If a subset of private sector cyber security firms has advanced forensic capability equaling or exceeding that of most states, why would they participate in a monopsony attribution organization? Presumably, benefits to them would need to outweigh costs. Alternatively, if access to the internet\u2019s infrastructure allows an investigation to backtrack the origins of an attacker, what process should enable the acquisition of relevant evidence? Should this layer of attribution include partnerships with national law enforcement or permit international inspections? Either way, this potentially burdens the private sector and has implications for global privacy.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)", "\u201cThere is an important distinction between identifying intrusion sets and assigning them to an adversary or \u201cthreat group\u201d on the one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cAdversarial geopolitical relationships are likely to extend to any attribution organization. The advantage of such an organization is that by joining it participants agree to adhere to the constitutive as well as procedural rules, even when they disagree over the particulars. Neutrality of international bodies is often established through the professionalism of participants: Either a technical independence as described in the RAND study or a judicial independence might claim to embody this ethos. Should states as political actors be involved, as described by the Atlantic Council proposal, a majoritarian ethos might be needed to result in collective action. A consensus-based solution proposed in the Microsoft Digital Geneva Convention research could certainly face challenges acquiring unanimity.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 233)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22233%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C421.2104140625%2C378.2099999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C409.2104140625%2C378.2119999999999%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C397.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C385.2104140625%2C378.2119999999999%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C373.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C361.2104140625%2C378.2099999999999%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C349.2104140625%2C378.2059999999997%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C337.2104140625%2C378.21299999999974%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C325.2104140625%2C378.2109999999997%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.20899999999983%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.2069999999998%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C378.2099999999999%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C277.2104140625%2C378.21099999999973%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.22599999999966%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C378.2129999999997%2C249.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C229.2104140625%2C378.2039999999997%2C237.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C217.2104140625%2C113.99%2C225.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22233%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe cyberspace domain is uniquely defined by private sector participation and ownership of the core infrastructure.

\u201cthreat group\u201d on the one hand and linking this adversary with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014). While the scope is only limited to incidents that rise above an international legal threshold, Healey et al. suggest that these assessments should result in the application of an enforcement mechanism. The organization, like the Digital Geneva Convention draws on the IAEA for inspiration, but also the Biological Weapons Convention and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cA transnational attribution institution could serve as a neutral global platform to evaluate and perform authoritative public attributions. It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies. New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is a government center that has been involved with attribution, and its most common target of attribution is to states: The NCSC\u2019s most common form of attribution occurs when an incident is detected or discovered that contains indicators or technical artefacts previously associated with a state-sponsored actor. These indicators and artefacts come from numerous sources including the NCSC\u2019s own analysis and partner and open source reporting.

Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&amp;C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C445.2104140625%2C388.21399999999966%2C453.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C433.2104140625%2C388.20099999999974%2C441.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C421.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C409.2104140625%2C388.20599999999973%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C397.2104140625%2C388.2189999999998%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C385.2104140625%2C388.2089999999997%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C373.2104140625%2C388.21699999999987%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C361.2104140625%2C388.20999999999987%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C349.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C337.2104140625%2C388.2119999999998%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21099999999973%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2149999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C340.6217999999999%2C297.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C325.2104140625%2C378.20819999999986%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.20799999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C378.20799999999963%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C277.2104140625%2C378.2069999999995%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20999999999987%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.2079999999998%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C203.40000000000003%2C249.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22231%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014).

A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22231%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C265.1862140625%2C388.2179999999997%2C273.96930000000003%5D%2C%5B64%2C253.1862140625%2C388.2119999999999%2C261.9693%5D%2C%5B64%2C241.1862140625%2C388.2139999999999%2C249.9693%5D%2C%5B64%2C229.1862140625%2C388.2139999999998%2C237.9693%5D%2C%5B64%2C217.1862140625%2C381.50999999999954%2C225.9693%5D%2C%5B82%2C193.1621140625%2C388.21399999999977%2C201.9452%5D%2C%5B82%2C181.1621140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C189.9452%5D%2C%5B82%2C169.1621140625%2C388.21599999999967%2C177.9452%5D%2C%5B82%2C157.1621140625%2C388.2169999999998%2C165.9452%5D%2C%5B82%2C145.1621140625%2C188.64000000000001%2C153.9452%5D%2C%5B165.778%2C133.1621140625%2C388.22799999999995%2C141.9452%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies.

with a known state or non-state actor on the other. Robert Lee refers to the latter as \u201ctrue attribution\u201d (Lee 2016). This two-part distinction can be compared to Herb Lin\u2019s model, developed in the article \u201cAttribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents\u201d, which uses three levels of attribution: Machines, human operators, and the ultimate party responsible (Lin 2016). In Mandiant\u2019s 2013 attribution of an Advanced Persistent Threat (i.e., \u201cAPT-1\u201d) to the China PLA Unit 612398 all three levels of Lin\u2019s model are described (Wittes 2013). At the lowest level would be IP addresses associated with command and control (C&C) servers. Next, is attribution to a human operator; the Mandiant report identifies a persona who went by the alias \u201cugly gorilla\u201d, but associated this with the real person, Wang Dong. Ultimately though, the report is attributing APT-1 to China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army and hence the Chinese state.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 221)", "\u201cWhile the political dimension of attribution might be quantified, it is necessarily relational, a product more of political science or intelligence studies than computer science. As sanctions or other disincentives are used to punish offensive cyber operations, we might expect cyber operations to adjust by taking steps to disguise their identity. The CIA\u2019s leaked Marble Framework, for example, has been described as providing the capability to change the language of the source code from English to another language like Russian or Farsi (Burgess 2017). Meanwhile, cyber tools invented by one country are being reused by another. This suggests a technical race between forensic experts and counter-forensic obfuscation. While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223)", "\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232)", "\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors. It issues technical alerts in collaboration with other countries\u2019 government agencies, for example the US DHS and FBI in the case of NotPetya (UK National Cyber Security Centre 2018), as well as the assessment of whether a state actor has been involved with a cyberattack. The UK Foreign Office minister relies on those assessments to issue statements condemning such cyberattacks (UK Foreign Office 2018).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cCountries other than the United States also attribute cyberattacks to nation states, either by supporting another state\u2019s statement or action or by carrying out their own cyber attribution through their national cyber security agencies.

Meanwhile, cyber tools invented by one country are being reused by another. This suggests a technical race between forensic experts and counter-forensic obfuscation. While obfuscation might serve powerful states well in the short term, it does little to mitigate the long-term damage of offensive cyberattacks. There is also the inequity of state attribution capability. This is said to have played a role in the breakdown of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE) (Schmitt and Vihul 2017).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 223</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22232%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C445.2104140625%2C388.21399999999966%2C453.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C433.2104140625%2C388.20099999999974%2C441.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C421.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C429.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C409.2104140625%2C388.20599999999973%2C417.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C397.2104140625%2C388.2189999999998%2C405.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C385.2104140625%2C388.2089999999997%2C393.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C373.2104140625%2C388.21699999999987%2C381.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C361.2104140625%2C388.20999999999987%2C369.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C349.2104140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C357.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C337.2104140625%2C388.2119999999998%2C345.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C325.2104140625%2C388.21099999999973%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C313.2104140625%2C388.2149999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C301.2104140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B64%2C289.2104140625%2C340.6217999999999%2C297.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOver the past two years, a handful of organizations, including the Internet Governance Project (with which the authors are affiliated) and Swiss-based ICT4Peace, have built upon the ideas presented in both Microsoft and RAND proposals. After socializing the idea of transnational, independent cyber attribution in fora like RightsCon, the UN Internet Governance Forum and the North American Network Operators Group, an initial workshop bringing together universitybased and independent researchers took place in May 2020 (Internet Governance Project 2018). Together the workshop participants continue to develop a global network of researchers based in academia, civil society, and business who want to cooperate to develop attribution capabilities that are considered scientific and credible by the broader community. If successful, this could effectively counter state-sponsored or state-affiliated cyberattacks and the strategic use of attribution, and complement other efforts like the CyberPeace Institute (https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/) to build and enforce cyber norms through accountability.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22232%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 232</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64%2C109.1380140625%2C388.20799999999963%2C117.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C97.1380140625%2C388.21599999999955%2C105.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C85.1380140625%2C388.21000000000004%2C93.92110000000001%5D%2C%5B64%2C73.1380140625%2C388.2109999999998%2C81.92110000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) similarly gets involved with attributing cyber-attacks to states actors.

It would be an independent entity or set of processes whose attribution decisions would aspire to be widely perceived as unbiased, legitimate, and valid, even among parties who might be antagonistic (such as rival nation-states). Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018). A more recent initiative builds on two of these proposals.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cThe International Attribution Organization proposed is one such proposal that has been widely touted in the Microsoft Digital Geneva Convention, and in its subsequent articulation (see Charney 2016, also Charney et al. 2016), This proposal included language that suggested that an independent attribution organization should (1) span the public and private sectors while including civil society and academia, (2) both investigate and serve an information sharing role, and (3) resemble the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The initial proposal contained significant ambiguity as to whether or not this is describing a multistakeholder or multilateral model.\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 231)", "\u201cWithin the private sector and academia, research into attribution has advanced on technological and behavioral fronts. Promising technologies are emerging to significantly improve the forensic confidence in attribution. New areas of research include improved monitoring of infrastructure and application of machine learning to identify anomalous network traffic possibly indicative of adversaries (e.g., Radford et al. 2018). Our colleagues at Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Internet Security & Privacy are also investigating attribution as part of the Rhamnousia project (Toon 2016). The work is sponsored by the United States\u2019 Defense Advanced Research Project Agency\u2019s Enhanced Attribution program, which seeks to \u201cdevelop technologies to associate the malicious actions of cyber adversaries to individual cyber operators and then to enable the government to reveal publicly the malicious actions of individual cyber operators without damaging sources and methods\u201d (DARPA 2018). At a high level, the Rhamnousia project seeks to connect large sets of disparate data artifacts to fuel new algorithmic attribution methods that will expedite the process of attribution. As such, the process of conducting a cyberattack leaves numerous observable data artifacts on adversary-controlled and victims\u2019 networks, as well as on networks in-between. Data includes, but is not limited to, behavioral biometrics from user devices, network traffic, and intrusion detection logs, as well as Domain Name System (DNS) use and registrations (Keromytis 2016).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227)", "\u201cAttribution conceptual frameworks help digital forensics to structure collected information and compare it to known intrusion sets. Examples of these include, the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis developed by Caltagirone and Pendergast (2013), and the \u201cQ-model\u201d developed by Rid and Buchanan (2015). Both the Diamond Model and Q-model acknowledge the need for a nontechnical dimension to attribution. In the Diamond Model, the nontechnical dimension is described by the relationship between the victim and adversary. The strategic dimension of the Q-Model is described as a \u201cfunction of what is at stake politically\u201d (Rid and Buchanan 2015).\u201d (Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 222)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B66%2C325.2104140625%2C378.20819999999986%2C333.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C313.2104140625%2C378.20459999999997%2C321.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C301.2104140625%2C378.20799999999997%2C309.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C289.2104140625%2C378.20799999999963%2C297.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C277.2104140625%2C378.2069999999995%2C285.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C265.2104140625%2C378.20999999999987%2C273.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C253.2104140625%2C378.2079999999998%2C261.9935%5D%2C%5B54%2C241.2104140625%2C203.40000000000003%2C249.9935%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22231%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Atlantic Council\u2019s 2014 Confidence Building Measures in Cyberspace report proposes a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyberattacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014).

Various proposals have been put forward with different scopes of activity, organizational structures, levels of stakeholder involvement, and evidentiary standards to potentially achieve such a process. Four of the leading attribution proposals have markedly different descriptions. Microsoft describes their proposal as \u201ca public-private forum to address attribution\u201d (Charney 2016); the Atlantic Council called for a multilateral \u201cattribution and adjudication council for cyber-attacks rising to the [legal] level of \u2018armed conflict\u2019\u201d (Healy et al. 2014); a RAND study called for a \u201cGlobal Cyber Attribution Consortium\u201d of non-state actors (Davies et al. 2017); a Russian think tank called for an \u201cindependent, international cyber court or arbitrage method that deals only with government-level cyber conflicts\u201d (Chernenko et al. 2018).

Promising technologies are emerging to significantly improve the forensic confidence in attribution. New areas of research include improved monitoring of infrastructure and application of machine learning to identify anomalous network traffic possibly indicative of adversaries (e.g., Radford et al. 2018). Our colleagues at Georgia Tech\u2019s Institute for Internet Security &amp; Privacy are also investigating attribution as part of the Rhamnousia project (Toon 2016). The work is sponsored by the United States\u2019 Defense Advanced Research Project Agency\u2019s Enhanced Attribution program, which seeks to \u201cdevelop technologies to associate the malicious actions of cyber adversaries to individual cyber operators and then to enable the government to reveal publicly the malicious actions of individual cyber operators without damaging sources and methods\u201d (DARPA 2018). At a high level, the Rhamnousia project seeks to connect large sets of disparate data artifacts to fuel new algorithmic attribution methods that will expedite the process of attribution. As such, the process of conducting a cyberattack leaves numerous observable data artifacts on adversary-controlled and victims\u2019 networks, as well as on networks in-between. Data includes, but is not limited to, behavioral biometrics from user devices, network traffic, and intrusion detection logs, as well as Domain Name System (DNS) use and registrations (Keromytis 2016).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kuerbis et al., 2022, p. 227</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZML4HIH5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C235.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C244.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C223.6541140625%2C388.21199999999976%2C232.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C211.6541140625%2C388.1999999999999%2C220.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C199.6541140625%2C388.20599999999996%2C208.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C187.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C196.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C175.6541140625%2C388.21299999999974%2C184.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C163.6541140625%2C388.2099999999998%2C172.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C151.6541140625%2C388.20459999999997%2C160.43720000000002%5D%2C%5B64%2C139.6541140625%2C195.92%2C148.43720000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMAQNU48R%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution conceptual frameworks help digital forensics to structure collected information and compare it to known intrusion sets.
