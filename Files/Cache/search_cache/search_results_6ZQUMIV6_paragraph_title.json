For example, a state can deny responsibility for exploitation of vulnerabilities even if the victim state can use forensic techniques to ascertain the origin of the act. Denial is possible because of the infrastructure of cyberspace, which allows cyber operators to conduct cyber operations in relative anonymity. Technology allows cyber perpetrators to mask their identity and make identification of the act, actor, and any state sponsor, very difficult.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 1)", "\u201cMoreover, these additional factors and considerations can assist victim states in determining whether or not a cyber act is committed by a non-state actor under the control of a perpetrating state. This analysis is crucial in the establishment of an armed attack or an international armed conflict executed through an organized armed group of non-state actors. Without the inclusion of these factors and considerations, a victim state is limited in its ability to respond to a violation of its sovereignty. Since the thresholds under international law are high, not definitively set forth, and technology is limited in its assessment of the originator of an act, non-technical collection of human factors should be considered relevant circumstantial evidence in proving a victim state\u2019s case in an international forum, for attributing the cyber act or acts to a perpetrating state.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 21)", "\u201cNature of Cyberspace. Cyberspace creates an environment that provides global benefits yet simultaneously exploits vulnerabilities anonymously through a simple keystroke.116 The environment of cyberspace proposes vulnerabilities to a state\u2019s national security because of the connections that exist in all facets of the infrastructure. For example, in modern society, the dependence of Internet connectivity is illustrated through the interconnectivity of financial institutions, transportation, power, and other important infrastructures.117 Since cyberspace is interconnected, there will always be a risk of affecting other states and its citizens because of any action or response to cyber acts.118\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 13)", "\u201cThe additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process. Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act. The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court. As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible. The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201cThe United States works with the international community to apply existing international laws and the principles of the law of war to cyber operations.15 Specific international laws may apply to cyber operations even though the laws were created before cyberspace became a domain.16 Therefore, terminology as it relates to cyberspace continues to develop.17 However, there are certain terms that require definitions that relate specifically to cyber operations to understand the context better and threshold required for responses. For example, the term cyberattack has been used to describe \u201chostile or malicious cyber activities, such as the defacement of websites, network intrusions, the theft of private information, or the disruption of the provision of Internet services.\u201d18 When applying principles of the law of war, these types of cyber activities, though hostile or malicious in nature, do not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack\u201d or allow for a state to declare a response in self-defense under international law.19 Therefore, for the purposes of this paper, the definition for cyberattacks under Joint Publication 3-12 will be used. Joint Publication 3-12 defines cyberattacks as \u201ccyberspace actions that create various direct denial effects in cyberspace (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) and manipulation that leads to denial that is hidden or that manifests in the physical domains.\u201d20 Defining cyber acts as cyberattacks versus other activities, such as cyber exploitations, is important because of the distinction made under international law and the threshold required to meet this definition. Though similar, cyber exploitations are acts directed at retrieving information whereas cyberattacks are acts directed at \u201cdisrupting or destroying\u201d a physical system.21\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cLOAC distinguishes between international armed conflict between states and non-international conflict between a state and non-state actors, such as an organized group.102 Attribution in these cases is critical because of the ability of victim states to respond with the use of force against the state or nonstate actors. Additionally, attribution is critical because, if the support of nonstate actors by a perpetrating state can be established and meet the elements of proof that make the act attributable to the perpetrating state, then the cyber act can rise to the level of international conflict under LOAC.103 Further, evidence that other states supported non-state actors in another territory in the pursuit of a cyber act that meets the threshold of an armed attack can \u201cinternationalize\u201d a conflict that was considered a non-international armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.104 Support of other states is legally significant because the rules under international law then apply to an armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.105\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cIn an interview with Maj Zachary Smith\u2014 deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Divisionhe indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can fit into one of these threat categories, but attribution is the most significant in the case of warfare because of the implications under international law and a victim state\u2019s ability to appropriately respond.169\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cAdditional Considerations. Though human factors are an essential part of the attribution process, other variables are also important in considering a multi-dimensional approach. Other considerations in addition to the type of cyber activity and actors involved are the risk associated with the act and the speed in which attribution can be accomplished.180 According to Dr. Richard Harknett, head of the political science department at the University of Cincinnati, the lack of certainty in of attributing responsibility to a particular actor exacerbates the need to act.181 The uncertainty inherent in the attribution process affects decision-making speed. It is essential to consider the degree of certainty in attributing responsibility as a variable in the assessment because this is not addressed in absolute terms under international law and remains a question of what would be considered acceptable to legitimize a response to a cyber act.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201c\u201cCyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the LOAC to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.\u201d30 The LOAC provides guidance on the use of force necessary to invoke a nation\u2019s right to self-defense.31 A certain level of response to a cyber act is dependent upon meeting the threshold of the \u201cuse of force\u201d under LOAC.32 Cyber activities have been characterized in three ways: (1) cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the state\u2019s ability to respond with a use of force; (2) cyber activities that are equivalent to the threshold to respond with a use of force, but do not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack;\u201d and (3) cyber activities that are equal to an armed attack.33 As defined above, cyberattacks that are considered armed attacks must produce consequences equivalent to a physical attack that causes destruction of property, grave injury, and death.34 \u201cAny computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.\u201d35\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 5)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual was produced to address the deficiency of law as it related specifically to cyber operations; however, the rules outlined in the Tallinn Manual are not enforceable in the same manner as LOAC and are not accepted by every state under the United Nations.127 Additionally, the Tallinn Manual did not have representatives contribute from many of the countries within the United Nations, such as Russia, China, and other Eastern states.128 The most severe limitation to overcome with the Tallinn Manual is that it does not provide the authority needed to enforce LOAC principles redefined under the Tallinn Manual in terms of cyber operations.129\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 14)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C567.4168%2C411.0001%2C578.5378%5D%2C%5B75%2C554.2445%2C411.0279999999999%2C565.3655%5D%2C%5B75%2C541.0721%2C411.0002%2C552.1931%5D%2C%5B75%2C527.8996999999999%2C410.97299999999996%2C539.0206999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C514.7274%2C411.00420000000025%2C526.525263%5D%2C%5B75%2C501.55510000000004%2C411.0001%2C513.3529629999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C488.3827%2C410.9961%2C499.5037%5D%2C%5B75%2C475.2104%2C411.0002%2C487.008263%5D%2C%5B75%2C462.038%2C411.0001%2C473.159%5D%2C%5B75%2C448.8657%2C411.0037999999998%2C459.9867%5D%2C%5B75%2C435.6933%2C411.024%2C447.49116300000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C422.521%2C411.0001%2C433.642%5D%2C%5B75%2C409.3487%2C411.0059999999999%2C420.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C396.1763%2C411.0001%2C407.2973%5D%2C%5B75%2C383.00390000000004%2C411.0001%2C394.1249%5D%2C%5B75%2C369.83160000000004%2C411.01700000000005%2C380.9526%5D%2C%5B75%2C356.65930000000003%2C411.01590000000004%2C367.7803%5D%2C%5B75%2C343.48690000000005%2C411.0001%2C354.60790000000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C330.31460000000004%2C411.03789999999987%2C341.4356%5D%2C%5B75%2C317.1422%2C361.77220000000005%2C328.2632%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe United States defines cyberspace as a \u201cglobal domain within the information environment consisting of interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\u201d1 As a domain, it is necessary to operate in and defend the same as the domains of land, sea, air, and space.2 The employment of cyberspace capabilities is available for both countries with advanced military capabilities and those countries or organizations that are not technologically advanced.3 Computer and networks used by state and non-state actors to \u201cdisrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy\u201d information and infrastructure is the definition of cyber operations.4 When ascertaining adversaries in situations involving cyberspace, the anonymity that is inherent to this domain provides an avenue for adversaries to commit acts that take advantage of vulnerabilities within the cyber realm without committing an overt act that would otherwise have serious consequences.

The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 22</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C197.5702%2C411.05229999999983%2C208.6912%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.5113%2C411.000015%2C196.30916299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.45239999999998%2C411.02580000000023%2C182.5734%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.3935%2C410.9902%2C170.191363%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.3346%2C411.0051000000004%2C157.132463%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.2757%2C411.0002%2C143.3967%5D%2C%5B75%2C119.2168%2C410.97299999999996%2C130.3378%5D%2C%5B75%2C106.15780000000001%2C411.0002%2C117.2788%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.0989%2C410.98510000000016%2C104.2199%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C411.0001%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe United States works with the international community to apply existing international laws and the principles of the law of war to cyber operations.15 Specific international laws may apply to cyber operations even though the laws were created before cyberspace became a domain.16 Therefore, terminology as it relates to cyberspace continues to develop.17 However, there are certain terms that require definitions that relate specifically to cyber operations to understand the context better and threshold required for responses.

Additionally, attribution is critical because, if the support of nonstate actors by a perpetrating state can be established and meet the elements of proof that make the act attributable to the perpetrating state, then the cyber act can rise to the level of international conflict under LOAC.103 Further, evidence that other states supported non-state actors in another territory in the pursuit of a cyber act that meets the threshold of an armed attack can \u201cinternationalize\u201d a conflict that was considered a non-international armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.104 Support of other states is legally significant because the rules under international law then apply to an armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.105\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C284.2253%2C411.0001%2C295.3463%5D%2C%5B75%2C270.6129%2C410.99170000000015%2C281.7339%5D%2C%5B75%2C257.0006%2C410.95430000000005%2C268.1216%5D%2C%5B75%2C243.38819999999998%2C410.9932%2C255.186063%5D%2C%5B75%2C229.77589999999998%2C410.99460000000005%2C241.57376299999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C216.1635%2C411.0001%2C227.2845%5D%2C%5B75%2C202.5512%2C411.0049000000001%2C214.349063%5D%2C%5B75%2C188.9388%2C411.0016000000005%2C200.0598%5D%2C%5B75%2C175.32649999999998%2C411.0001%2C187.124363%5D%2C%5B75%2C161.7141%2C411.0001%2C172.8351%5D%2C%5B75%2C148.1018%2C411.0001%2C159.89966299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C134.4894%2C410.97850000000057%2C145.6104%5D%2C%5B75%2C120.87710000000001%2C410.9884000000006%2C131.9981%5D%2C%5B75%2C107.2647%2C411.0001%2C118.3857%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.6524%2C410.9708000000004%2C105.450263%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.98440000000016%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn an interview with Maj Zachary Smith\u2014 deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Divisionhe indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace;

Though human factors are an essential part of the attribution process, other variables are also important in considering a multi-dimensional approach. Other considerations in addition to the type of cyber activity and actors involved are the risk associated with the act and the speed in which attribution can be accomplished.180 According to Dr. Richard Harknett, head of the political science department at the University of Cincinnati, the lack of certainty in of attributing responsibility to a particular actor exacerbates the need to act.181 The uncertainty inherent in the attribution process affects decision-making speed. It is essential to consider the degree of certainty in attributing responsibility as a variable in the assessment because this is not addressed in absolute terms under international law and remains a question of what would be considered acceptable to legitimize a response to a cyber act.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 22</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C437.6098%2C411.00390000000004%2C448.7308%5D%2C%5B75%2C424.36650000000003%2C411.0002%2C435.4875%5D%2C%5B75%2C411.1232%2C411.0002%2C422.921063%5D%2C%5B75%2C397.87980000000005%2C410.96889999999996%2C409.677663%5D%2C%5B75%2C384.6365%2C411.0225%2C395.7575%5D%2C%5B75%2C371.39320000000004%2C411.0002%2C383.19106300000004%5D%2C%5B75%2C358.1499%2C410.9388999999999%2C369.2709%5D%2C%5B75%2C344.9065%2C410.9598000000002%2C356.0275%5D%2C%5B75%2C331.6632%2C411.0002%2C342.7842%5D%2C%5B75%2C318.41990000000004%2C411.0002%2C330.217763%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C305.1766%2C411.0002%2C316.2976%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C291.9332%2C411.0049999999999%2C303.0542%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C278.6899%2C411.0002%2C290.48776300000003%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C265.44660000000005%2C410.9807999999999%2C276.5676%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C252.20329999999998%2C411.000115%2C264.001163%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201c\u201cCyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the LOAC to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.\u201d30 The LOAC provides guidance on the use of force necessary to invoke a nation\u2019s right to self-defense.31 A certain level of response to a cyber act is dependent upon meeting the threshold of the \u201cuse of force\u201d under LOAC.32 Cyber activities have been characterized in three ways: (1) cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the state\u2019s ability to respond with a use of force; (2) cyber activities that are equivalent to the threshold to respond with a use of force, but do not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack;\u201d and (3) cyber activities that are equal to an armed attack.33 As defined above, cyberattacks that are considered armed attacks must produce consequences equivalent to a physical attack that causes destruction of property, grave injury, and death.34 \u201cAny computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.\u201d35\u201d</span>

The more non-state actors exploit cyber vulnerabilities of victim states, the more perpetrating states may choose to support non-state actors covertly, resulting in victim states developing liberal cases for meeting those thresholds.146 The burden of proof is on the victim state in these cases, and the victim states need evidence on which to base their assessment.147\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 16</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "AG Hill", "date": "2019", "journal": null, "title": "Ultimate Challenge: Attribution for Cyber Operations", "abstract": "\u2026 still prevalent in the area of cyber attribution, and further recommendations for future study. \u2026 However, \u201cthe governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that \u2026", "doi": null, "item_type": "book", "url": "https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Papers/WF_70_HILL_THE_ULTIMATE_CHALLENGE_ATTRIBUTION_FOR_CYBER_OPERATIONS.PDF", "conferenceName": null, "pages": null, "short_title": "Ultimate Challenge", "item_id": "6ZQUMIV6", "citation_key": "hillUltimateChallengeAttribution2019", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/NACYNRR7", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1405044}}], "keywords": ["#legal_representation_of_cyber_acts #laws_of_armed_conflict #state_and_non-state_actors #cyber_vulnerabilities #Hill #LOAC #attribution_thresholds"], "score": [0.33], "paragraph_id": [44329434]}, "evidence OR cyber OR attribution ": {"section_title": ["Analysis: Evidentiary Considerations in Attribution", "Introduction", "Analysis: Introduction into Multi-Dimensional Approach to Attribution", "Analysis: Evidentiary Considerations in Attribution", "Analysis: Introduction into Multi-Dimensional Approach to Attribution", "Analysis: Evidentiary Considerations in Attribution", "Conclusion", "Analysis: Limited Technology", "Analysis: Limited Technology", "Analysis: Introduction into Multi-Dimensional Approach to Attribution"], "paragraph_title": ["International law lacks clear evidentiary standards for attributing cyber operations.", "Attribution of cyber acts is complicated by misconceptions about cyberspace.", "Human factors are essential for effective cyber attribution beyond legal frameworks.", "Attribution relies on diverse sources of information including forensics and circumstantial evidence.", "Attribution requires a comprehensive analysis of cyber acts and actors.", "Victim states face complex challenges in attribution due to ambiguous international law.", "Victim states bear the responsibility for proving attribution in order for international law to apply.", "There are five main categories of cyber threats, each presenting unique attribution challenges.", "Technical attribution methods may be inadequate due to the ability of perpetrators to mask their identities.", "Timing and additional considerations enhance the clarity and sufficiency of attribution evidence."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cBecause of the nature of cyberspace, attribution, which is \u201cthe action of regarding something as being caused by a person or thing,\u201d hostile or malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the \u201cunderlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.\u201d7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 1)", "\u201cSince attribution inherently comes with a degree of uncertainty, the human factors also provide circumstantial evidence to support the attribution to a particular actor or state. The process of attributing a cyber act to a state or non-state actor is a \u201cnuanced and multi-layered process.\u201d177 Therefore, attribution cannot be considered merely a technical problem.178 It is a social problem in a technically fluid environment meaning that technology alone is not sufficient to attribute a cyber act to a state or non-state actor to the level required under international law.179 Accordingly, a multi-dimensional approach that incorporates multiple factors typically used in law enforcement to gather evidence of the nature of the offender is needed to effectively attribute hostile, malicious cyber acts to the appropriate and responsible party.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201cIt is well established that in its very general sense, \u201cattribution is a multidimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, geopolitics, among other\u201d things.197 Such human factors assist in the attribution of individuals and groups to a particular state. Circumstantial evidence such as background and associations provide victim states with information that can link an individual or groups to a particular state. These types of factors provide a picture of the party responsible and the likelihood the party is associated with others. In the law enforcement field, an investigator\u2019s study of a perpetrator\u2019s past affiliations and associations can provide significant leads that can help identify the responsible party behind a particular criminal act. Similarly, attribution can also include the determination if an act was meant to be malicious or hostile in the first place.198 Additional factors provide an opportunity for states to generate an accurate threat picture that can guide them in the collection of evidence in their case for attribution.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 24)", "\u201cAs discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is \u201cnecessary to consider the issue of the \u2018originator\u2019 in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack\u201d and \u201cindisputable that the actions of nonstate actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.\u201d173\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cIn attribution, victim states must assess the act, the actor, and any other potential factors that provide information to support the victim state\u2019s theory of responsibility for the cyber act. The lack of defined terms and ambiguous thresholds present in international law creates a complex task for victim states in the pursuit of responding to cyber acts. Attribution is vital to a victim state because responsibility of an act must be determined before a response can be implemented. Further, as described above, international law requires the act to meet a particular threshold in order for a victim state to respond in proportionality. The ability of a victim state to respond is related to the severity of the act.186 \u201cIn principle, the graver the underlying breach, the greater the confidence must be in the evidence relied upon.\u201d187 The reason behind this statement is that with the rise in severity of the act comes a higher risk that the determination of responsibility could produce a proportionate response from a victim state. If incorrectly attributed, it could be devastating to another state.188 This error is a particularly crucial evidentiary consideration when determining the attribution of a cyber act committed by non-state actors and the attempt to attribute that act to a state.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cAttribution of cyber acts is the responsibility of victim states, and as evidenced in detail above, victim states are required to prove that cyber acts meet certain thresholds. Attributing acts to a perpetrating state must occur in order for international law to apply. Generally, the law provides states with the elements of proof that they must meet to attribute responsibility for a crime; however, as of the writing of international law today, there are not any definitive elements of proof for victim states to use in their efforts to prove accountability for cyber acts that do not meet the threshold of use of force or armed attack, or prove the accountability of a cyber act to a perpetrating state. Therefore, more research in the definition of specific terms under international law\u2014such as use of force and armed attack\u2014is critical if the attribution problem is to be solved. Furthermore, reaching an international collaboration of understanding in the operation of cyberspace is for not only states but also for explicitly addressing the issue of non-state actors perpetrating cyber acts against victim states.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 25)", "\u201cThe use of technological and forensic tools may allow cyber professionals to implicate perpetrators in cyber incidents; however, there may be circumstances in which technical attribution is insufficient given the ease by which perpetrators may mask their identity, evading responsibility for the act. Circumstances may be such that even though technological means determine a particular actor involved, there may be further evidence to consider that may lead to responsibility attributed to a state rather than an individual actor or group. To further complicate this issue, a state may not want to expose the actor if that effort would undermine the state\u2019s efforts politically or expose any use of tradecraft. The social and political aspects can be crucial to a state\u2019s decision-making in terms of attribution and response.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 18)", "\u201cThe use of technological and forensic tools may allow cyber professionals to implicate perpetrators in cyber incidents; however, there may be circumstances in which technical attribution is insufficient given the ease by which perpetrators may mask their identity, evading responsibility for the act.

Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act. The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court. As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible. The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A29%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.9918%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0236000000002%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C410.9818%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0001%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0002%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.01280000000037%2C365.377963%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0006000000001%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0013000000002%2C326.300863%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.04560000000015%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C411.0133000000003%2C300.249363%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0445000000005%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0001%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.03460000000024%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C411.0001%2C235.12076299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0137000000001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C411.0002%2C208.3925%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0159000000001%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C410.99970000000013%2C183.01786299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C410.9708000000002%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C411.0007000000001%2C156.96646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.1429%2C408.8654000000004%2C143.2639%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence.

There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is \u201cnecessary to consider the issue of the \u2018originator\u2019 in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack\u201d and \u201cindisputable that the actions of nonstate actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.\u201d173\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C119.77000000000001%2C410.9467000000003%2C130.891%5D%2C%5B75%2C106.5267%2C411.0324000000002%2C117.6477%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.28330000000001%2C410.96750000000014%2C104.4043%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.98180000000036%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn attribution, victim states must assess the act, the actor, and any other potential factors that provide information to support the victim state\u2019s theory of responsibility for the cyber act.

As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cA consensus of the international community on the definition of terms and legal processes afforded to victim states decreases the amount of ambiguity associated with the process of attribution. As previously explored, there are already issues with attribution as a result of the inherent nature of cyberspace. A more definitive stance written into international law would alleviate the burden of attempting to define the act in addition to finding the actor and then proving involvement with a perpetrating state. Additional research and a push for international consensus may be worth the effort to establish an effective international legal position.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 25)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives. The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A29%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.9918%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0236000000002%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C410.9818%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0001%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0002%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.01280000000037%2C365.377963%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0006000000001%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0013000000002%2C326.300863%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.04560000000015%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C411.0133000000003%2C300.249363%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0445000000005%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0001%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.03460000000024%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C411.0001%2C235.12076299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0137000000001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C411.0002%2C208.3925%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0159000000001%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C410.99970000000013%2C183.01786299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C410.9708000000002%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C411.0007000000001%2C156.96646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.1429%2C408.8654000000004%2C143.2639%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A31%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C471.04310000000004%2C411.01380000000006%2C482.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C458.04310000000004%2C410.96970000000016%2C469.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C445.04310000000004%2C411.03570000000036%2C456.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C432.04310000000004%2C410.9708000000003%2C443.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C419.04310000000004%2C410.9697000000004%2C430.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C406.04310000000004%2C411.0005%2C417.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C393.04310000000004%2C410.98070000000007%2C404.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C380.04310000000004%2C411.0001%2C391.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C367.04310000000004%2C226.9837000000001%2C378.1641%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA consensus of the international community on the definition of terms and legal processes afforded to victim states decreases the amount of ambiguity associated with the process of attribution. As previously explored, there are already issues with attribution as a result of the inherent nature of cyberspace. A more definitive stance written into international law would alleviate the burden of attempting to define the act in addition to finding the actor and then proving involvement with a perpetrating state. Additional research and a push for international consensus may be worth the effort to establish an effective international legal position.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 25</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p>Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C366.6059%2C410.96980000000013%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.0002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00012%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9719000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0002%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C410.98180000000036%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.95650000000023%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0005000000003%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0049000000003%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C410.9795000000004%2C248.14646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C410.97960000000023%2C234.4439%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C410.9992000000002%2C209.06936299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0148000000004%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C411.0346000000002%2C182.3411%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C411.0001%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C280.88912%2C156.96646299999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives.

actors in cyberspace can be a major contention for victim states under international law. The International Law Commission\u2019s \u201cDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d represents that states are responsible for \u201cinternationally wrongful acts\u201d perpetuated against victim states.87 These acts have two distinctions.88 First, the act has to breach an international obligation and second, the act has to be attributable to a state.89 If a state commits an act that breaches international law, the state must immediately stop the act or comply with their legal obligation, in the case of an omission, and \u201cmake full reparation of the injured state.\u201d90 Therefore, in the case of cyber acts, if the state breaches its international obligation, it is required to cease the cyber act immediately. Further, in the case of non-state actors acting on behalf of a state\u2014in which the cyber act committed by the non-state actors is attributable to that state\u2014 the state must follow the same guidelines. If the perpetrating state does not fulfill its duty under international law, victim states may take countermeasures, which are actions \u201ccontrary to the international obligations of [an] injured state vis-\u00e0-vis the responsible state if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act . . . to procure cessation and reparation.\u201d91 These countermeasures would not constitute an internationally wrongful act as long as they comply with the requirements for countermeasures under the international law of state responsibility.92\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)", "\u201cMoreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and nonstate actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of \u201cacting under the direction or control of a state.\u201d140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 16)", "\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives. The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cA state can also be found responsible for a cyber act through the \u201cnonintervention principle,\u201d which refers to perpetrating states compelling other states\u2019 affairs.93 \u201cThe International Court of Justice has confirmed that the non-intervention principle is violated, for example, if a state provides financial support, training, a supply of weapons, intelligence, and logistic support to a terrorist or insurgent group operating in another state.\u201d94 Thus, under the non-intervention principle, cyber acts that are committed by non-state actors can be attributable to a state if the state is found to have supplied malware, trained the group on how to administer the malware, and provided support in committing the act. A state may not wittingly allow using its territory to violate other states\u2019 rights, whether the act is a traditional kinetic act or a cyber act originating in the perpetrating state\u2019s territory.95 For example, a state would be responsible for shutting down a cyber act committed by non-state actors if the act violated another state\u2019s rights. However, whether the state was responsible for the non-state actor\u2019s act, to begin with, is a question of attribution.96\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C158.527%2C410.96870000000007%2C169.648%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.4458%2C410.98290000000003%2C156.5668%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.3646%2C411.0258000000002%2C143.4856%5D%2C%5B75%2C119.2835%2C411.0001%2C130.40449999999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C106.20230000000001%2C411.0005%2C118.000163%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.1212%2C411.0002%2C104.2422%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C411.02710000000036%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution of non-state actors in cyberspace can be a major contention for victim states under international law.

The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 16</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C366.6059%2C410.96980000000013%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.0002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00012%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9719000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0002%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C410.98180000000036%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.95650000000023%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0005000000003%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0049000000003%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C410.9795000000004%2C248.14646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C410.97960000000023%2C234.4439%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C410.9992000000002%2C209.06936299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0148000000004%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C411.0346000000002%2C182.3411%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C411.0001%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C280.88912%2C156.96646299999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives.

equally important is understanding the applicable view of determining whether an armed attack has occurred.136 Unfortunately, even the experts on the council charged with writing the still recent scholarship of the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on a standard for the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace. They also could not agree on what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state. There is not a definitive law in place regarding the threshold of an armed attack. International scholars in the production of the Tallinn Manual have not been able to define the criteria of an armed attack, and the international community has not been able to classify any cyber acts as meeting that threshold. \u201cNo international cyber incidents have, as of 2012, been unambiguously and publicly characterized by the international community as reaching the threshold of an armed attack.\u201d137 The assessment of scale and effects is essential, but also equally important is the agreement of the international community in the determination of an armed attack.138 Further, even the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace or what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 15)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "\u201cMoreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and nonstate actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of \u201cacting under the direction or control of a state.\u201d140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 16)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cAttribution of non-state actors in cyberspace can be a major contention for victim states under international law. The International Law Commission\u2019s \u201cDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d represents that states are responsible for \u201cinternationally wrongful acts\u201d perpetuated against victim states.87 These acts have two distinctions.88 First, the act has to breach an international obligation and second, the act has to be attributable to a state.89 If a state commits an act that breaches international law, the state must immediately stop the act or comply with their legal obligation, in the case of an omission, and \u201cmake full reparation of the injured state.\u201d90 Therefore, in the case of cyber acts, if the state breaches its international obligation, it is required to cease the cyber act immediately. Further, in the case of non-state actors acting on behalf of a state\u2014in which the cyber act committed by the non-state actors is attributable to that state\u2014 the state must follow the same guidelines. If the perpetrating state does not fulfill its duty under international law, victim states may take countermeasures, which are actions \u201ccontrary to the international obligations of [an] injured state vis-\u00e0-vis the responsible state if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act . . . to procure cessation and reparation.\u201d91 These countermeasures would not constitute an internationally wrongful act as long as they comply with the requirements for countermeasures under the international law of state responsibility.92\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)", "\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives. The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C470.8116%2C411.0001%2C481.9326%5D%2C%5B75%2C457.7859%2C410.9917000000003%2C468.9069%5D%2C%5B75%2C444.7602%2C410.9999000000001%2C456.558063%5D%2C%5B75%2C431.7345%2C411.0016000000004%2C442.8555%5D%2C%5B75%2C418.7088%2C411.0381000000002%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.00050000000033%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C411.00490000000013%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C410.9466000000001%2C390.75260000000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0038000000003%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.00520000000023%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0001%2C351.6754%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0002%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C410.96970000000056%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.0031000000001%2C313.275163%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.9543000000001%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C410.9598000000001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0002%2C274.197963%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.02250000000015%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.0002%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C211.41870000000003%2C234.4439%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile an assessment of scale and effects is essential in determining appropriate response, equally important is understanding the applicable view of determining whether an armed attack has occurred.136 Unfortunately, even the experts on the council charged with writing the still recent scholarship of the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on a standard for the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C158.527%2C410.96870000000007%2C169.648%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.4458%2C410.98290000000003%2C156.5668%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.3646%2C411.0258000000002%2C143.4856%5D%2C%5B75%2C119.2835%2C411.0001%2C130.40449999999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C106.20230000000001%2C411.0005%2C118.000163%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.1212%2C411.0002%2C104.2422%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C411.02710000000036%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution of non-state actors in cyberspace can be a major contention for victim states under international law.

The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C318.41990000000004%2C411.00339999999994%2C329.5409%5D%2C%5B75%2C305.1766%2C410.95100000000014%2C316.2976%5D%2C%5B75%2C291.9332%2C411.04889999999983%2C303.0542%5D%2C%5B75%2C278.6899%2C410.9990000000002%2C290.48776300000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C265.44660000000005%2C411.05109999999985%2C276.5676%5D%2C%5B75%2C252.20329999999998%2C411.0003000000001%2C264.001163%5D%2C%5B75%2C238.9599%2C411.0002%2C250.0809%5D%2C%5B75%2C225.7166%2C411.0002%2C236.8376%5D%2C%5B75%2C212.4733%2C411.0001%2C223.5943%5D%2C%5B75%2C199.2299%2C410.9729999999999%2C210.3509%5D%2C%5B75%2C185.98659999999998%2C411.0002%2C197.784463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C172.7433%2C411.07210000000015%2C183.86430000000001%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C159.5%2C411.0401999999999%2C170.621%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C146.2566%2C411.000115%2C158.054463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C133.0133%2C410.99210000000005%2C144.1343%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C119.77000000000001%2C411.0003%2C131.567863%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C106.5267%2C410.9951000000001%2C117.6477%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C93.28330000000001%2C410.94120000000004%2C104.4043%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C80.04%2C354.348815%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the \u201cunderlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.\u201d7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 1)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cAs a result of the deficiency in international law regarding the issue of nonstate actors perpetrating cyber acts against victim states, there is a high probability that perpetrating states will continue to use non-state actors in their attempts to breach the cyber infrastructures of victim states to avoid the consequences associated with international law. Furthermore, states will continue to use non-state actors to \u201cachieve national security and foreign policy objectives\u201d because of the anonymity of cyberspace and ability of states to deny involvement with the cyber activities of non-state actors.114 As presented in this section, generally, the high level of evidence needed to attribute responsibility to a state or internationalize a non-international armed conflict provides states with the ability to perpetrate without a substantial risk of retaliation.115\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 12)", "\u201cThe additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process. Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act. The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court. As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible. The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201cAs discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is \u201cnecessary to consider the issue of the \u2018originator\u2019 in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack\u201d and \u201cindisputable that the actions of nonstate actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.\u201d173\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cLOAC distinguishes between international armed conflict between states and non-international conflict between a state and non-state actors, such as an organized group.102 Attribution in these cases is critical because of the ability of victim states to respond with the use of force against the state or nonstate actors. Additionally, attribution is critical because, if the support of nonstate actors by a perpetrating state can be established and meet the elements of proof that make the act attributable to the perpetrating state, then the cyber act can rise to the level of international conflict under LOAC.103 Further, evidence that other states supported non-state actors in another territory in the pursuit of a cyber act that meets the threshold of an armed attack can \u201cinternationalize\u201d a conflict that was considered a non-international armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.104 Support of other states is legally significant because the rules under international law then apply to an armed conflict between a victim state and non-state actors.105\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C303.9699%2C410.9896%2C315.0909%5D%2C%5B75%2C290.7975%2C411.0001%2C301.9185%5D%2C%5B75%2C277.6252%2C411.01310000000007%2C289.423063%5D%2C%5B75%2C264.4528%2C410.9967%2C276.25066300000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C251.2805%2C411.0126000000006%2C262.4015%5D%2C%5B75%2C238.10809999999998%2C410.96620000000013%2C249.90596299999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C224.9358%2C410.9920000000002%2C236.73366299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C211.7634%2C411.0001%2C223.561263%5D%2C%5B75%2C198.59109999999998%2C411.02470000000034%2C209.7121%5D%2C%5B75%2C185.4188%2C410.96970000000016%2C196.5398%5D%2C%5B75%2C172.2464%2C411.0001%2C183.3674%5D%2C%5B75%2C159.0741%2C411.0016000000002%2C170.1951%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.9017%2C410.9708000000004%2C157.02270000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.7294%2C411.0001%2C143.8504%5D%2C%5B75%2C119.557%2C230.37987999999999%2C131.354863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cBecause of the nature of cyberspace, attribution, which is \u201cthe action of regarding something as being caused by a person or thing,\u201d hostile or malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the \u201cunderlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.\u201d7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 1</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A29%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.9918%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0236000000002%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C410.9818%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0001%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0002%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.01280000000037%2C365.377963%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0006000000001%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0013000000002%2C326.300863%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.04560000000015%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C411.0133000000003%2C300.249363%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0445000000005%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0001%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.03460000000024%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C411.0001%2C235.12076299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0137000000001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C411.0002%2C208.3925%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0159000000001%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C410.99970000000013%2C183.01786299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C410.9708000000002%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C411.0007000000001%2C156.96646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.1429%2C408.8654000000004%2C143.2639%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence.

Additionally, attribution is critical because, if the support of nonstate actors by a perpetrating state can be established and meet the elements of proof that make the act attributable to the perpetrating state, then the cyber act can rise to the level of international conflict under LOAC.103 Further, evidence that other states supported non-state actors in another territory in the pursuit of a cyber act that meets the threshold of an armed attack can \u201cinternationalize\u201d a conflict that was considered a non-international armed conflict between a victim state and non-state

"paragraph_text": ["\u201cSince attribution inherently comes with a degree of uncertainty, the human factors also provide circumstantial evidence to support the attribution to a particular actor or state. The process of attributing a cyber act to a state or non-state actor is a \u201cnuanced and multi-layered process.\u201d177 Therefore, attribution cannot be considered merely a technical problem.178 It is a social problem in a technically fluid environment meaning that technology alone is not sufficient to attribute a cyber act to a state or non-state actor to the level required under international law.179 Accordingly, a multi-dimensional approach that incorporates multiple factors typically used in law enforcement to gather evidence of the nature of the offender is needed to effectively attribute hostile, malicious cyber acts to the appropriate and responsible party.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201cBecause of the nature of cyberspace, attribution, which is \u201cthe action of regarding something as being caused by a person or thing,\u201d hostile or malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the \u201cunderlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.\u201d7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 1)", "\u201cIt is well established that in its very general sense, \u201cattribution is a multidimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, geopolitics, among other\u201d things.197 Such human factors assist in the attribution of individuals and groups to a particular state. Circumstantial evidence such as background and associations provide victim states with information that can link an individual or groups to a particular state. These types of factors provide a picture of the party responsible and the likelihood the party is associated with others. In the law enforcement field, an investigator\u2019s study of a perpetrator\u2019s past affiliations and associations can provide significant leads that can help identify the responsible party behind a particular criminal act. Similarly, attribution can also include the determination if an act was meant to be malicious or hostile in the first place.198 Additional factors provide an opportunity for states to generate an accurate threat picture that can guide them in the collection of evidence in their case for attribution.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 24)", "\u201cAs discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is \u201cnecessary to consider the issue of the \u2018originator\u2019 in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack\u201d and \u201cindisputable that the actions of nonstate actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.\u201d173\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cThe additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process. Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act. The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court.

The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem.

There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state.

Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C296.6899%2C411.0226000000002%2C307.8109%5D%2C%5B75%2C283.44660000000005%2C411.0401%2C294.5676%5D%2C%5B75%2C270.2033%2C410.98180000000013%2C281.3243%5D%2C%5B75%2C256.9599%2C411.0001%2C268.0809%5D%2C%5B75%2C243.7166%2C411.0002%2C254.8376%5D%2C%5B75%2C230.4733%2C410.98070000000035%2C241.5943%5D%2C%5B75%2C217.2299%2C411.00050000000016%2C228.3509%5D%2C%5B75%2C203.98659999999998%2C410.9994000000003%2C215.1076%5D%2C%5B75%2C190.7433%2C411.0002%2C201.86430000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C177.5%2C411.03240000000017%2C188.621%5D%2C%5B75%2C164.2566%2C364.70040000000034%2C175.3776%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process.

cyberspace, attribution, which is \u201cthe action of regarding something as being caused by a person or thing,\u201d hostile or malicious cyber acts can be difficult to ascertain.5 According to Rid and Buchanan, there are three common assumptions related to technical attribution.6 First, attribution is difficult as a result of the \u201cunderlying technical architecture and geography of the Internet.\u201d7 Second, a redesign of the Internet would solve the attribution problem.8 Finally, the issue of accountability does not lie in the analysis of evidence, but rather the discovery of the evidence.9 The first assumption describes how the nature of cyberspace interferes when attributing acts to a particular actor. The second assumption further illustrates that the inherent nature of the Internet is the reason attribution is an issue. If the infrastructure was modified to negate the ability of actors to act anonymously, then attribution would not necessarily be a problem. However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 1)", "\u201cIt is well established that in its very general sense, \u201cattribution is a multidimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, geopolitics, among other\u201d things.197 Such human factors assist in the attribution of individuals and groups to a particular state. Circumstantial evidence such as background and associations provide victim states with information that can link an individual or groups to a particular state. These types of factors provide a picture of the party responsible and the likelihood the party is associated with others. In the law enforcement field, an investigator\u2019s study of a perpetrator\u2019s past affiliations and associations can provide significant leads that can help identify the responsible party behind a particular criminal act. Similarly, attribution can also include the determination if an act was meant to be malicious or hostile in the first place.198 Additional factors provide an opportunity for states to generate an accurate threat picture that can guide them in the collection of evidence in their case for attribution.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 24)", "\u201cAs a result of the deficiency in international law regarding the issue of nonstate actors perpetrating cyber acts against victim states, there is a high probability that perpetrating states will continue to use non-state actors in their attempts to breach the cyber infrastructures of victim states to avoid the consequences associated with international law. Furthermore, states will continue to use non-state actors to \u201cachieve national security and foreign policy objectives\u201d because of the anonymity of cyberspace and ability of states to deny involvement with the cyber activities of non-state actors.114 As presented in this section, generally, the high level of evidence needed to attribute responsibility to a state or internationalize a non-international armed conflict provides states with the ability to perpetrate without a substantial risk of retaliation.115\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 12)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cAs discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law. Though it is necessary to locate the origin of the act, it is also equally important to determine if a non-state actor is connected to and potentially working for a nation-state. As the Tallinn Manual states, it is \u201cnecessary to consider the issue of the \u2018originator\u2019 in determining whether an act qualifies as an armed attack\u201d and \u201cindisputable that the actions of nonstate actors may sometimes be attributed to a State for the purposes of finding an armed attack.\u201d173\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cSince attribution inherently comes with a degree of uncertainty, the human factors also provide circumstantial evidence to support the attribution to a particular actor or state. The process of attributing a cyber act to a state or non-state actor is a \u201cnuanced and multi-layered process.\u201d177 Therefore, attribution cannot be considered merely a technical problem.178 It is a social problem in a technically fluid environment meaning that technology alone is not sufficient to attribute a cyber act to a state or non-state actor to the level required under international law.179 Accordingly, a multi-dimensional approach that incorporates multiple factors typically used in law enforcement to gather evidence of the nature of the offender is needed to effectively attribute hostile, malicious cyber acts to the appropriate and responsible party.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 22)", "\u201cThe additional considerations discussed in this section are only a small amount of potential variables that should be considered in the attribution process. Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act.

However, the process of attribution in cyberspace is \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political\u201d than these assumptions allow.10\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 1</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A29%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.124%2C119.11710000000001%2C410.939%2C130.2381%5D%2C%5B75%2C106.09150000000001%2C411.0411999999998%2C117.2125%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.0657%2C411.01700000000005%2C104.1867%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C411.0261%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIt is well established that in its very general sense, \u201cattribution is a multidimensional issue that draws on all sources of information available, including forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, geopolitics, among other\u201d things.197 Such human factors assist in the attribution of individuals and</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A30%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B75%2C588.0431%2C411.00490000000013%2C599.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C574.9619%2C411.00600000000003%2C586.0829%5D%2C%5B75%2C561.8807999999999%2C411.0555%2C573.0017999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C548.7995999999999%2C411.00490000000025%2C559.9205999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C535.7185%2C411.00489999999985%2C546.8394999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C522.6373%2C411.0001%2C533.7583%5D%2C%5B75%2C509.5561000000001%2C411.00160000000005%2C520.6771%5D%2C%5B75%2C496.475%2C411.0588000000001%2C507.596%5D%2C%5B75%2C483.3938%2C411.02250000000015%2C495.191663%5D%2C%5B75%2C470.31260000000003%2C410.94989999999996%2C481.4336%5D%2C%5B75%2C457.23150000000004%2C182.87809999999993%2C468.3525%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%7D\">groups to a particular state.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C284.208%2C410.9687000000003%2C295.329%5D%2C%5B75%2C270.59680000000003%2C410.9895000000004%2C281.7178%5D%2C%5B75%2C256.98560000000003%2C411.0001%2C268.1066%5D%2C%5B75%2C243.37439999999998%2C410.9917000000001%2C254.4954%5D%2C%5B75%2C229.76319999999998%2C411.0016000000003%2C240.8842%5D%2C%5B75%2C216.152%2C411.0001%2C227.273%5D%2C%5B75%2C202.5408%2C411.0049000000004%2C213.6618%5D%2C%5B75%2C188.9296%2C410.96640000000025%2C200.0506%5D%2C%5B75%2C175.3184%2C410.9664000000004%2C186.4394%5D%2C%5B75%2C161.7072%2C411.05770000000024%2C172.8282%5D%2C%5B75%2C148.096%2C410.9939000000001%2C159.217%5D%2C%5B75%2C134.48479999999998%2C411.005%2C145.6058%5D%2C%5B75%2C120.87360000000001%2C410.99170000000004%2C131.9946%5D%2C%5B75%2C107.2624%2C410.9488%2C118.3834%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.6512%2C411.0005%2C104.7722%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C159.91351999999998%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs discussed in previous sections, there are additional factors involved in the attribution process beyond technological or forensic processes. There are different types of cyber acts and actors that are part of the criteria for analyzing the severity of response. Therefore, the process of attribution must require an analysis of the different possibilities of acts and actors that will assist in the decision of what response is appropriate for the initial cyber act. This assessment is imperative in the collection of evidence to attribute the cyber activity to a particular entity or individual. Furthermore, the determination of the source of an act is critical because of the implications the act and actor can have under international law.

Similar to law enforcement, the analysis of variables leads to more potential information and evidence that can aid in the determination of responsibility for an act. The primary purpose of presenting additional considerations is to provoke thought as to what factors are necessary for victim states to determine what is sufficient to convince in an international court. As in traditional cases of hostile acts, a myriad of evidence is needed to persuade others that a particular party is responsible. The lack of clarity under international law for cyber acts below the threshold of warfare leave victim states with acquiring their elements of proof to protect their sovereignty.\u201d</span> <span

the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply.22 Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering.23 However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.24\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.99180000000024%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0522000000004%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C411.0001%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0002%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0005000000003%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C410.9851000000002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00630000000024%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9378000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C149.64108%2C326.300863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply.

It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C106.38470000000001%2C411.0226000000002%2C117.5057%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.21230000000001%2C411.0002%2C104.33330000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.9774000000001%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response.

The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

an interview with Maj Zachary Smith\u2014 deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Divisionhe indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can

evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cA state can also be found responsible for a cyber act through the \u201cnonintervention principle,\u201d which refers to perpetrating states compelling other states\u2019 affairs.93 \u201cThe International Court of Justice has confirmed that the non-intervention principle is violated, for example, if a state provides financial support, training, a supply of weapons, intelligence, and logistic support to a terrorist or insurgent group operating in another state.\u201d94 Thus, under the non-intervention principle, cyber acts that are committed by non-state actors can be attributable to a state if the state is found to have supplied malware, trained the group on how to administer the malware, and provided support in committing the act. A state may not wittingly allow using its territory to violate other states\u2019 rights, whether the act is a traditional kinetic act or a cyber act originating in the perpetrating state\u2019s territory.95 For example, a state would be responsible for shutting down a cyber act committed by non-state actors if the act violated another state\u2019s rights. However, whether the state was responsible for the non-state actor\u2019s act, to begin with, is a question of attribution.96\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)", "\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives. The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cMoreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and nonstate actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of \u201cacting under the direction or control of a state.\u201d140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 16)", "\u201cWhile an assessment of scale and effects is essential in determining appropriate response, equally important is understanding the applicable view of determining whether an armed attack has occurred.136 Unfortunately, even the experts on the council charged with writing the still recent scholarship of the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on a standard for the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace. They also could not agree on what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state. There is not a definitive law in place regarding the threshold of an armed attack. International scholars in the production of the Tallinn Manual have not been able to define the criteria of an armed attack, and the international community has not been able to classify any cyber acts as meeting that threshold. \u201cNo international cyber incidents have, as of 2012, been unambiguously and publicly characterized by the international community as reaching the threshold of an armed attack.\u201d137 The assessment of scale and effects is essential, but also equally important is the agreement of the international community in the determination of an armed attack.138 Further, even the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace or what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 15)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A29%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.9918%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0236000000002%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C410.9818%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0001%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0002%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.01280000000037%2C365.377963%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0006000000001%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0013000000002%2C326.300863%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.04560000000015%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C411.0133000000003%2C300.249363%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0445000000005%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0001%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.03460000000024%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C411.0001%2C235.12076299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0137000000001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C411.0002%2C208.3925%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0159000000001%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C410.99970000000013%2C183.01786299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C410.9708000000002%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C411.0007000000001%2C156.96646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C132.1429%2C408.8654000000004%2C143.2639%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C405.683%2C411.0468000000004%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C410.9686000000002%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0206000000001%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0002%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C410.96860000000027%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.01410000000016%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.00600000000014%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C410.9851%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C410.95979999999986%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.9851000000003%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.02139999999974%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C410.9887000000003%2C274.197963%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C410.98400000000004%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C410.9774000000001%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C381.968515%2C235.12076299999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA state can also be found responsible for a cyber act through the \u201cnonintervention principle,\u201d which refers to perpetrating states compelling other states\u2019 affairs.93 \u201cThe International Court of Justice has confirmed that the non-intervention principle is violated, for example, if a state provides financial support, training, a supply of weapons, intelligence, and logistic support to a terrorist or insurgent group operating in another state.\u201d94 Thus, under the non-intervention principle, cyber acts that are committed by non-state actors can be attributable to a state if the state is found to have supplied malware, trained the group on how to administer the malware, and provided support in committing the act. A state may not wittingly allow using its territory to violate other states\u2019 rights, whether the act is a traditional kinetic act or a cyber act originating in the perpetrating state\u2019s territory.95 For example, a state would be responsible for shutting down a cyber act committed by non-state actors if the act violated another state\u2019s rights.

The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 16</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C470.8116%2C411.0001%2C481.9326%5D%2C%5B75%2C457.7859%2C410.9917000000003%2C468.9069%5D%2C%5B75%2C444.7602%2C410.9999000000001%2C456.558063%5D%2C%5B75%2C431.7345%2C411.0016000000004%2C442.8555%5D%2C%5B75%2C418.7088%2C411.0381000000002%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.00050000000033%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C411.00490000000013%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C410.9466000000001%2C390.75260000000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0038000000003%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.00520000000023%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.0001%2C351.6754%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C411.0002%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C410.96970000000056%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C411.0031000000001%2C313.275163%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.9543000000001%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C410.9598000000001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0002%2C274.197963%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.02250000000015%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C411.0002%2C247.4697%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C211.41870000000003%2C234.4439%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile an assessment of scale and effects is essential in determining appropriate response, equally important is understanding the applicable view of determining whether an armed attack has occurred.136 Unfortunately, even the experts on the council charged with writing the still recent scholarship of the Tallinn Manual could not fully agree on a standard for the determination of an armed attack in cyberspace. They also could not agree on what rights a victim state may have in using force in self-defense against a cyberattack that could not be attributed to a perpetrating state. There is not a definitive law in place regarding the threshold of an armed attack. International scholars in the production of the Tallinn Manual have not been able to define the criteria of an armed attack, and the international community has not been able to classify any cyber acts as meeting that threshold. \u201cNo international cyber incidents have, as of 2012, been unambiguously and publicly characterized by the international community as reaching the threshold of an armed attack.\u201d137 The assessment of scale and effects is essential, but also equally important is the agreement of the international community in the determination of an armed attack.138 Further,

law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply.22 Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering.23 However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.24\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C318.41990000000004%2C411.00339999999994%2C329.5409%5D%2C%5B75%2C305.1766%2C410.95100000000014%2C316.2976%5D%2C%5B75%2C291.9332%2C411.04889999999983%2C303.0542%5D%2C%5B75%2C278.6899%2C410.9990000000002%2C290.48776300000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C265.44660000000005%2C411.05109999999985%2C276.5676%5D%2C%5B75%2C252.20329999999998%2C411.0003000000001%2C264.001163%5D%2C%5B75%2C238.9599%2C411.0002%2C250.0809%5D%2C%5B75%2C225.7166%2C411.0002%2C236.8376%5D%2C%5B75%2C212.4733%2C411.0001%2C223.5943%5D%2C%5B75%2C199.2299%2C410.9729999999999%2C210.3509%5D%2C%5B75%2C185.98659999999998%2C411.0002%2C197.784463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C172.7433%2C411.07210000000015%2C183.86430000000001%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C159.5%2C411.0401999999999%2C170.621%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C146.2566%2C411.000115%2C158.054463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C133.0133%2C410.99210000000005%2C144.1343%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C119.77000000000001%2C411.0003%2C131.567863%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C106.5267%2C410.9951000000001%2C117.6477%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C93.28330000000001%2C410.94120000000004%2C104.4043%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C80.04%2C354.348815%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C106.38470000000001%2C411.0226000000002%2C117.5057%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.21230000000001%2C411.0002%2C104.33330000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.9774000000001%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C318.41990000000004%2C411.00339999999994%2C329.5409%5D%2C%5B75%2C305.1766%2C410.95100000000014%2C316.2976%5D%2C%5B75%2C291.9332%2C411.04889999999983%2C303.0542%5D%2C%5B75%2C278.6899%2C410.9990000000002%2C290.48776300000003%5D%2C%5B75%2C265.44660000000005%2C411.05109999999985%2C276.5676%5D%2C%5B75%2C252.20329999999998%2C411.0003000000001%2C264.001163%5D%2C%5B75%2C238.9599%2C411.0002%2C250.0809%5D%2C%5B75%2C225.7166%2C411.0002%2C236.8376%5D%2C%5B75%2C212.4733%2C411.0001%2C223.5943%5D%2C%5B75%2C199.2299%2C410.9729999999999%2C210.3509%5D%2C%5B75%2C185.98659999999998%2C411.0002%2C197.784463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C172.7433%2C411.07210000000015%2C183.86430000000001%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C159.5%2C411.0401999999999%2C170.621%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C146.2566%2C411.000115%2C158.054463%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C133.0133%2C410.99210000000005%2C144.1343%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C119.77000000000001%2C411.0003%2C131.567863%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C106.5267%2C410.9951000000001%2C117.6477%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C93.28330000000001%2C410.94120000000004%2C104.4043%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C80.04%2C354.348815%2C91.837863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p>Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can

attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply.22 Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering.23 However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.24\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "\u201cIn an interview with Maj Zachary Smith\u2014 deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Divisionhe indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can fit into one of these threat categories, but attribution is the most significant in the case of warfare because of the implications under international law and a victim state\u2019s ability to appropriately respond.169\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201c\u201cCyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the LOAC to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.\u201d30 The LOAC provides guidance on the use of force necessary to invoke a nation\u2019s right to self-defense.31 A certain level of response to a cyber act is dependent upon meeting the threshold of the \u201cuse of force\u201d under LOAC.32 Cyber activities have been characterized in three ways: (1) cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the state\u2019s ability to respond with a use of force; (2) cyber activities that are equivalent to the threshold to respond with a use of force, but do not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack;\u201d and (3) cyber activities that are equal to an armed attack.33 As defined above, cyberattacks that are considered armed attacks must produce consequences equivalent to a physical attack that causes destruction of property, grave injury, and death.34 \u201cAny computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.\u201d35\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 5)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C106.38470000000001%2C411.0226000000002%2C117.5057%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.21230000000001%2C411.0002%2C104.33330000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.9774000000001%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response.

considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply.22 Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering.23 However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.24\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.99180000000024%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0522000000004%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C411.0001%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0002%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0005000000003%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C410.9851000000002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00630000000024%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9378000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C149.64108%2C326.300863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply.

It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C106.38470000000001%2C411.0226000000002%2C117.5057%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.21230000000001%2C411.0002%2C104.33330000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.9774000000001%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response.

The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

an interview with Maj Zachary Smith\u2014 deputy chief of staff operations, headquarters United States Air Force (A3), Cyber Effects Divisionhe indicated there were five different main types of threats associated with cyberspace.162 The five types included: politically-minded hacking, crime, espionage, terrorism, and warfare.163 Accomplishing politically-minded hacking by non-state actors committing cyber acts is not necessarily reaching the threshold of a crime, but it will advance a political agenda.164 A crime committed through cyber acts is usually an attempt to exploit information for financial gain.165 Those actors committing espionage are generally connected to national systems online to gain access to information for adversaries of victim states.166 Terrorism represents individuals and groups of individuals seeking to commit acts of terror through cyberspace; though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can

international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply. Cyberattacks that create effects similar to a missile or bomb would meet the threshold of an armed attack and the principles under the law of war would apply.22 Even if the effects of a cyber operation do not reach the level of an armed attack, the activity could still fall under the principles of the law of war under non-forcible means and methods of war, such as information gathering.23 However, when the cyber operation does not fall within a category under the principles of the law of war, it is still used as a guide.24\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cThe Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare is a manual that applies international law onto cyber warfare. It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response. Evaluation of the cyber act itself should occur before any action in taken because of the implications of the victim states responsibilities under international law. The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts. Therefore, under international law, what factors could be considered in holding nation states or non-state actors accountable for malicious cyber acts?\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 2)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C418.7088%2C410.99180000000024%2C429.8298%5D%2C%5B75%2C405.683%2C411.0522000000004%2C416.804%5D%2C%5B75%2C392.6573%2C411.0001%2C403.7783%5D%2C%5B75%2C379.63160000000005%2C411.0002%2C391.429463%5D%2C%5B75%2C366.6059%2C411.0005000000003%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C410.9851000000002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00630000000024%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9378000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C149.64108%2C326.300863%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEffects of cyber operations are an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply.

It is crafted by scholars to provide clarity regarding the ambiguity of international law as it applies to cyber operations.48 The Tallinn Manual provides 95 black letter rules governing cyber acts and includes more defined guidance on the meanings of terms, such as armed attack in the context of cyberspace.49 It is important to note that the Tallinn Manual provides additional guidance and does not constitute international law. Rule 10 states that the \u201ccyber operation that constitutes a threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or that is in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, is unlawful.\u201d50 The use of force does not necessarily have to be executed by a state\u2019s armed forces, but rather it can be carried out by a state\u2019s intelligence agencies, by an individual, or by an entity that the state has contracted with and whose conduct could be attributed to the state.51 In the case of non-state actors, LOAC, and therefore Rule 10, does not apply unless the responsibility can be attributed to a state.52 One of the ongoing issues in determining appropriate, sanctioned action against a state or non-state actor in collusion with a state is that \u201ccyber operations falling below the use of force threshold are more difficult to characterize as a violation.\u201d53\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C106.38470000000001%2C411.0226000000002%2C117.5057%5D%2C%5B75%2C93.21230000000001%2C411.0002%2C104.33330000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C80.04%2C410.9774000000001%2C91.161%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThough technology can aid victim states in attributing hostile cyber acts, assessment of other considerations is necessary before achieving any response.

The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) Deskbook provides additional guidance on the categorization of \u201cuse of force\u201d and an \u201carmed attack\u201d in terms of the traditional kinetic attacks that have been used in past conflicts.11 These categories have been extended to include cyberspace operations that meet the threshold of \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attacks.\u201d12 However, LOAC does not adequately define the threshold of a hostile cyber act that meets the level of \u201cuse of force\u201d or an \u201carmed attack.\u201d To provide additional guidance in this area, a group of scholarly experts convened and produced the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare.13 Though the Tallinn Manual succeeded in providing additional considerations and guidance in the assessment of hostile cyber acts, the experts could not always come to a consensus on the criteria necessary to meet a threshold for \u201cuse of force\u201d and \u201carmed attack.\u201d The deficiency of law in this area creates an issue for victim states\u2019 ability to hold perpetrating states and non-state actors accountable for the employment of hostile cyber acts.

an important variable in determining if the principles of the law of war apply.

Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the LOAC to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.\u201d30 The LOAC provides guidance on the use of force necessary to invoke a nation\u2019s right to self-defense.31 A certain level of response to a cyber act is dependent upon meeting the threshold of the \u201cuse of force\u201d under LOAC.32 Cyber activities have been characterized in three ways: (1) cyber activities that fall below the threshold of the state\u2019s ability to respond with a use of force; (2) cyber activities that are equivalent to the threshold to respond with a use of force, but do not meet the threshold of an \u201carmed attack;\u201d and (3) cyber activities that are equal to an armed attack.33 As defined above, cyberattacks that are considered armed attacks must produce consequences equivalent to a physical attack that causes destruction of property, grave injury, and death.34 \u201cAny computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.\u201d35\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 5)", "Augustine, Zachary P. \u201cCyber Neutrality: A Textual Analysis of Traditional Just In Bello Neutrality Rules Through A Purpose-Based Lens.\u201d The Air Force Law Review 71 (2014): 69\u2013106. \u00a0Clark, David D. and Susan Landau. \u201cUntangling Attribution.\u201d In Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring Cyberattacks: Informing Strategies and Developing Options for US Policy, 25\u201340.

Another consideration under attribution is the limitations associated with technology and its use to provide information related to the responsibility of cyber acts. Technical attribution is limited by the structure of the Internet.

though terrorism can occur in cyberspace, it does not seem as prevalent as once thought and does not necessarily pose the most significant concern in cyberspace.167 Finally, cyber warfare is a threat that has very few examples because of the ambiguity in international law.168 Most cyber incidents can fit into one</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A26%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B75%2C588.0431%2C411.01260000000025%2C599.1641%5D%2C%5B75%2C574.4318999999999%2C411.03570000000065%2C585.5528999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C560.8207%2C254.00444999999996%2C572.618563%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">of these threat categories, but attribution is the most significant in the case of warfare because of the implications under international law and a victim state\u2019s ability to appropriately respond.169\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hill, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C437.6098%2C411.00390000000004%2C448.7308%5D%2C%5B75%2C424.36650000000003%2C411.0002%2C435.4875%5D%2C%5B75%2C411.1232%2C411.0002%2C422.921063%5D%2C%5B75%2C397.87980000000005%2C410.96889999999996%2C409.677663%5D%2C%5B75%2C384.6365%2C411.0225%2C395.7575%5D%2C%5B75%2C371.39320000000004%2C411.0002%2C383.19106300000004%5D%2C%5B75%2C358.1499%2C410.9388999999999%2C369.2709%5D%2C%5B75%2C344.9065%2C410.9598000000002%2C356.0275%5D%2C%5B75%2C331.6632%2C411.0002%2C342.7842%5D%2C%5B75%2C318.41990000000004%2C411.0002%2C330.217763%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C305.1766%2C411.0002%2C316.2976%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C291.9332%2C411.0049999999999%2C303.0542%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C278.6899%2C411.0002%2C290.48776300000003%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C265.44660000000005%2C410.9807999999999%2C276.5676%5D%2C%5B75.0001%2C252.20329999999998%2C411.000115%2C264.001163%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201c\u201cCyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards.

complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cNature of Cyberspace.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cNature of Cyberspace.

The International Criminal Court found that merely participating in an operation through financial support or equipping the organized armed group was insufficient to categorize the non-international armed conflict into an international armed conflict between states.107 Rather, the state had to play a role in the organizing, planning, and coordinating of the military objectives to internationalize the original non-international armed conflict between a victim state and an organized armed group of non-state actors.108 \u201cBy this standard, a state which identifies cyber targets for an organized armed group, provides it essential intelligence necessary to launch destructive attacks, or participates in the planning of the group\u2019s military cyber operations becomes a party to an international armed conflict with the target state.\u201d109\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute certainty.196 Therefore, victim states must rely on more than just technology to attribute cyber operations to a particular actor.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cA state can also be found responsible for a cyber act through the \u201cnonintervention principle,\u201d which refers to perpetrating states compelling other states\u2019 affairs.93 \u201cThe International Court of Justice has confirmed that the non-intervention principle is violated, for example, if a state provides financial support, training, a supply of weapons, intelligence, and logistic support to a terrorist or insurgent group operating in another state.\u201d94 Thus, under the non-intervention principle, cyber acts that are committed by non-state actors can be attributable to a state if the state is found to have supplied malware, trained the group on how to administer the malware, and provided support in committing the act. A state may not wittingly allow using its territory to violate other states\u2019 rights, whether the act is a traditional kinetic act or a cyber act originating in the perpetrating state\u2019s territory.95 For example, a state would be responsible for shutting down a cyber act committed by non-state actors if the act violated another state\u2019s rights. However, whether the state was responsible for the non-state actor\u2019s act, to begin with, is a question of attribution.96\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)", "\u201cMoreover, concepts key to proving a relationship between a state and nonstate actors have not been defined in the law of state responsibility. For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of \u201cacting under the direction or control of a state.\u201d140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 16)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNACYNRR7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A17%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87%2C366.6059%2C410.96980000000013%2C377.7269%5D%2C%5B75%2C353.5801%2C411.0002%2C364.7011%5D%2C%5B75%2C340.55440000000004%2C411.00012%2C352.352263%5D%2C%5B75%2C327.5287%2C410.9719000000001%2C338.6497%5D%2C%5B75%2C314.50300000000004%2C411.0002%2C325.624%5D%2C%5B75%2C301.4773%2C410.98180000000036%2C312.5983%5D%2C%5B75%2C288.4515%2C410.95650000000023%2C299.5725%5D%2C%5B75%2C275.42580000000004%2C411.0001%2C286.5468%5D%2C%5B75%2C262.4001%2C411.0005000000003%2C273.5211%5D%2C%5B75%2C249.37439999999998%2C411.0049000000003%2C260.49539999999996%5D%2C%5B75%2C236.34869999999998%2C410.9795000000004%2C248.14646299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C223.3229%2C410.97960000000023%2C234.4439%5D%2C%5B75%2C210.2972%2C411.0001%2C221.4182%5D%2C%5B75%2C197.2715%2C410.9992000000002%2C209.06936299999998%5D%2C%5B75%2C184.2458%2C411.0148000000004%2C195.3668%5D%2C%5B75%2C171.2201%2C411.0346000000002%2C182.3411%5D%2C%5B75%2C158.1943%2C411.0001%2C169.3153%5D%2C%5B75%2C145.1686%2C280.88912%2C156.96646299999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6ZQUMIV6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe difference between establishing state responsibility and a noninternational armed conflict becoming \u201cinternationalized\u201d is that the \u201csponsoring state exercises \u2018overall control\u2019 over an organized armed group.\u201d106 Therefore, though an organized armed group could still be considered a nonstate actor, a state supporting the organized armed group could attain complete control of the group\u2019s objectives, which would make the organized armed group an extension of that state\u2019s military objectives.

For example, one of the critical components of attributing a cyber act to a state that was committed by a non-state actor is the concept of \u201cacting under the direction or control of a state.\u201d140 An assessment must be conducted to ascertain that direction was provided by the state to a non-state actor, but this concept is not adequately defined under international law.141 This deficiency creates a problem for victim states attempting to hold a state responsible for the cyber acts committed by non-state actors. The degree of control becomes an important question in this assessment, and the International Court of Justice has provided that the state \u201cmust exercise effective control over the non-state actor\u201d to be attributable to a state.142 \u201cEffective control\u201d has not been defined; though, the term can imply a greater threshold than the general term of control.143 However, pertaining to instances where this term has come into question, the ability to satisfy this level of control is pursuant to the victim state\u2019s ability to prove that the non-state actor(s) were conducting cyber acts on behalf of the perpetrating state.144\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

The International Law Commission\u2019s \u201cDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts\u201d represents that states are responsible for \u201cinternationally wrongful acts\u201d perpetuated against victim states.87 These acts have two distinctions.88 First, the act has to breach an international obligation and second, the act has to be attributable to a state.89 If a state commits an act that breaches international law, the state must immediately stop the act or comply with their legal obligation, in the case of an omission, and \u201cmake full reparation of the injured state.\u201d90 Therefore, in the case of cyber acts, if the state breaches its international obligation, it is required to cease the cyber act immediately. Further, in the case of non-state actors acting on behalf of a state\u2014in which the cyber act committed by the non-state actors is attributable to that state\u2014 the state must follow the same guidelines. If the perpetrating state does not fulfill its duty under international law, victim states may take countermeasures, which are actions \u201ccontrary to the international obligations of [an] injured state vis-\u00e0-vis the responsible state if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act . . . to procure cessation and reparation.\u201d91 These countermeasures would not constitute an internationally wrongful act as long as they comply with the requirements for countermeasures under the international law of state responsibility.92\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 10)", "\u201cAttribution of cyber acts is the responsibility of victim states, and as evidenced in detail above, victim states are required to prove that cyber acts meet certain thresholds. Attributing acts to a perpetrating state must occur in order for international law to apply. Generally, the law provides states with the elements of proof that they must meet to attribute responsibility for a crime; however, as of the writing of international law today, there are not any definitive elements of proof for victim states to use in their efforts to prove accountability for cyber acts that do not meet the threshold of use of force or armed attack, or prove the accountability of a cyber act to a perpetrating state. Therefore, more research in the definition of specific terms under international law\u2014such as use of force and armed attack\u2014is critical if the attribution problem is to be solved. Furthermore, reaching an international collaboration of understanding in the operation of cyberspace is for not only states but also for explicitly addressing the issue of non-state actors perpetrating cyber acts against victim states.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 25)", "\u201cAttribution in the cyber domain can be especially complicated for these reasons: the inherent nature of cyberspace, the deficiency in international law as it relates specifically to cyberspace, the violation of a state\u2019s sovereignty and the ability to prove a state\u2019s responsibility, and the limitations of technology in attribution. The actor could commit a hostile cyber act in anonymity because of the way the domain is built. A determination of the actor and a thorough assessment of the activities are critical to the victim state\u2019s ability to respond to a violation of its sovereignty. For victim states to be able to respond to any violations of sovereignty, the ability to ascertain attribution of malicious cyber operations is essential.\u201d (Hill, 2019, p. 24)", "\u201cHowever, international law does not outline the evidentiary considerations necessary to assess attribution. \u201cInvestigations of cyberattacks among states are complicated by the absence of a uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.\u201d189 One of the complications specific to cyberspace is the levels of evidence that are necessary to attribute a cyber operation to a particular state.190 There may be three levels of evidence. The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace.

The first level is locating the physical equipment used in the cyber operation.191 The second level is the identification of the individual(s) behind the cyber operation.192 The third level is connecting individual(s) to a state, and proving that the individual(s) were acting on behalf of the state is needed to attribute the cyber operation to a state.193 With technological advances and forensic tools, it seems plausible to determine with accuracy the first level of evidence necessary to attribute a cyber operation to an adversary. However, technology can only assist with the other two levels of evidence. This is the nature of cyberspace. Cyberspace allows adversaries to assume aliases, hide behind various technology, and use other computers to carry out their goals.194 The International Court of Justice has alluded to the need for \u201cclear evidence\u201d in cases of determining responsibility of cyber acts committed by non-state actors; however, the International Court of Justice did not explain any further as to the meaning or threshold of \u201cclear evidence.\u201d195 Moreover, the standard of proof does not have to meet the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d nor does it require absolute
