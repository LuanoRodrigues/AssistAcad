Hence, Merck could reasonably assume that such an exclusion clause would only apply to \"traditional forms of warfare.\"17 As a result, Merck prevailed, and the insurer was required to pay the requested amount.\u201d (Brunner, 2022, p. 184)", "\u201cCyber insurance policies may, at first glance, not be particularly related to international law.

That may be the case particularly if the national court judgment is not only based on a \"political\" attribution statement made by a State.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22186%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner, 2022, p. 186</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ZA6HYTV%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22190%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B155%2C336.03%2C431.71360000000004%2C345.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C324.03%2C431.97599199999985%2C333.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C312.22999999999996%2C432.2578%2C321.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C300.03%2C432.23199999999997%2C309.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C288.03%2C431.8012%2C297.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C276.03%2C431.5916%2C285.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C262.53%2C429.9851999999999%2C273.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C252.03%2C431.03919999999994%2C261.23%5D%2C%5B132%2C240.03%2C432.613%2C249.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C228.03%2C433.1792%2C237.23000000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22190%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIt would be better, therefore, if the insurer was obliged to provide additional evidence, in particular, in a court proceeding, such as through reports of cybersecurity companies containing concrete evidence or its own investigations, to back up the claims of the State.

Some authors, for example, have called for lowering the threshold of 'effective control'-as determined by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case and reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocidecase34 -to 'overall control'-as determined by the ICTY in Tadic35 -or even 'virtual control,' which, essentially, is a proposal to shift the burden of proving control to the State having allegedly provided financial or other assistance to a private group.36 States, on the other hand, have not been very specific regarding the necessary threshold, although Brazil, the Netherlands, and Norway have noted in their position on international law applicable to cyberspace that the necessary threshold remains 'effective control'-the most stringent threshold of control.37\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22187%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner, 2022, p. 187</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ZA6HYTV%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22191%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B155%2C569.0300000000001%2C432.276%2C578.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B132%2C557.0300000000001%2C431.0870141%2C566.23%5D%2C%5B132%2C545.0300000000001%2C431.803%2C554.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B132%2C533.0300000000001%2C432.613%2C542.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B132%2C521.0300000000001%2C431.65310000000005%2C530.23%5D%2C%5B132%2C509.03%2C431.2974%2C518.03%5D%2C%5B131.99970000000002%2C497.03%2C432.2578%2C506.13%5D%2C%5B132%2C485.03%2C432.25000000000006%2C494.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C473.247%2C146.69879999999998%2C481.347%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22191%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber insurance policies may, at first glance, not be particularly related to international law.

A national court judgment, if not solely based on vague attribution statements made by States but which instead is based on concrete and sufficient evidence, may be persuasive authority also for international courts and tribunals to establish attribution in a cyber case.

Ace, the Superior Court of New Jersey noted that the parties disputed \"the issue of whether the facts show conclusively . . . that the malware, called 'NotPetya,' was an instrument of the Russian government.\"15 While the insurer argued that there was overwhelming evidence of Russian State origin, Merck argued that \"there [were] significant facts which show it was not an official State action, but rather ... a form of ransomware.\"16 In the end, the court did not focus on this evidentiary question, but rather found that the \"hostile or warlike acts exclusion\" clause did not apply in this case because the insurer had failed to clarify that cyber operations could fall under this clause. Hence, Merck could reasonably assume that such an exclusion clause would only apply to \"traditional forms of warfare.\"17 As a result, Merck prevailed, and the insurer was required to pay the requested amount.\u201d (Brunner, 2022, p. 184)", "\u201cThis commentary does not question that the interpretation of (cyber) insurance policies is regulated under private law. Thus, public international law, and in particular the rules of attribution under the International Law Commission Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles)30 and evidentiary rules related to attribution, is not directly applicable to disputes arising between private parties in a national court proceeding. However, given the particular uncertainty regarding the questions of attribution and how they are applicable to cyber operations, national court judgments could potentially be considered as persuasive authority in future judgments rendered by the International Court ofJustice or another international tribunal having jurisdiction over the attribution of cyber operations to the State. At the same time, the rules of attribution and accompanying evidentiary rules under international law may also be indicative for national courts in their assessment whether a cyber operation is attributable to a State. That may be the case particularly if the national court judgment is not only based on a \"political\" attribution statement made by a State.\u201d (Brunner, 2022, p. 186)", "\u201cMondelez, a multinational food corporation was also heavily affected by the NotPetya cyber incident. According to the Financial Times, 1,700 of Mondelez' servers and 24,000 laptops were rendered \"permanently dysfunctional\" by NotPetya.18 In January 2019, Mondelez filed a lawsuit against its insurer, Zurich Insurance, because Zurich refused to pay out insurance in the amount of $100 million.19 Mondelez argued that the NotPetya cyber incident was covered by the insurance with Zurich. Zurich's counterargument-similar to that of the insurer in the Merck case-was that NotPetya constitutes a war or hostile act which would be excluded from insurance.20 The case was pending before an Illinois State Court for a long time, before the parties finally reached a settlement at the end of October 2022.21\u201d (Brunner, 2022, p. 184)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ZA6HYTV%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22190%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B155%2C336.03%2C431.71360000000004%2C345.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C324.03%2C431.97599199999985%2C333.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C312.22999999999996%2C432.2578%2C321.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C300.03%2C432.23199999999997%2C309.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C288.03%2C431.8012%2C297.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B132%2C276.03%2C431.5916%2C285.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C262.53%2C429.9851999999999%2C273.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C252.03%2C431.03919999999994%2C261.23%5D%2C%5B132%2C240.03%2C432.613%2C249.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C228.03%2C433.1792%2C237.23000000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22190%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIt would be better, therefore, if the insurer was obliged to provide additional evidence, in particular, in a court proceeding, such as through reports of cybersecurity companies containing concrete evidence or its own investigations, to back up the claims of the State.

Thus, public international law, and in particular the rules of attribution under the International Law Commission Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles)30 and evidentiary rules related to attribution, is not directly applicable to disputes arising between private parties in a national court proceeding. However, given the particular uncertainty regarding the questions of attribution and how they are applicable to cyber operations, national court judgments could potentially be considered as persuasive authority in future judgments rendered by the International Court ofJustice or another international tribunal having jurisdiction over the attribution of cyber operations to the State. At the same time, the rules of attribution and accompanying evidentiary rules under international law may also be indicative for national courts in their assessment whether a cyber operation is attributable to a State. That may be the case particularly if the national court judgment is not only based on a \"political\" attribution statement made by a State.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22186%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner, 2022, p. 186</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F9ZA6HYTV%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22184%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B154%2C495.83%2C431.2377000000001%2C505.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C483.83%2C431.71360000000004%2C493.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C471.83%2C430.97499999999997%2C480.83%5D%2C%5B132%2C459.83%2C431.4%2C469.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C447.83%2C431.29619999999994%2C459.1225%5D%2C%5B132%2C435.83%2C432.02840000000003%2C445.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C423.83%2C432.654%2C435.2225%5D%2C%5B132%2C411.83%2C432.7765%2C421.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C399.83%2C431.48019999999997%2C408.83%5D%2C%5B132%2C387.83%2C432.4355%2C396.93%5D%2C%5B132%2C375.83%2C432.7765%2C385.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C363.83%2C431.10819999999995%2C375.1225%5D%2C%5B132%2C351.83%2C430.9208999999999%2C361.03%5D%2C%5B132%2C339.83%2C276.17499999999995%2C348.83%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMondelez, a multinational food corporation was also heavily affected by the NotPetya cyber incident.

Zurich's counterargument-similar to that of the insurer in the Merck case-was that NotPetya constitutes a war or hostile act which would be excluded from insurance.20 The case was pending before an Illinois State Court for a long time, before the parties finally reached a settlement at the end of October 2022.21\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSLTGCATF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22184%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Brunner, 2022, p. 184</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Isabella Brunner", "date": "2022", "journal": "New York University Journal of International Law & Politics", "title": "INSURANCE POLICIES AND THE ATTRIBUTION OF CYBER OPERATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW: A COMMENTARY", "abstract": "Cyber insurance policies are becoming increasingly important in the face of growing cross-border cyber operations and the damages they can cause worldwide.
