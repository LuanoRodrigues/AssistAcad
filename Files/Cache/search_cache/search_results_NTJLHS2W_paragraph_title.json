Direction means guidance over the entity that commits the wrongful act in the sense of the state taking the lead. In both cases, the perpetrator implements or follows the state\u2019s decision to commit the particular wrongful act and her will is subordinated to the will of the state. Regarding the criterion of control, it should be exercised over the specific conduct in question or over the operation in the course of which unlawful acts are committed and, as the ICJ has repeatedly said, it should be \u2018effective\u2019. Although the Court has never defined \u2018effective\u2019, it is deemed to amount to domination over the act.51\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 954)", "\u201cAmplifying the level of control a state needs to exercise over organized non-state actors in cyberspace, and moving away from \u2018effective control\u2019, can assist significantly in achieving these aims. The \u2018overall control\u2019 standard introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is particularly apposite in this regard. \u2018Overall control\u2019 is established when a state equips, finances, coordinates or helps in the general planning of the activities of an organized group, short of issuing specific instructions.84 From the ICTY\u2019s judgment, it transpires that the \u2018overall control\u2019 standard applies to all organized groups and is not restricted to armed groups only; whereas, more recent legal commentary views \u2018overall control\u2019 not only as a criterion for the classification of armed conflicts but also as an attribution criterion.85\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 962)", "\u201cMoving on to the second modality of attribution, a functional link is established when an entity is empowered by a state to exercise governmental authority.44 The delegation of authority can be specific or general depending on how it is stipulated in domestic law. For example, if the security of a governmental network is contracted out to a private company, the contract between the government and the private company would amount to delegation if executive delegation is permitted by domestic law; otherwise, what would amount to delegation is the general authorizing legislation. In relation to this, it should be noted that judicial authorizations \u2013 for example, authorizations to conduct data searches \u2013 do not constitute delegation; they only certify the lawfulness of the search. With regard to the second prong of the test, what constitutes a governmental function varies, with the exception perhaps of certain intrinsically governmental functions such as defence. It all depends on the nature and purpose of the activity, the overall context within which such functions are exercised and the state\u2019s political identity. For instance, if a private cyber security company is authorized to defend the state against cyber attacks, that would be a governmental function, but not when it is authorized to defend its own property from cyber intrusions. Would, however, ransomware attacks, or cybercrime constitute governmental functions if they support a state\u2019s economy or if they are part of a state\u2019s governance tools? Is espionage a governmental function?45 With regard to espionage, one perhaps needs to distinguish political from industrial espionage, but even industrial espionage can be linked to core governmental functions such as the economy or national security. That said, and notwithstanding how such activities are characterized, it is highly unlikely that a state will explicitly authorize an entity to perform such activities \u2013 rendering Article 5 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) inapplicable. Equally, Article 5 of the ARSIWA will not apply to attributions performed by private companies because there is no authorization, even if attribution is deemed to be a sovereign prerogative or touches upon a state\u2019s foreign relations. Article 5 of the ARSIWA may, however, play a more prominent role if implicit authorization is accepted, i.e. authorization derived from informal relations and practices, but, as was said, it requires formal authorization, which reduces its operational functionality.\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 953)", "\u201cDe facto organs are state instrumentalities. They include entities, groups or individuals who are completely dependent on a state and over whom the state exercises control \u2018in all fields\u2019.41 From an examination of existing jurisprudence, it transpires that if an entity has been created by a state, operates on behalf of that state and has no real autonomy in decision-making, it is a de facto organ of that state. Contracted-out cyber groups or companies may also be included, but that would depend on the terms of the contract and how it is executed, in particular whether the outsourced tasks are closely linked to the state such as security tasks, and whether their delivery is controlled by the state. That said, proving such a close relationship is particularly difficult and, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated, it will be quite \u2018exceptional\u2019 to qualify entities as de facto organs.42 For example, the US government characterized three North Korean hacker groups including the \u2018Lazarus Group\u2019 as \u2018agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities of the Government of North Korea\u2019,43 which in principle alludes to the attribution criteria discussed here, but it provided no evidence to substantiate the claim.\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 952)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F8LL5K3G5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22959%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B58%2C589.1966%2C394.00010000000003%2C598.3565%5D%2C%5B58.00399999999996%2C576.6946%2C393.9810000000004%2C585.3111%5D%2C%5B58.00399999999996%2C564.1926000000001%2C394.00010000000043%2C573.3565%5D%2C%5B58.004099999999966%2C551.6946%2C393.99060000000026%2C560.3111%5D%2C%5B58.004099999999966%2C539.1926000000001%2C181.89370000000002%2C548.3565%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22959%22%7D%7D\">\u201cElsewhere, the Court used formulations such as \u2018sufficient\u2019 or \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence;72 or variations of \u2018on a balance of probabilities\u2019, \u2018in all probability\u2019, \u2018consistent with the probabilities\u2019 and \u2018with a high degree of probability\u2019.73 As far as the Tallinn Manual is concerned, it relegates this issue to judicial processes and admonishes states to act reasonably in the circumstances.74\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22959%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 959</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F8LL5K3G5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22954%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B57.6959%2C451.69059999999996%2C384.23940000000033%2C460.30709999999993%5D%2C%5B48.1959%2C439.18859999999995%2C384.1919%2C447.8050999999999%5D%2C%5B48.1959%2C426.68659999999994%2C384.18840000000046%2C435.8565%5D%2C%5B48.20190000000001%2C414.1946%2C384.1985%2C423.3565%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C401.6946%2C384.22700000000015%2C410.31109999999995%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C389.19259999999997%2C384.23555000000033%2C397.80909999999994%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C376.69059999999996%2C384.1985%2C385.30709999999993%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C364.18859999999995%2C384.1795000000001%2C372.8050999999999%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C351.68659999999994%2C384.2355500000001%2C360.3030999999999%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C339.18459999999993%2C384.23650000000004%2C347.8010999999999%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C326.6825999999999%2C384.2032500000002%2C335.2990999999999%5D%2C%5B48.202499999999986%2C314.1805999999999%2C285.4843%2C323.3565%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22954%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, according to the third modality, an agency link is established when a state instructs or directs a person to commit a wrongful act or when the state exercises control over the wrongful act.49 Instructions imply orders which should be given in relation to each specific act that constitutes a violation of international law50 and should be carried out as such by those instructed. Direction means guidance over the entity that commits the wrongful act in the sense of the state taking the lead. In both cases, the perpetrator implements or follows the state\u2019s decision to commit the particular wrongful act and her will is subordinated to the will of the state. Regarding the criterion of control, it should be exercised over the specific conduct in question or over the operation in the course of which unlawful acts are committed and, as the ICJ has repeatedly said, it should be \u2018effective\u2019.

The \u2018overall control\u2019 standard introduced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is particularly apposite in this regard. \u2018Overall control\u2019 is established when a state equips, finances, coordinates or helps in the general planning of the activities of an organized group, short of issuing specific instructions.84 From the ICTY\u2019s judgment, it transpires that the \u2018overall control\u2019 standard applies to all organized groups and is not restricted to armed groups only; whereas, more recent legal commentary views \u2018overall control\u2019 not only as a criterion for the classification of armed conflicts but also as an attribution criterion.85\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22962%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 962</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F8LL5K3G5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22952%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B57.704200000000014%2C239.19059999999996%2C384.2372500000003%2C247.80709999999996%5D%2C%5B48.204200000000014%2C226.68859999999995%2C384.19759999999997%2C235.8565%5D%2C%5B48.201599999999985%2C214.19459999999998%2C384.17765000000014%2C222.81109999999998%5D%2C%5B48.201599999999985%2C201.69259999999997%2C384.22610000000003%2C210.30909999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22952%22%7D%7D\">\u201cMoving on to the second modality of attribution, a functional link is established when an entity is empowered by a state to exercise governmental authority.44 The delegation of authority can be specific or general depending on how it is stipulated in domestic law.

In relation to this, it should be noted that judicial authorizations \u2013 for example, authorizations to conduct data searches \u2013 do not constitute delegation; they only certify the lawfulness of the search. With regard to the second prong of the test, what constitutes a governmental function varies, with the exception perhaps of certain intrinsically governmental functions such as defence. It all depends on the nature and purpose of the activity, the overall context within which such functions are exercised and the state\u2019s political identity. For instance, if a private cyber security company is authorized to defend the state against cyber attacks, that would be a governmental function, but not when it is authorized to defend its own property from cyber intrusions. Would, however, ransomware attacks, or cybercrime constitute governmental functions if they support a state\u2019s economy or if they are part of a state\u2019s governance tools? Is espionage a governmental function?45 With regard to espionage, one perhaps needs to distinguish political from industrial espionage, but even industrial espionage can be linked to core governmental functions such as the economy or national security. That said, and notwithstanding how such activities are characterized, it is highly unlikely that a state will explicitly authorize an entity to perform such activities \u2013 rendering Article 5 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA) inapplicable. Equally, Article 5 of the ARSIWA will not apply to attributions performed by private companies because there is no authorization, even if attribution is deemed to be a sovereign prerogative or touches upon a state\u2019s foreign relations. Article 5 of the ARSIWA may, however, play a more prominent role if implicit authorization is accepted, i.e. authorization derived from informal relations and practices, but, as was said, it requires formal authorization, which reduces its operational functionality.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22953%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 953</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F8LL5K3G5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22952%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B57.7%2C426.6966%2C384.23115000000035%2C435.31309999999996%5D%2C%5B48.2%2C414.1946%2C384.2254500000002%2C422.81109999999995%5D%2C%5B48.2%2C401.69259999999997%2C384.20695000000046%2C410.8565%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C389.1946%2C384.26965000000024%2C397.81109999999995%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C376.69259999999997%2C384.22690000000006%2C385.30909999999994%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C364.19059999999996%2C384.18890000000005%2C372.80709999999993%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C351.68859999999995%2C384.16895000000017%2C360.3050999999999%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C339.18659999999994%2C384.2069500000003%2C347.8030999999999%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C326.68459999999993%2C384.1813000000007%2C335.3010999999999%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C314.1825999999999%2C384.15090000000026%2C322.7990999999999%5D%2C%5B48.20240000000001%2C301.6805999999999%2C384.17690000000016%2C310.8565%5D%2C%5B48.199899999999985%2C289.1946%2C384.2054000000004%2C297.81109999999995%5D%2C%5B48.199899999999985%2C276.69259999999997%2C384.18975000000006%2C285.8565%5D%2C%5B48.204200000000014%2C264.1946%2C384.21920000000017%2C272.81109999999995%5D%2C%5B48.204200000000014%2C251.69259999999997%2C138.2927%2C260.30909999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22952%22%7D%7D\">\u201cDe facto organs are state instrumentalities. They include entities, groups or individuals who are completely dependent on a state and over whom the state exercises control \u2018in all fields\u2019.41 From an examination of existing jurisprudence, it transpires that if an entity has been created by a state, operates on behalf of that state and has no real autonomy in decision-making, it is a de facto organ of that state. Contracted-out cyber groups or companies may also be included, but that would depend on the terms of the contract and how it is executed, in particular whether the outsourced tasks are closely linked to the state such as security tasks, and whether their delivery is controlled by the state. That said, proving such a close relationship is particularly difficult and, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated, it will be quite \u2018exceptional\u2019 to qualify entities as de facto organs.42 For example, the US government characterized three North Korean hacker groups including the \u2018Lazarus Group\u2019 as \u2018agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities of the Government of North Korea\u2019,43 which in principle alludes to the attribution criteria discussed here, but it provided no evidence to substantiate the claim.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22952%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 952</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Nicholas Tsagourias, Michael Farrell", "date": "2020", "journal": "European Journal of International Law", "title": "Cyber Attribution: Technical and Legal Approaches and Challenges", "abstract": "Considering the role of attribution in the law of state responsibility, this article examines the technical and international law methodologies and determinants used when attributing malicious cyber activities falling below the use-of-force threshold to a state, and identifies the challenges that arise which lead to responsibility gaps.

Direction means guidance over the entity that commits the wrongful act in the sense of the state taking the lead. In both cases, the perpetrator implements or follows the state\u2019s decision to commit the particular wrongful act and her will is subordinated to the will of the state. Regarding the criterion of control, it should be exercised over the specific conduct in question or over the operation in the course of which unlawful acts are committed and, as the ICJ has repeatedly said, it should be \u2018effective\u2019. Although the Court has never defined \u2018effective\u2019, it is deemed to amount to domination over the act.51\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 954)", "\u201cDe facto organs are state instrumentalities.

Direction means guidance over the entity that commits the wrongful act in the sense of the state taking the lead. In both cases, the perpetrator implements or follows the state\u2019s decision to commit the particular wrongful act and her will is subordinated to the will of the state. Regarding the criterion of control, it should be exercised over the specific conduct in question or over the operation in the course of which unlawful acts are committed and, as the ICJ has repeatedly said, it should be \u2018effective\u2019.

State attribution has been even more challenging for the same reasons but also because of the serious political and legal consequences that attribution or misattribution may trigger. However, the initial rarity of state attributions gradually gave way to ever more frequent attribution claims as a result of improvements in attribution capabilities coupled with the changing attitudes of states towards state attribution.8 Although we are not going to examine all of these attribution claims in this section, we will highlight certain important features they reveal about the attribution process which will provide some of the context to the discussion that follows.\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 944)", "\u201cThirdly, it should be recalled that the determinants of Article 8 of the ARSIWA were developed in an era when states created armed groups to fight proxy wars and these groups were dependent on states for direction and resources, such as weapons. The descriptors in Article 8 of the ARSIWA thus reflect such unequal and vertical relations between states and non-state actors. However, the circumstances where Article 8 of the ARSIWA is called upon to be applied have changed and more so in cyberspace. Cyberspace offers a particularly facilitative environment for non-state actors to emerge and operate, and many non-state actors in cyberspace are often self-sufficient, autonomous and pursue their goals either independently from states or in alignment with them, but such alignment can be, variously, formal or informal, vertical or horizontal, continuous or ad hoc, attached or detached.80 In this context, states may just offer political or ideological direction and support to non-state actors rather than material support.\u201d (Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 962)", "\u201cAttribution in the law of state responsibility is a normative \u2013 not a factual or technical \u2013 process whose function is to assign a wrongful act to a state in order to engage its responsibility.35 For this reason, its determinants are moulded by how the state is defined, which in the law of state responsibility is reduced to the structures, entities and functions that make up its legal-political order. This makes the legal determinants of attribution quite narrow, requiring an identifiable, direct and close link between a state and an entity or between a state and the impugned conduct; a link that overrides the latter\u2019s independent existence.

State attribution has been even more challenging for the same reasons but also because of the serious political and legal consequences that attribution or misattribution may trigger. However, the initial rarity of state attributions gradually gave way to ever more frequent attribution claims as a result of improvements in attribution capabilities coupled with the changing attitudes of states towards state attribution.8 Although we are not going to examine all of these attribution claims in this section, we will highlight certain important features they reveal about the attribution process which will provide some of the context to the discussion that follows.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22944%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Tsagourias e Farrell, 2020, p. 944</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F8LL5K3G5%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22961%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A20%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B67.5%2C222.1966%2C393.94755000000015%2C230.8131%5D%2C%5B58%2C209.69459999999998%2C394.0026500000003%2C218.31109999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C197.19259999999997%2C394.00360000000046%2C205.80909999999997%5D%2C%5B58%2C184.69059999999996%2C394.0330500000004%2C193.30709999999996%5D%2C%5B58%2C172.18859999999995%2C393.9656000000003%2C180.80509999999995%5D%2C%5B58%2C159.68659999999994%2C393.99600000000004%2C168.30309999999994%5D%2C%5B58%2C147.18459999999993%2C394.00550000000004%2C155.80109999999993%5D%2C%5B58%2C134.68259999999992%2C394.0150000000004%2C143.29909999999992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNTJLHS2W%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22961%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThirdly, it should be recalled that the determinants of Article 8 of the ARSIWA were developed in an era when states created armed groups to fight proxy wars and these groups were dependent on states for direction and resources, such as weapons.

However, the circumstances where Article 8 of the ARSIWA is called upon to be applied have changed and more so in cyberspace.
