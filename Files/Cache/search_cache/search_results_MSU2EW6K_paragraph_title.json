Information on nationalism or ideological salience among private actors in cyberspace can be inferred through existing polling data and clarified through intelligence tradecraft and even additional social science research. Imputing rough approximations for these variables should give investigators a clearer idea about which states are (1) predisposed to outsourcing and (2) may have had the means, motive, and opportunity to do so in a recent attack. Most importantly, because gathering post-attack forensic evidence is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive\u2014not to mention the fact that private firms are often reluctant to disclose breaches when they are detected for fear of looking weak on data security\u2014this framework should allow us to narrow the list of suspects by process of elimination without knowing any of the technical details of the case.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMSU2EW6K%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2016, p. 224</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FDZE7TYWZ%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B100%2C351.60310453125%2C497.61623000000003%2C357.69536%5D%2C%5B100%2C333.45310453125%2C487.8703400000002%2C339.54536%5D%2C%5B100%2C315.30310453124997%2C503.6620500000002%2C321.39536%5D%2C%5B100%2C297.15310453125%2C498.1553400000002%2C303.24536%5D%2C%5B100%2C279.00310453125%2C478.6967800000001%2C287.7421382%5D%2C%5B100%2C260.60496000000006%2C490.83374%2C271.76116%5D%2C%5B100%2C242.45496000000003%2C498.2863500000002%2C253.61116000000004%5D%2C%5B100%2C224.55310453125003%2C504.33118000000013%2C230.64536000000004%5D%2C%5B100%2C206.40310453125002%2C506.02364000000006%2C212.49536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C188.25310453125002%2C511.94813000000016%2C194.34536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C170.10310453125%2C509.1010000000002%2C176.19536000000002%5D%2C%5B100%2C151.95310453125%2C511.5234200000003%2C158.04536000000002%5D%2C%5B100%2C133.80310453125%2C483.8362000000002%2C139.89536%5D%2C%5B100%2C115.65310453125001%2C254.27742000000003%2C121.74536%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMSU2EW6K%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber attacks will continue to pose problems for national security for the foreseeable future, and the proliferation of Internet access, which partially levels the playing field between states and individuals in the cyber domain, means the threat of patriotic (or otherwise non-state) CNA will no doubt increase should no developments intercede to alter our current trajectory.23 The framework espoused in this paper proposes a method of differentiating between plausible and truthful deniability when non-state attacks do occur. Specifically, when the permissive conditions outlined above overlap with forensic indicators in a given instance, we have a match. This adds to the persuasive content of attribution reports while also reducing the likelihood of false positives. Readers should also be optimistic because the conditions under which states should rationally choose to delegate are narrower than commonly envisioned, which implies that these types of cyber conflicts are fewer, more controlled, and that the principals behind them can be held accountable.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FMSU2EW6K%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Canfil, 2016, p. 224</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Justin Key Canfil", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "HONING CYBER ATTRIBUTION: A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING FOREIGN STATE COMPLICITY", "abstract": "Concerns about state-directed cyber intrusions have grown increasingly prevalent in recent years.
