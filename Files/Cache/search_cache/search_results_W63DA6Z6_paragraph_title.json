The novel characteristics of cyber-attacks make the existing standards of proof and degrees of control required to establish attribution extremely difficult to determine. As a result, attribution is regarded by many scholars as one of the most significant and immediate practical obstacles to resolving the legal uncertainty surrounding this emerging issue.249 This Article has analyzed the different approaches to cyber-attribution and proposed a model whereby attribution requirements are linked with the state\u2019s response to a cyber-incident. This approach leverages existing international law, discourages states from pursuing retaliatory responses, and incentivizes host states to assist the victims of cyber-attack in identifying the perpetrators. Issues remain regarding compulsory jurisdiction and enforcement of international tribunal decisions on these issues. Furthermore, the applicability of the law on countermeasures to cyber-attack requires further research. However, the approach described represents a viable way to address existing concerns regarding attribution. If the international community adopts this model and it proves successful, that may enable a greater focus on other impediments to effectively dealing with the problem of cyber-attack.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 568)", "\u201cCyber-attacks have properties that make them quite different from existing modes of warfare, and it remains uncertain precisely how public international law should deal with this new mode of attack.6 In particular, it is unclear whether existing legal rules are suitably equipped to deal with the novel characteristics of cyberwarfare, or instead, if and to what degree new rules need to be developed.7 The result is a raft of partly legal and partly technical questions, generally without clear answers. Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22568%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A33%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.5%2C449.659%2C473.98107155000014%2C460.4%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C436.6594%2C473.9580713499998%2C447.4004%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C423.6598%2C473.9948716699999%2C434.4008%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C410.66020000000003%2C473.9983216999999%2C421.4012%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C397.66060000000004%2C473.9948716699998%2C408.40160000000003%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C384.66100000000006%2C473.9695714500002%2C395.40200000000004%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C371.66140000000007%2C473.95807135%2C382.40240000000006%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C358.659%2C473.96661745%2C369.40280000000007%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C345.6594%2C473.9804175699998%2C356.4004%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C332.6598%2C473.9861676199998%2C343.4008%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C319.66020000000003%2C473.9942176899998%2C330.4012%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C306.66060000000004%2C473.99766771999987%2C317.40160000000003%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C293.66100000000006%2C473.9746675199999%2C304.40200000000004%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C280.66140000000007%2C473.9827175899996%2C291.40240000000006%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C267.6618000000001%2C473.9746675200001%2C278.40280000000007%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C254.6622000000001%2C473.9942176899999%2C265.4032000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C241.6626000000001%2C473.99191766999974%2C252.40360000000013%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C228.66300000000012%2C473.9942176899998%2C239.40400000000014%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C215.66340000000014%2C473.99421768999986%2C226.40440000000015%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C202.66380000000015%2C473.95166732000007%2C213.40480000000017%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C189.66420000000016%2C473.96316741999993%2C200.40520000000018%5D%2C%5B137.99924602000002%2C176.66460000000018%2C348.33607502%2C187.4056000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22568%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis Article has outlined some of the major legal issues in relation to cyber-attacks, focusing particularly on the question of attribution.

of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense</span> <span

self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)", "\u201cFor the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state. In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22537%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22553%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.49914761999995%2C487.06215000000003%2C473.98596922%2C497.80315%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C474.06255000000004%2C473.95721896999993%2C484.80355000000003%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C461.06295000000006%2C473.96871906999985%2C471.80395000000004%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C448.05899999999997%2C473.96198699999997%2C458.80435000000006%5D%2C%5B137.99921561000002%2C435.05899999999997%2C473.9777533499999%2C445.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C422.0594%2C473.9858034199999%2C432.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C409.05899999999997%2C473.96195499999993%2C419.8008%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C396.0594%2C473.98610520999995%2C406.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C383.0598%2C473.9803551599999%2C393.8008%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22553%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22554%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138%2C661.6591000000001%2C473.9616534%2C672.4001000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C648.6595000000001%2C473.95475333999957%2C659.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C635.6599000000001%2C473.97545351999975%2C646.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C622.6603000000001%2C473.99500368999975%2C633.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C609.6607000000001%2C473.99845371999976%2C620.4017000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C596.6611000000001%2C473.9950036899998%2C607.4021000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C583.6615000000002%2C473.9754535199998%2C594.4025000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C570.6619000000002%2C473.9720034900001%2C581.4029000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C557.6623000000002%2C473.9409532199999%2C568.4033000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C544.6627000000002%2C444.82270001999984%2C555.4037000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22554%22%7D%7D\">against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cFor the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state. In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22537%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22553%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.49914761999995%2C487.06215000000003%2C473.98596922%2C497.80315%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C474.06255000000004%2C473.95721896999993%2C484.80355000000003%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C461.06295000000006%2C473.96871906999985%2C471.80395000000004%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C448.05899999999997%2C473.96198699999997%2C458.80435000000006%5D%2C%5B137.99921561000002%2C435.05899999999997%2C473.9777533499999%2C445.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C422.0594%2C473.9858034199999%2C432.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C409.05899999999997%2C473.96195499999993%2C419.8008%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C396.0594%2C473.98610520999995%2C406.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C383.0598%2C473.9803551599999%2C393.8008%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22553%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22554%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138%2C661.6591000000001%2C473.9616534%2C672.4001000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C648.6595000000001%2C473.95475333999957%2C659.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C635.6599000000001%2C473.97545351999975%2C646.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C622.6603000000001%2C473.99500368999975%2C633.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C609.6607000000001%2C473.99845371999976%2C620.4017000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C596.6611000000001%2C473.9950036899998%2C607.4021000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C583.6615000000002%2C473.9754535199998%2C594.4025000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C570.6619000000002%2C473.9720034900001%2C581.4029000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C557.6623000000002%2C473.9409532199999%2C568.4033000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C544.6627000000002%2C444.82270001999984%2C555.4037000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22554%22%7D%7D\">against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cFor the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state. In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22535%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.5%2C386.05899999999997%2C473.9983216999997%2C396.79999999999995%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C373.0594%2C473.98682159999976%2C383.80039999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22535%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber-attacks have properties that make them quite different from existing modes of warfare, and it remains uncertain precisely</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22536%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138%2C661.6591000000001%2C473.9754215000002%2C672.4001000000001%5D%2C%5B138%2C648.6591000000001%2C473.9800765000001%2C659.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00005496%2C635.6595000000001%2C473.98697656000013%2C646.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00005496%2C622.6599000000001%2C473.94097615999976%2C633.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00005496%2C609.6591000000001%2C473.97988449999957%2C620.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99986296%2C596.6595000000001%2C473.9775844799998%2C607.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99986296%2C583.6599000000001%2C473.99828465999974%2C594.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99986296%2C570.6603000000001%2C473.97528446%2C581.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99986296%2C557.659%2C473.9789598499997%2C568.4017000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00008832%2C544.6591000000001%2C473.96736919999967%2C555.4004%5D%2C%5B137.99884776%2C531.6595000000001%2C473.97426925999986%2C542.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B137.99884776%2C518.6599000000001%2C291.06517876%2C529.4009000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22536%22%7D%7D\">how public international law should deal with this new mode of attack.6 In particular, it is unclear whether existing legal rules are suitably equipped to deal with the novel characteristics of cyberwarfare, or instead, if and to what degree new rules need to be developed.7 The result is a raft of partly legal and partly technical questions, generally without clear answers.

Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22537%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22553%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.49914761999995%2C487.06215000000003%2C473.98596922%2C497.80315%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C474.06255000000004%2C473.95721896999993%2C484.80355000000003%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C461.06295000000006%2C473.96871906999985%2C471.80395000000004%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C448.05899999999997%2C473.96198699999997%2C458.80435000000006%5D%2C%5B137.99921561000002%2C435.05899999999997%2C473.9777533499999%2C445.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C422.0594%2C473.9858034199999%2C432.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C409.05899999999997%2C473.96195499999993%2C419.8008%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C396.0594%2C473.98610520999995%2C406.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C383.0598%2C473.9803551599999%2C393.8008%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22553%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22554%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138%2C661.6591000000001%2C473.9616534%2C672.4001000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C648.6595000000001%2C473.95475333999957%2C659.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C635.6599000000001%2C473.97545351999975%2C646.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C622.6603000000001%2C473.99500368999975%2C633.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C609.6607000000001%2C473.99845371999976%2C620.4017000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C596.6611000000001%2C473.9950036899998%2C607.4021000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C583.6615000000002%2C473.9754535199998%2C594.4025000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C570.6619000000002%2C473.9720034900001%2C581.4029000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C557.6623000000002%2C473.9409532199999%2C568.4033000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C544.6627000000002%2C444.82270001999984%2C555.4037000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22554%22%7D%7D\">against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)", "\u201cFor the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state. In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal \u201crules\u201d on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)", "\u201cCyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)", "\u201cIf a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state \u201cmake full reparation for the injury caused.\u201d120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)", "\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.\u201d (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22537%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.5%2C565.0590000000001%2C473.98107154999974%2C575.8000000000001%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C552.06055%2C473.99832169999996%2C562.80155%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C539.0621%2C473.98682159999976%2C549.8031%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C526.0636499999999%2C473.99487167000007%2C536.8046499999999%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C513.0651999999999%2C473.96037137%2C523.8061999999999%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C500.06674999999984%2C473.98682159999987%2C510.8077499999998%5D%2C%5B137.9999%2C487.05899999999997%2C473.96872309999986%2C497.80929999999984%5D%2C%5B138.00020166000002%2C474.0594%2C473.98712325999986%2C484.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B138.00020166000002%2C461.0598%2C473.960104%2C471.8008%5D%2C%5B138%2C448.05899999999997%2C473.9869215999997%2C458.79999999999995%5D%2C%5B138%2C435.0594%2C473.98692159999996%2C445.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B138%2C422.0598%2C473.9639214%2C432.8008%5D%2C%5B138%2C409.05899999999997%2C473.9770042999999%2C419.8012%5D%2C%5B137.99928278%2C396.0594%2C473.9862043799999%2C406.80039999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22537%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFor the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state.

In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22549%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22553%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B149.49914761999995%2C487.06215000000003%2C473.98596922%2C497.80315%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C474.06255000000004%2C473.95721896999993%2C484.80355000000003%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C461.06295000000006%2C473.96871906999985%2C471.80395000000004%5D%2C%5B137.99904761999994%2C448.05899999999997%2C473.96198699999997%2C458.80435000000006%5D%2C%5B137.99921561000002%2C435.05899999999997%2C473.9777533499999%2C445.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C422.0594%2C473.9858034199999%2C432.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99888182%2C409.05899999999997%2C473.96195499999993%2C419.8008%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C396.0594%2C473.98610520999995%2C406.80039999999997%5D%2C%5B137.99918361%2C383.0598%2C473.9803551599999%2C393.8008%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22553%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FEGZ3TNAS%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22554%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B138%2C661.6591000000001%2C473.9616534%2C672.4001000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C648.6595000000001%2C473.95475333999957%2C659.4005000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C635.6599000000001%2C473.97545351999975%2C646.4009000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C622.6603000000001%2C473.99500368999975%2C633.4013000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C609.6607000000001%2C473.99845371999976%2C620.4017000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C596.6611000000001%2C473.9950036899998%2C607.4021000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C583.6615000000002%2C473.9754535199998%2C594.4025000000001%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C570.6619000000002%2C473.9720034900001%2C581.4029000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C557.6623000000002%2C473.9409532199999%2C568.4033000000002%5D%2C%5B138.00003202000002%2C544.6627000000002%2C444.82270001999984%2C555.4037000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FW63DA6Z6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22554%22%7D%7D\">against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals\u2014even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense.
