The conversation matters a great deal because so much of our international relations are now bound up in the cyber domain, and the existing rules of the road are riddled with gray areas and incomplete understandings.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1513)", "\u201cGiven the architecture of the Internet, the traditional Westphalian stance on sovereignty embedded in customary law and reflected by the IGE in Tallinn 2.0 may frustrate the development of workable norms for controlling below-threshold conflict in cyberspace.157 Consider the simple example of a nonstate, transnational terrorist group spreading malware across several States. Although many States are equipped to disrupt botnets or malware impacts through straightforward, technical cyber operations, the sovereignty rule could stand in the way of State responses to the terrorists that cross national borders. Absent State consent, any cyber operation in response to this kind of intrusion that constitutes a prohibited intervention is unlawful. The barrier applies to responses to States and to nonstate actors.158\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1513)", "\u201cIndeed, the Director and IGE did excellent work in compiling what amounts to a general summary of the rules and principles that apply to cyber operations below the use-of-force threshold.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1495)", "\u201cFrom a policy perspective, the implications of these developments for cyber attribution are coming into sharper focus. A determination of attribution is rarely definitive, and will usually be hedged with some degree of uncertainty. The necessary degree of confidence in an attribution judgment depends on the nature of the malicious activity being attributed and the action that is contemplated in its aftermath. The audience that an attribution judgment seeks to persuade has a significant impact on how subsequent aspects of the attribution process unfold. The Tallinn 2.0 experts recognize these variables and their importance.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1508)", "\u201cIn October 2014, the United States made a public submission101 to the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, a group focused in recent years on identifying legal norms in cyberspace. Among other subjects, the U.S. submission noted the legal limits on exercising countermeasures in cyberspace, including the requirement of the injured State to call on the responsible State to comply with its international obligations before launching cyber countermeasures, except in exigent circumstances.102\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1502)", "\u201cOver time, an international consensus may develop on the minimum level of involvement needed to declare that a State is legally responsible for a cyber operation. But we are not there yet. In working to attribute an intrusion to a human perpetrator or an ultimately responsible State, technical forensics by themselves are generally inconclusive,125 and the information they provide must often be combined with other sources to be genuinely useful.126 The fact that attribution judgments draw on many different sources of information has one major temporal implication-early judgments made with less information are generally less believable than later judgments made with more information. Continuing investigation may reveal additional useful information, which may (or may not) reinforce attributionjudgments made earlier.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1506)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cThe time it takes to produce an attribution judgment with high confidence can significantly impact the lawful responses to cyber intrusions. In some circumstances mistaken attribution can lead to an unlawful response even if the victimized State made a reasonable determination of attribution and implemented countermeasures.139 In national security contexts, the IGE opined that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . .. the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response.140 More robust responses require more evidence, and the more severe the injury to the victim State, the less certain of attribution the State needs to be.141 Similarly, low-level cyber intrusions that are disruptive but not destructive place victimized States \"in a position to accumulate more evidence for attribution,\" suggesting a case-by-case evaluation of required attribution.142\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1509)", "\u201cAs cyber international relations now stand, a few States (the United States and likely Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran) benefit from the absence of express cyber norms on what suffices to attribute State responsibility for cyber exploitation because they have the most offensive cyber capabilities. Russian State involvement in the DNC hacks and the releases through WikiLeaks is a good example. Because it is unclear whether the Russian interference in the U.S. elections amounted to the coercion that is necessary to establish an international law violation, the Putin government could and did act with relative impunity. Establishing attribution of the hacks and dissemination to WikiLeaks to the Russian government was a multifaceted intelligence investigation that could not be completed with confidence in short order. Countermeasures could not be lawfully implemented, and the late-arriving self-help retorsion measures likely did nothing to deter further Russian cyber aggression.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1511)", "\u201cTallinn 2.0 reminds us that the customary international law of State responsibility and attribution is largely drawn from the work of over a half century of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Rules on State Responsibility. While not a treaty, and thus not binding on any nation, the ILC rules were commended to member States by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 and have been cited repeatedly by courts, tribunals, and other bodies.52 The unsurprising threshold point on State responsibility emphasized in Rule 14 of Tallinn 2.0 is that \"[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\"53 States care a great deal about cyber attribution precisely because the absence of attribution precludes State responsibility.54\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1495)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221513%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B77%2C577.9300000000001%2C390.8532%2C587.13%5D%2C%5B54.99961999999999%2C565.23%2C390.483%2C574.63%5D%2C%5B54%2C552.4300000000001%2C390.08850000000024%2C561.83%5D%2C%5B54%2C540.0300000000001%2C390.9532%2C549.4300000000001%5D%2C%5B54%2C527.23%2C335.4634670000003%2C536.6300000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221513%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTallinn 2.0 marks an important but early point in a conversation among States about the most important principles of international law in cyber.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1493</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221508%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90%2C139.513%2C406.0245946660001%2C150.513%5D%2C%5B68.00001671199999%2C126.91300000000001%2C404.8864707540002%2C138.113%5D%2C%5B68%2C114.213%2C404.43928950300017%2C125.313%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221508%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe time it takes to produce an attribution judgment with high confidence can significantly impact the lawful responses to cyber intrusions.

Russian State involvement in the DNC hacks and the releases through WikiLeaks is a good example. Because it is unclear whether the Russian interference in the U.S. elections amounted to the coercion that is necessary to establish an international law violation, the Putin government could and did act with relative impunity. Establishing attribution of the hacks and dissemination to WikiLeaks to the Russian government was a multifaceted intelligence investigation that could not be completed with confidence in short order. Countermeasures could not be lawfully implemented, and the late-arriving self-help retorsion measures likely did nothing to deter further Russian cyber aggression.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221511%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1511</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221495%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C333.413%2C385.80000999999993%2C343.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B49%2C320.913%2C387.03807775%2C331.513%5D%2C%5B49%2C308.413%2C385.8000204115399%2C318.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B49%2C295.713%2C385.70880610999995%2C306.313%5D%2C%5B49%2C283.013%2C385.54898734%2C293.513%5D%2C%5B49%2C270.213%2C386.16199278%2C281.113%5D%2C%5B49%2C257.813%2C384.80598910999987%2C269.3225%5D%2C%5B49%2C245.313%2C385.08843153000026%2C255.613%5D%2C%5B49%2C232.613%2C386.749957571435%2C243.113%5D%2C%5B49%2C220.113%2C386.3892940030001%2C231.9225%5D%2C%5B49%2C207.413%2C386.00359166599986%2C217.713%5D%2C%5B49.000454074000004%2C194.613%2C189.75%2C207.6225%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221495%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTallinn 2.0 reminds us that the customary international law of State responsibility and attribution is largely drawn from the work of over a half century of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Rules on State Responsibility. While not a treaty, and thus not binding on any nation, the ILC rules were commended to member States by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 and have been cited repeatedly by courts, tribunals, and other bodies.52 The unsurprising threshold point on State responsibility emphasized in Rule 14 of Tallinn 2.0 is that \"[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\"53 States care a great deal about cyber attribution precisely because the absence of attribution precludes State responsibility.54\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

Damaging the hackers' hardware would in all likelihood, however, be characterized as a forbidden use of force at international law.77 Admiral Stavridis wisely recognized that any response to a responsible State requires attribution to that State. Yet Admiral Stavridis overstated international law attribution requirements. Applying the Rules on State responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists \"definitive information\" on attribution. Although wise as a matter of policy, the failure to offer persuasive evidence of State attribution is not wrongful legally.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1499)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221504%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B94%2C235.713%2C409.5868874990002%2C245.613%5D%2C%5B72%2C223.013%2C410.66320416499997%2C233.113%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221504%22%7D%7D\">\u201cNor is the failure of a State to provide persuasive proof of attribution itself an internationally wrongful act.

[T]here is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action.\"l2</span>0 <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221505%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1505</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221499%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C538.113%2C387.013403112%2C548.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C525.113%2C387.19999699999994%2C536.2130000000001%5D%2C%5B50%2C512.613%2C386.90880860999994%2C523.7130000000001%5D%2C%5B50%2C499.913%2C386.66979727800003%2C511.5225%5D%2C%5B51%2C487.313%2C386.665602112%2C498.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B51%2C474.713%2C385.99038722399985%2C485.613%5D%2C%5B51%2C462.013%2C386.36349008500014%2C473.013%5D%2C%5B51.00029320300001%2C449.513%2C386.99999499999996%2C460.513%5D%2C%5B50%2C436.613%2C387.1963903339999%2C447.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B51%2C424.113%2C386.26598556000005%2C435.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50.99967571199994%2C411.613%2C386.70880610999995%2C423.5225%5D%2C%5B51%2C398.913%2C386.08848483500026%2C409.813%5D%2C%5B51%2C386.213%2C385.60379029800015%2C397.313%5D%2C%5B51%2C373.213%2C386.5150889210001%2C383.313%5D%2C%5B51.00014662699999%2C361.01300000000003%2C386.66309000100006%2C372.113%5D%2C%5B51.00029320300001%2C348.51300000000003%2C387.142587116%2C359.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C335.813%2C388.01760721999995%2C347.013%5D%2C%5B51%2C323.013%2C387.45079566800007%2C334.313%5D%2C%5B51.00009%2C310.313%2C386.7023855040002%2C321.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.813%2C388.3955969%2C308.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B51%2C285.413%2C387.5868874990002%2C296.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C272.413%2C153.50318811199998%2C282.613%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221499%22%7D%7D\">\u201cRetired Admiral James Stavridis, former head of NATO forces in Europe, offered a series of potential responses to the Russian DNC hack that he maintained would underscore U.S. determination to \"respond with a firm hand.\"74 Among other things, Admiral Stavridis argued that \"the United States could use its own offensive cyber-tools to punish Russian hackers by knocking them off-line or even damaging their hardware.\"75 Acknowledging that some would object that such a response may escalate the conflict, Admiral Stavridis admitted that \"[t]he burden of proof for attribution would be higher\" if we responded as above and \"would be viable only if Washington had definitive information on the command and control centers that launched the hacking activity.\"76 Admiral Stavridis's proposal to disconnect the hackers from Internet connectivity is likely not prohibited by international law unless doing so would require some kind of entry into the hackers' systems. Damaging the hackers' hardware would in all likelihood, however, be characterized as a forbidden use of force at international law.77 Admiral Stavridis wisely recognized that any response to a responsible State requires attribution to that State. Yet Admiral Stavridis overstated international law attribution requirements. Applying the Rules on State responsibility and attribution compiled in Tallinn 2.0, there is no burden of proof or requirement that there exists \"definitive information\" on attribution. Although wise as a matter of policy, the failure to offer persuasive evidence of State attribution is not wrongful legally.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221499%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1499</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "William Banks", "date": "2016", "journal": "Texas Law Review", "title": "State responsibility and attribution of cyber intrusions after tallinn 2.0 symposium: tallinn manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations", "abstract": "", "doi": "", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/tlr95&i=1553", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "1487-1514", "short_title": "State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0 Symposium", "item_id": "G7KN4SYC", "citation_key": "banksStateResponsibilityAttribution2016", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/S8YZLRXI", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1711072}}, {"authors": "William Banks", "date": "2016", "journal": "Texas Law Review", "title": "State responsibility and attribution of cyber intrusions after tallinn 2.0 symposium: tallinn manual 2.0 on the international law applicable to cyber operations", "abstract": "", "doi": "", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/tlr95&i=1553", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "1487-1514", "short_title": "State Responsibility and Attribution of Cyber Intrusions after Tallinn 2.0 Symposium", "item_id": "G7KN4SYC", "citation_key": "banksStateResponsibilityAttribution2016", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/S8YZLRXI", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 1711072}}], "keywords": ["#proof_of_attribution #internationally_wrongful_act #cyber_operation #United_Nations_Group_of_Governmental_Experts #Brian_Egan", "#responses_Russian_hacking #international_law_attribution #cyber-tools_punishment #Admiral_James_Stavridis #NATO #Russian_DNC #Tallinn_20 #Rules_on_State_responsibility"], "score": [0.33, 0.33], "paragraph_id": [35623713, 57426236]}, "evidence OR cyber OR attribution ": {"section_title": ["V.

In some circumstances mistaken attribution can lead to an unlawful response even if the victimized State made a reasonable determination of attribution and implemented countermeasures.139 In national security contexts, the IGE opined that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . .. the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response.140 More robust responses require more evidence, and the more severe the injury to the victim State, the less certain of attribution the State needs to be.141 Similarly, low-level cyber intrusions that are disruptive but not destructive place victimized States \"in a position to accumulate more evidence for attribution,\" suggesting a case-by-case evaluation of required attribution.142\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1509)", "\u201cStates are likewise not obligated to publicly provide evidence of attribution when responding to another State's cyber intrusions.121 While the IGE acknowledged the value in such a disclosure requirement, they found insufficient State practice and opiniojuristo recognize \"an established basis under international law for such an obligation.122 The IGE noted that the highly classified nature of such attribution assessments is the primary reason for the absence of customary international law on this important point.123 The October 2014 U.S. submission to the GGE is consistent with the IGE on all of these points.124\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1505)", "\u201cFor example, in February 2013 Mandiant issued an extensive report on Chinese cyber espionage that relied on detailed evidence of Chinese government attribution.128 Mandiant found with a high degree of confidence that a specific unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) perpetrated hacks on many of the targeted industries in the United States, after first identifying the particular machines and operators involved in the espionage.129 The Mandiant work helped pave the way for the May 2014 indictments by the Justice Department of five PLA members on economic espionage charges.130 In another example, after senior DNC executives learned from FBI officials that they had been hacked, the DNC hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, to rebuild its computer security.131 Within a day, CrowdStrike advised its client that the hacks originated in Russia.132 Several other prominent examples of private security firms' involvement in attribution of cyber intrusions by States are noted below.133\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1507)", "\u201cReasonableness may also take into account \"the severity of the cyber operations being directed against the State and the robustness of any possible response.\"'114 The IGE suggested that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . . ., the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response\"115 . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses ... grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.\"\"116 At the same time, \"the severity of the cyber operations directed at the injured State\"117 matters. A State confronted with \"low-level cyber operations that are merely disruptive\" may be expected to amass more evidence for attribution than a State victimized by \"devastating cyber operations and needing to respond immediately to terminate them.\"118 To put it slightly differently, the IGE acknowledged that all attribution judgments that determine State responsibility are necessarily accompanied by some measure of uncertainty. Because there is no accepted State practice, nor international agreement or domestic law on how much evidence suffices for attribution of State responsibility, the attribution bar is at present set very low by international law.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1504)", "\u201cNor is the failure of a State to provide persuasive proof of attribution itself an internationally wrongful act.

Customary international law, after all, develops from a consistent practice of States followed out of a sense of legal obligation.143 When States articulate their views on how international law applies to cyber operations, such public statements increase expectations of State behavior and thus contribute to greater predictability and stability in cyber operations.144 Instances such as the Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 election provide an opportunity for the United States to clearly and unequivocally delineate red lines, reinforced by a set of lawful responses that would follow their breach. That the Obama administration equivocated, delayed attribution, and then delayed ineffectual sanctions did not serve those important international law objectives.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1509)", "\u201cTallinn 2.0 reminds us that the customary international law of State responsibility and attribution is largely drawn from the work of over a half century of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Rules on State Responsibility. While not a treaty, and thus not binding on any nation, the ILC rules were commended to member States by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 and have been cited repeatedly by courts, tribunals, and other bodies.52 The unsurprising threshold point on State responsibility emphasized in Rule 14 of Tallinn 2.0 is that \"[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\"53 States care a great deal about cyber attribution precisely because the absence of attribution precludes State responsibility.54\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1495)", "\u201cRules 15-18 of Tallinn 2.0 summarize the customary international law of attribution of cyber operations in nuanced terms. Rule 15 states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.\"55 Rule 15 may be reduced to an admonition that States are responsible for cyber-related acts of their own officials, agents, contractors, non-State actors, and other States to the extent they actually control the operations. Some explanation helps place application of the Rule in a few less obviously State-controlled settings.56 One useful example from the IGE narrative concerns \"spoofing,\" the practice of a representative of a State impersonating another State or its IP addresses and thereby feigning identity and sometimes its location.57 Particularly when a cyber intrusion demands an immediate response from the victimized State, spoofing can completely flummox existing international law on attribution.

Customary international law, after all, develops from a consistent practice of States followed out of a sense of legal obligation.143 When States articulate their views on how international law applies to cyber operations, such public statements increase expectations of State behavior and thus contribute to greater predictability and stability in cyber operations.144 Instances such as the Russian attempts to interfere with the 2016 election provide an opportunity for the United States to clearly and unequivocally delineate red lines, reinforced by a set of lawful responses that would follow their breach.

Rule 15 states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by organs of a State, or by persons or entities empowered by domestic law to exercise elements of governmental authority, are attributable to the State.\"55 Rule 15 may be reduced to an admonition that States are responsible for cyber-related acts of their own officials, agents, contractors, non-State actors, and other States to the extent they actually control the operations. Some explanation helps place application of the Rule in a few less obviously State-controlled settings.56 One useful example from the IGE narrative concerns \"spoofing,\" the practice of a representative of a State impersonating another State or its IP addresses and thereby feigning identity and sometimes its location.57 Particularly when a cyber intrusion demands an immediate response from the victimized State, spoofing can completely flummox existing international law on attribution.

Indeed, the evidence of attribution may never be made public because of the sensitivity of the intelligence sources and methods utilized in the investigation.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1510)", "\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party. This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cIn October 2014, the United States made a public submission101 to the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, a group focused in recent years on identifying legal norms in cyberspace. Among other subjects, the U.S. submission noted the legal limits on exercising countermeasures in cyberspace, including the requirement of the injured State to call on the responsible State to comply with its international obligations before launching cyber countermeasures, except in exigent circumstances.102\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1502)", "\u201cTallinn 2.0 reminds us that the customary international law of State responsibility and attribution is largely drawn from the work of over a half century of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Rules on State Responsibility. While not a treaty, and thus not binding on any nation, the ILC rules were commended to member States by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012 and have been cited repeatedly by courts, tribunals, and other bodies.52 The unsurprising threshold point on State responsibility emphasized in Rule 14 of Tallinn 2.0 is that \"[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\"53 States care a great deal about cyber attribution precisely because the absence of attribution precludes State responsibility.54\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1495)", "\u201cFor the sake of argument, assume that the Russian DNC hack was an unlawful intervention. What could the United States have done in response? Admiral Stavridis appeared to propose what international law refers to as countermeasures. Countermeasures are responses, whether cyber in nature or not, below the use-of-force threshold designed to prevent or mitigate a perpetrator State from continuing its unlawful cyber intervention.94 Though short of a use of force, countermeasures would be unlawful themselves but for the purpose of stopping the intrusion.95 Because they respond to an internationally wrongful act, countermeasures require prior attribution and notice to the offending State that the victim State knows the source of the cyber intrusion.96 International law also requires giving the aggressor State a chance to forbear.97 In addition, the countermeasures must be proportional to the original intrusion98 and they must have as their purpose \"induc[ing] compliance with international law.\"99 Punitive countermeasures are forbidden.100\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1502)", "\u201cThe core requirement of a prohibited intervention is coercion.90 As confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the Nicaraguajudgment, \"the element of coercion . . . forms the very essence of [] prohibited intervention.\"91 As understood in Tallinn 2.0, coercion \"is not limited to physical force, but rather refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice . . . to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\"92 A January 2017 memorandum from the General Counsel of the Department of Defense to the Combatant Commands and other senior military and civilian lawyers in the Pentagon affirmed coercion as a prerequisite means for unlawful intervention, and concluded that military cyber activities that fall below the use of force threshold and do not violate the nonintervention principle are \"largely unregulated by international law at this time.\"93\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1501)", "\u201cRule 16 states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by an organ of a State that has been placed at the disposal of another State are attributable to the latter when the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of governmental authority of the State at the disposal of which it is placed.\"59 The same practical application of State responsibility provides the basis for Rule 17, which states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.\"60 In other words, States do not escape legal responsibility for internationally wrongful acts by perpetrating them through proxies. The extension of State responsibility to private actors that are acting under the direction and control of the State drives this Rule, which embraces the \"effective control\" formulation from the International Court of Justice in its Nicaragua and Genocide judgments.61 One wrinkle that distinguishes attribution of non-State actors to States is that the ultravires acts of non-State actors are generally not attributable to the State.62 An example illustrates the limits of the principle of direction and control: a State instructs a non-State actor to introduce malware into another State's government networks and the non-State actor misappropriates the malware to target a third state. There is no attribution to the State because the non-State actor implemented the instruction in a way that was ultra vires.63\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1497)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221510%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B94%2C460.813%2C409.69231335999996%2C470.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B71%2C448.113%2C408.665978820376%2C458.013%5D%2C%5B71%2C435.413%2C408.930198722%2C445.313%5D%2C%5B71%2C422.613%2C408.1987897779998%2C432.513%5D%2C%5B71%2C410.213%2C408.40719076162765%2C420.113%5D%2C%5B72%2C397.413%2C407.672385784%2C407.313%5D%2C%5B71%2C384.713%2C407.953195112%2C394.613%5D%2C%5B71%2C372.013%2C341.96188374900026%2C381.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221510%22%7D%7D\">\u201cInternational law as summarized in Tallinn 2.0 requires much less proof of attribution than lawyers traditionally expect.148 Of course lawyers expect rigorous standards for proof in civil trials or criminal prosecution, not necessarily in national security investigations, depending on the investigative method.

Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.

16 states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by an organ of a State that has been placed at the disposal of another State are attributable to the latter when the organ is acting in the exercise of elements of governmental authority of the State at the disposal of which it is placed.\"59 The same practical application of State responsibility provides the basis for Rule 17, which states that \"[c]yber operations conducted by a non-State actor are attributable to a State when: (a) engaged in pursuant to its instructions or under its direction or control; or (b) the State acknowledges and adopts the operations as its own.\"60 In other words, States do not escape legal responsibility for internationally wrongful acts by perpetrating them through proxies. The extension of State responsibility to private actors that are acting under the direction and control of the State drives this Rule, which embraces the \"effective control\" formulation from the International Court of Justice in its Nicaragua and Genocide judgments.61 One wrinkle that distinguishes attribution of non-State actors to States is that the ultravires acts of non-State actors are generally not attributable to the State.62 An example illustrates the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221497%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B48.000186592999995%2C603.613%2C383.01308850100014%2C613.913%5D%2C%5B48.00007333899998%2C590.913%2C383.7088123638449%2C601.2130000000001%5D%2C%5B48%2C578.2130000000001%2C384.403197999%2C588.813%5D%2C%5B48%2C565.413%2C383.953195112%2C575.913%5D%2C%5B48%2C552.7130000000001%2C232.000002%2C563.8979999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221497%22%7D%7D\">limits of the principle of direction and control: a State instructs a non-State actor to introduce malware into another State's government networks and the non-State actor misappropriates the malware to target a third state.

Attribution of malicious cyber activity can trace to a machine, to one or more persons operating the machine that initiates the cyber intrusion, and to a person or entity that is found to be ultimately responsible for that activity.106 Attribution is determined by a wide range of facts, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and diplomatic relations, among others.107 The declassified Background to \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\" reminds us that intelligence analysis of cyber intrusions seeks \"to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders' intentions. This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities.\"108 The Intelligence Community assessment reflects \"a series of judgments that describe whether [the intrusion] was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, the perpetrator's possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation.\"109\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1503)", "\u201cHow much evidence of attribution is enough? As reflected in the commentary in Tallinn 2.0, international law requires a granular analysis, taking into account \"the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.\"137 A State merely encouraging a non-State actor to undertake a malicious cyber intrusion is not sufficient for State responsibility.138 In this respect, the nuance and detail offered in Tallinn 2.0 is extremely valuable, showing how judicial decisions and analysis from customary international law sources can help in determining attribution.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1508)", "\u201cNor is the failure of a State to provide persuasive proof of attribution itself an internationally wrongful act. There are no burdens of proof or additional legal criteria for establishing attribution. The 2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report noted that accusations of wrongful acts by States \"should be substantiated,\"119 but the GGE gave no indication of which or how much evidence would suffice or even count. The United States' view, articulated by State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan in November 2016, is that \"a State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State.... [T]here is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action.\"l20 (Banks, 2016, p. 1505)", "\u201cThe time it takes to produce an attribution judgment with high confidence can significantly impact the lawful responses to cyber intrusions. In some circumstances mistaken attribution can lead to an unlawful response even if the victimized State made a reasonable determination of attribution and implemented countermeasures.139 In national security contexts, the IGE opined that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . .. the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response.140 More robust responses require more evidence, and the more severe the injury to the victim State, the less certain of attribution the State needs to be.141 Similarly, low-level cyber intrusions that are disruptive but not destructive place victimized States \"in a position to accumulate more evidence for attribution,\" suggesting a case-by-case evaluation of required attribution.142\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1509)", "\u201cInternational law as summarized in Tallinn 2.0 requires much less proof of attribution than lawyers traditionally expect.148 Of course lawyers expect rigorous standards for proof in civil trials or criminal prosecution, not necessarily in national security investigations, depending on the investigative method. The proof necessary for attribution in cyber exploitation involving State responsibility certainly need not stand up in court. Indeed, the evidence of attribution may never be made public because of the sensitivity of the intelligence sources and methods utilized in the investigation.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1510)", "\u201cReasonableness may also take into account \"the severity of the cyber operations being directed against the State and the robustness of any possible response.\"'114 The IGE suggested that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . . ., the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response\"115 . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses ... grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.\"\"116 At the same time, \"the severity of the cyber operations directed at the injured State\"117 matters. A State confronted with \"low-level cyber operations that are merely disruptive\" may be expected to amass more evidence for attribution than a State victimized by \"devastating cyber operations and needing to respond immediately to terminate them.\"118 To put it slightly differently, the IGE acknowledged that all attribution judgments that determine State responsibility are necessarily accompanied by some measure of uncertainty. Because there is no accepted State practice, nor international agreement or domestic law on how much evidence suffices for attribution of State responsibility, the attribution bar is at present set very low by international law.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1504)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221508%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A22%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B91%2C356.713%2C406.47539033400017%2C367.513%5D%2C%5B69%2C344.013%2C406.5876936670001%2C355.313%5D%2C%5B69%2C331.313%2C406.01760721999995%2C342.813%5D%2C%5B69%2C318.813%2C405.96309300100006%2C330.4225%5D%2C%5B69%2C305.913%2C405.834490555%2C317.313%5D%2C%5B69%2C293.413%2C405.47539033400017%2C304.613%5D%2C%5B69%2C282.213%2C123.37419008200001%2C292.113%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221508%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe sources and methods pursued to determine attribution in national security cyber cases are in some ways different and in some ways like those used in law enforcement.

As reflected in the commentary in Tallinn 2.0, international law requires a granular analysis, taking into account \"the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.\"137 A State merely encouraging a non-State actor to undertake a malicious cyber intrusion is not sufficient for State responsibility.138 In this respect, the nuance and detail offered in Tallinn 2.0 is extremely valuable, showing how judicial decisions and analysis from customary international law sources can help in determining attribution.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1508)", "\u201cFor example, in February 2013 Mandiant issued an extensive report on Chinese cyber espionage that relied on detailed evidence of Chinese government attribution.128 Mandiant found with a high degree of confidence that a specific unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) perpetrated hacks on many of the targeted industries in the United States, after first identifying the particular machines and operators involved in the espionage.129 The Mandiant work helped pave the way for the May 2014 indictments by the Justice Department of five PLA members on economic espionage charges.130 In another example, after senior DNC executives learned from FBI officials that they had been hacked, the DNC hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, to rebuild its computer security.131 Within a day, CrowdStrike advised its client that the hacks originated in Russia.132 Several other prominent examples of private security firms' involvement in attribution of cyber intrusions by States are noted below.133\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1507)", "\u201cReasonableness may also take into account \"the severity of the cyber operations being directed against the State and the robustness of any possible response.\"'114 The IGE suggested that \"as a general matter the graver the underlying breach . . ., the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response\"115 . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses ... grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.\"\"116 At the same time, \"the severity of the cyber operations directed at the injured State\"117 matters.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1490)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221494%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B75%2C604.613%2C412.0499955000001%2C614.913%5D%2C%5B75.00009%2C592.113%2C412.320488895%2C602.2130000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C579.113%2C320.047489025%2C589.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221494%22%7D%7D\">cyber intrusions in the future.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1493</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221490%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96%2C385.013%2C409.7939918899999%2C395.313%5D%2C%5B72.99998153200005%2C372.51300000000003%2C410.7915924459999%2C382.813%5D%2C%5B73%2C359.813%2C410.696605499%2C370.113%5D%2C%5B73%2C347.013%2C412.73735834999997%2C357.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B72%2C334.313%2C413.15000000000003%2C344.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B74%2C321.813%2C410.953195112%2C333.5225%5D%2C%5B73%2C309.113%2C411.45079566800007%2C319.513%5D%2C%5B73%2C296.413%2C410.9987772446679%2C306.71299999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution.

how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221494%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1494</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221506%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A20%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B93%2C359.813%2C407.73598583999996%2C370.113%5D%2C%5B71%2C347.113%2C408.0023885040002%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B71%2C334.413%2C407.996483335%2C344.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B71%2C321.913%2C408.6384895966803%2C332.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B71%2C309.113%2C408.45079566800007%2C319.513%5D%2C%5B71%2C296.513%2C408.029788668%2C307.013%5D%2C%5B71%2C283.713%2C408.013403112%2C294.313%5D%2C%5B71%2C271.313%2C407.13838334400003%2C281.613%5D%2C%5B71%2C258.513%2C407.40317067710015%2C268.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B71.00012863209997%2C246.21299999999997%2C210.7500025%2C258.53475000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221506%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments.

In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1490)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy notes that security firms reporting on attribution \"can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place\" and states that \"[tihe Defense Department will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution. This work will be especially important for deterrence as activist groups, criminal organizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.\"127\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1506)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221493%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C347.813%2C386.08848483500026%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C335.313%2C386.66898734808996%2C345.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C322.613%2C387.69999700000005%2C332.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C309.813%2C386.953195112%2C321.3225%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.413%2C387.66199778%2C307.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C284.613%2C386.60478988799986%2C294.513%5D%2C%5B50.00027040400005%2C272.213%2C386.54259111600004%2C282.113%5D%2C%5B50.000427204000005%2C259.413%2C386.376591556%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C247.013%2C386.7392925030001%2C256.913%5D%2C%5B51%2C234.213%2C386.953195112%2C244.413%5D%2C%5B50.00052226399998%2C221.513%2C386.959591336%2C231.413%5D%2C%5B51%2C209.013%2C386.730196722%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C196.313%2C386.1855903359999%2C206.213%5D%2C%5B50.00030713799998%2C183.813%2C386.8761905020001%2C193.713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1493</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221490%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96%2C474.713%2C411.8268777999999%2C484.813%5D%2C%5B74%2C462.013%2C410.79039522399995%2C473.11025%5D%2C%5B72.99983959600002%2C449.51300000000003%2C409.660002166%2C459.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B73%2C436.613%2C410.87680422399995%2C446.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B73%2C424.113%2C410.6237944980001%2C436.0225%5D%2C%5B73%2C411.413%2C410.99521649919996%2C421.913%5D%2C%5B73.00044272719998%2C398.61300000000006%2C110.48723578519999%2C408.51300000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1490</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221494%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.0000276936%2C537.813%2C414.95843112%2C548.313%5D%2C%5B76%2C525.113%2C412.49359377599995%2C535.513%5D%2C%5B75%2C512.413%2C411.74999975%2C524.4224999999999%5D%2C%5B75%2C499.713%2C413.0499955000001%2C510.313%5D%2C%5B75%2C487.013%2C412.24299417000003%2C497.613%5D%2C%5B75%2C474.213%2C412.48299378%2C486.3225%5D%2C%5B76%2C461.513%2C413.78999999999996%2C472.113%5D%2C%5B75%2C448.813%2C412.40000499999996%2C459.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B75%2C436.313%2C411.71389166900013%2C446.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B75%2C423.413%2C412.659593336%2C433.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B75%2C410.913%2C411.57748972499996%2C422.6225%5D%2C%5B75%2C398.213%2C412.464403666%2C408.813%5D%2C%5B75%2C385.413%2C412.0499955000001%2C396.013%5D%2C%5B75%2C373.013%2C239.74999975%2C384.5225%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221494%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1490)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy notes that security firms reporting on attribution \"can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place\" and states that \"[tihe Defense Department will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution. This work will be especially important for deterrence as activist groups, criminal organizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.\"127\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1506)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221493%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C347.813%2C386.08848483500026%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C335.313%2C386.66898734808996%2C345.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C322.613%2C387.69999700000005%2C332.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C309.813%2C386.953195112%2C321.3225%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.413%2C387.66199778%2C307.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C284.613%2C386.60478988799986%2C294.513%5D%2C%5B50.00027040400005%2C272.213%2C386.54259111600004%2C282.113%5D%2C%5B50.000427204000005%2C259.413%2C386.376591556%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C247.013%2C386.7392925030001%2C256.913%5D%2C%5B51%2C234.213%2C386.953195112%2C244.413%5D%2C%5B50.00052226399998%2C221.513%2C386.959591336%2C231.413%5D%2C%5B51%2C209.013%2C386.730196722%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C196.313%2C386.1855903359999%2C206.213%5D%2C%5B50.00030713799998%2C183.813%2C386.8761905020001%2C193.713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party.

of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221494%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1494</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221506%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A20%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B93%2C359.813%2C407.73598583999996%2C370.113%5D%2C%5B71%2C347.113%2C408.0023885040002%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B71%2C334.413%2C407.996483335%2C344.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B71%2C321.913%2C408.6384895966803%2C332.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B71%2C309.113%2C408.45079566800007%2C319.513%5D%2C%5B71%2C296.513%2C408.029788668%2C307.013%5D%2C%5B71%2C283.713%2C408.013403112%2C294.313%5D%2C%5B71%2C271.313%2C407.13838334400003%2C281.613%5D%2C%5B71%2C258.513%2C407.40317067710015%2C268.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B71.00012863209997%2C246.21299999999997%2C210.7500025%2C258.53475000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221506%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments.

In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace. Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious and arguably more important-examination of the international legal framework that applies to malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the use-of-force level.49\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy notes that security firms reporting on attribution \"can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place\" and states that \"[tihe Defense Department will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution. This work will be especially important for deterrence as activist groups, criminal organizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.\"127\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1506)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221490%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96%2C474.713%2C411.8268777999999%2C484.813%5D%2C%5B74%2C462.013%2C410.79039522399995%2C473.11025%5D%2C%5B72.99983959600002%2C449.51300000000003%2C409.660002166%2C459.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B73%2C436.613%2C410.87680422399995%2C446.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B73%2C424.113%2C410.6237944980001%2C436.0225%5D%2C%5B73%2C411.413%2C410.99521649919996%2C421.913%5D%2C%5B73.00044272719998%2C398.61300000000006%2C110.48723578519999%2C408.51300000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1490</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221493%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C347.813%2C386.08848483500026%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C335.313%2C386.66898734808996%2C345.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C322.613%2C387.69999700000005%2C332.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C309.813%2C386.953195112%2C321.3225%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.413%2C387.66199778%2C307.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C284.613%2C386.60478988799986%2C294.513%5D%2C%5B50.00027040400005%2C272.213%2C386.54259111600004%2C282.113%5D%2C%5B50.000427204000005%2C259.413%2C386.376591556%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C247.013%2C386.7392925030001%2C256.913%5D%2C%5B51%2C234.213%2C386.953195112%2C244.413%5D%2C%5B50.00052226399998%2C221.513%2C386.959591336%2C231.413%5D%2C%5B51%2C209.013%2C386.730196722%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C196.313%2C386.1855903359999%2C206.213%5D%2C%5B50.00030713799998%2C183.813%2C386.8761905020001%2C193.713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution.

In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1493</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221490%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96%2C385.013%2C409.7939918899999%2C395.313%5D%2C%5B72.99998153200005%2C372.51300000000003%2C410.7915924459999%2C382.813%5D%2C%5B73%2C359.813%2C410.696605499%2C370.113%5D%2C%5B73%2C347.013%2C412.73735834999997%2C357.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B72%2C334.313%2C413.15000000000003%2C344.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B74%2C321.813%2C410.953195112%2C333.5225%5D%2C%5B73%2C309.113%2C411.45079566800007%2C319.513%5D%2C%5B73%2C296.413%2C410.9987772446679%2C306.71299999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)", "\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party. This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cAs was the case with the release of the Tallinn Manual on the Law of Cyber Warfare in 2013, expectations are high that the second project will coalesce disparate understandings of the international law of cyberspace.46 Indeed, the Tallinn Manual provided much-needed confidence for States that international law applies in the cyber domain and supplied a framework for applying to cyberspace widely understood norms from kinetic conflict.47 The Tallinn Manual also consisted in the main of what is at the core of Tallinn 2.0: the opinions of a distinguished International Group of Experts (IGE) on how international law norms apply to cyberspace.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1493</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221493%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C347.813%2C386.08848483500026%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C335.313%2C386.66898734808996%2C345.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C322.613%2C387.69999700000005%2C332.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C309.813%2C386.953195112%2C321.3225%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.413%2C387.66199778%2C307.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C284.613%2C386.60478988799986%2C294.513%5D%2C%5B50.00027040400005%2C272.213%2C386.54259111600004%2C282.113%5D%2C%5B50.000427204000005%2C259.413%2C386.376591556%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C247.013%2C386.7392925030001%2C256.913%5D%2C%5B51%2C234.213%2C386.953195112%2C244.413%5D%2C%5B50.00052226399998%2C221.513%2C386.959591336%2C231.413%5D%2C%5B51%2C209.013%2C386.730196722%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C196.313%2C386.1855903359999%2C206.213%5D%2C%5B50.00030713799998%2C183.813%2C386.8761905020001%2C193.713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party.

In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence.

In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence.

Where the first project applied the jus ad bellum and jus in bello to cyber incidents that cross a use-of-force threshold,48 the objective of the second project was in some ways much more ambitious

Among other subjects, the U.S. submission noted the legal limits on exercising countermeasures in cyberspace, including the requirement of the injured State to call on the responsible State to comply with its international obligations before launching cyber countermeasures, except in exigent circumstances.102\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1502)", "\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party. This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)", "\u201cOne positive development in the attribution landscape in the past several years is the increasing involvement of private-sector firms in rendering attribution judgments. The 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy notes that security firms reporting on attribution \"can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from conducting attacks in the first place\" and states that \"[tihe Defense Department will continue to collaborate closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen attribution. This work will be especially important for deterrence as activist groups, criminal organizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.\"127\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1506)", "\u201cOn December 29, the FBI and DHS released Joint Analysis Report: GRIZZLY STEPPE-Russian Malicious Cyber Activity.23 The report reinforced the agencies' earlier conclusions that Russia was behind the DNC hack, and it provided new technical details about the methods used by Russian assets, including malware samples.24 Still, the report offered little forensic evidence to confirm the government's attribution statement from October.25\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1490)", "\u201cCyber attribution is more art than science and presents a multifaceted set of problems.42 Law is only a part of the attribution calculus, and understanding the components of attribution is essential for shaping a legal and policy strategy to deter harmful cyber intrusions in the future.43 As stated by former Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division John Carlin, [A]ttributing activity on the Internet is challenging. Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1493)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221502%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B95%2C491.513%2C409.70880610999995%2C502.313%5D%2C%5B72%2C479.013%2C410.246796888%2C489.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B72%2C466.313%2C411.66284165%2C476.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B72%2C453.613%2C409.41199028%2C464.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B72%2C440.913%2C409.70880610999995%2C451.513%5D%2C%5B73%2C428.213%2C409.70880610999995%2C439.013%5D%2C%5B72%2C415.713%2C409.79998800000004%2C426.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B72%2C402.213%2C408.57897909000025%2C412.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B73%2C390.213%2C227.000002%2C401.69800000000004%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221502%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn October 2014, the United States made a public submission101 to the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, a group focused in recent years on identifying legal norms in cyberspace.

This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level.

Hackers often route their malicious traffic through third-party proxies they either rent or compromise. An attacker in Eastern Europe that uses a botnet of compromised computers in the Middle East to conduct a DDoS attack against a U.S. target creates a false narrative that actors located in the Middle East were responsible for that act. Even attributing an attack to the actual originating computer may be insufficient; we may know the machine used to execute a hack, but not the person or group that controlled it. Thus, technical investigation must often be supplemented by credible human intelligence. And all of this must be done quickly and consistently; attribution is of little use if it takes years and only identifies a small fraction of attackers.44\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

Attribution is in any case an all-source enterprise. States that are forced by international law to publicly express the proof of attribution to explain countermeasures or some other response run the risk of overstating their case, or not supporting it thoroughly, and thereby engage in an internationally wrongful act.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1511)", "\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party. This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful cyber intrusions in the future. The United States should also make clear that it will employ a range of lawful responses to State-sponsored cyber intrusions, including commercial and trade-based tools.\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1494)", "\u201cAttribution can mean different things depending on a State's objectives. Attribution of malicious cyber activity can trace to a machine, to one or more persons operating the machine that initiates the cyber intrusion, and to a person or entity that is found to be ultimately responsible for that activity.106 Attribution is determined by a wide range of facts, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and diplomatic relations, among others.107 The declassified Background to \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\" reminds us that intelligence analysis of cyber intrusions seeks \"to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders' intentions. This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities.\"108 The Intelligence Community assessment reflects \"a series of judgments that describe whether [the intrusion] was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, the perpetrator's possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation.\"109\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1503)", "\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution. The public report concluded that Russia had conducted a large-scale cyber operation on the orders of President Vladimir Putin with the intention of \"undermin[ing] public faith in the US democratic process.\"27 Their objective was to \"denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency\" while helping Donald Trump win the election.28 The report concluded \"with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release U.S. victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks.\"29 In addition to hacking and releasing the e-mails and attachments, the Russian campaign included extensive use of social media and Internet trolls, along with propaganda on Russian-controlled media, including Russian TV channel RT America.30\u201d (Banks, 2016, p. 1491)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221510%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B93%2C228.513%2C408.3956%2C238.413%5D%2C%5B71%2C215.813%2C407.61699222%2C225.713%5D%2C%5B71%2C203.013%2C408.0023944439999%2C212.913%5D%2C%5B71.00023866999999%2C190.313%2C407.1646873370002%2C200.21300000000002%5D%2C%5B71%2C177.613%2C407.1753873340001%2C187.513%5D%2C%5B70%2C164.913%2C407.0795907259999%2C175.013%5D%2C%5B70%2C152.213%2C407.665602112%2C162.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B71%2C139.713%2C407.20638594098006%2C149.613%5D%2C%5B71%2C125.413%2C407.30130788400004%2C136.913%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221510%22%7D%7D\">\u201cStates are better able to attribute cyber intrusions than they were a decade ago, but the technical environment is so dynamic that new tools constantly both improve and occlude attribution capabilities.

States that are forced by international law to publicly express the proof of attribution to explain countermeasures or some other response run the risk of overstating their case,</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221511%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53%2C600.513%2C388.4130825010003%2C610.513%5D%2C%5B53%2C587.8130000000001%2C111.00959433599999%2C597.7130000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221511%22%7D%7D\">or not supporting it thoroughly, and thereby engage in an internationally wrongful act.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221511%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1511</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221493%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C347.813%2C386.08848483500026%2C357.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C335.313%2C386.66898734808996%2C345.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B50%2C322.613%2C387.69999700000005%2C332.513%5D%2C%5B51%2C309.813%2C386.953195112%2C321.3225%5D%2C%5B51%2C297.413%2C387.66199778%2C307.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C284.613%2C386.60478988799986%2C294.513%5D%2C%5B50.00027040400005%2C272.213%2C386.54259111600004%2C282.113%5D%2C%5B50.000427204000005%2C259.413%2C386.376591556%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B50%2C247.013%2C386.7392925030001%2C256.913%5D%2C%5B51%2C234.213%2C386.953195112%2C244.413%5D%2C%5B50.00052226399998%2C221.513%2C386.959591336%2C231.413%5D%2C%5B51%2C209.013%2C386.730196722%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B50%2C196.313%2C386.1855903359999%2C206.213%5D%2C%5B50.00030713799998%2C183.813%2C386.8761905020001%2C193.713%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221493%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution is a much discussed but underdeveloped part of international cyber law, particularly when States are the suspected responsible party. This Article will examine the treatment of attribution in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations45 and critique the current state of international attribution law for cyber operations. In a nutshell, Tallinn 2.0 fairly summarizes what amounts to substantially underdeveloped customary international law on attribution of cyber operations. Because cyber attribution remains challenging and often time-consuming when State responsibility is suspected, international law places States in an untenable posture in responding to cyber intrusions below the use of force level. I argue that States, including the United States, must make some difficult tradeoffs between secrecy and transparency and publicly identify some public-infrastructure \"red lines\" and attribution benchmarks that can help States create an international roadmap for deterrence of harmful</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221494%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B75%2C604.613%2C412.0499955000001%2C614.913%5D%2C%5B75.00009%2C592.113%2C412.320488895%2C602.2130000000001%5D%2C%5B75%2C579.113%2C320.047489025%2C589.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221494%22%7D%7D\">cyber intrusions in the future.

Attribution of malicious cyber activity can trace to a machine, to one or more persons operating the machine that initiates the cyber intrusion, and to a person or entity that is found to be ultimately responsible for that activity.106 Attribution is determined by a wide range of facts, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and diplomatic relations, among others.107 The declassified Background to \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections\" reminds us that intelligence analysis of cyber intrusions seeks \"to reduce the uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders' intentions. This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide or obfuscate their activities.\"108 The Intelligence Community assessment reflects \"a series of judgments that describe whether [the intrusion] was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, the perpetrator's possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation.\"109\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221503%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2016, p. 1503</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FS8YZLRXI%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221490%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96%2C385.013%2C409.7939918899999%2C395.313%5D%2C%5B72.99998153200005%2C372.51300000000003%2C410.7915924459999%2C382.813%5D%2C%5B73%2C359.813%2C410.696605499%2C370.113%5D%2C%5B73%2C347.013%2C412.73735834999997%2C357.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B72%2C334.313%2C413.15000000000003%2C344.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B74%2C321.813%2C410.953195112%2C333.5225%5D%2C%5B73%2C309.113%2C411.45079566800007%2C319.513%5D%2C%5B73%2C296.413%2C410.9987772446679%2C306.71299999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FG7KN4SYC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221490%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, on January 6, 2017, after briefing President Obama, Presidentelect Donald Trump, and members of the Senate and House in a classified session on behalf of the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and FBI, DNI James Clapper released an unclassified version of Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber IncidentAttribution.26 Presumably the classified report included the details on Russian attribution.
