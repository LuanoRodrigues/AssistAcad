A state's hackers may or may not be officers in their intelligence services or militaries or they may be independent hackers or even part of criminal groups. Much of the activity that is described as \"state-sponsored\" is in fact carried out by such proxies whose relationship to the state falls in a spectrum from outright delegation of specific missions to non-governmental actors to more ambiguous orchestration and sanctioning of criminal and other hacker groups.7 Moreover, since proxy actors' motivations are multifaceted themselves in that they may be working for their states out of a sense of patriotic motivation, for financial opportunities, or to avoid prison or other penalties, assessing which activities qualify as state-linked is a complicated task.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cExamining the underlying activities raises a key question: are criminal charges better suited to respond to certain kinds of cyber activities? One way to answer this is to consider major cyber incidents for which the U.S. has not brought charges. For instance, the hack of the Office of Personnel Management exposed the records of 21.5 million federal employees - but because the culprit was likely Chinese intelligence services and because they have not released any of the information, U.S. authorities have approached this like a traditional espionage operation and have not taken a law enforcement response. Similar logic may apply to the Shadowbrokers release of NSA toolkits where it is unclear if a nation-state was behind their actions. Of course in this case, the Shadowbrokers did release what they stole. Here, the reason for no charges is likely, in part, that NSA is highly reluctant to allow a public criminal case, which could expose its own intelligence methods and operations. It is puzzling why the U.S. has not brought charges against Russian actors for the NotPetya malware, which the U.S. and allies have already attributed as a clear violation of international norms. Here, the concern about intelligence sources and methods may apply.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 27)", "\u201cThis article has proposed a conceptual framework for understanding criminal charges as an instrument of national cyber policy and discussed considerations for policymakers as they look to use criminal charges to respond to major cyber incidents. One clear conclusion that the framework highlights when applied to the case studies is that criminal charges have demonstrated that the United States now has and is willing to use a robust attribution capability. Thus far criminal charges have largely focused on short-term effects related to informing and providing justice for victims and supporting the technical community and foreign states. However, U.S. policymaking has now moved to a new phase, as the accelerated pace of criminal charges in 2018 shows. In this phase, criminal charges fulfill multiple functions: from diplomatic signaling to enabling other U.S. government actions like sanctions to helping construct international norms of behavior.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 29)", "\u201cTwo related sets of charges straddle the line between state-orchestrated hacking and cybercrime. First, two criminal complaints unsealed in March 2016 laid out charges against three members of the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of \"patriotic\" hackers whose operations aimed to build political support for the Assad regime, for attempting to spear phish U.S. government computer systems and for running an extortion scheme by hacking U.S. companies from 2011 to 2014. Although the Justice Department did not accuse the Syrian government of direct activity in support of the Syrian Electronic Army, it said they carried out the attacks on behalf of the Assad regime. The charges led to the arrest of one individual, Peter Romar, in Germany, who was extradited to the U.S. to face charges related to the extortion scheme.76 In May 2018, the Justice Department unsealed a new set of charges against the two remaining Syrians that detailed their efforts to hack U.S. social media organizations and deface their websites.77\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 24)", "\u201cThird, criminal charges are a necessary predicate for law enforcement actions. This is obvious - federal authorities generally need a grand jury indictment to make an arrest. In this way, unsealed criminal charges both communicate about a cyber incident and form a basis for action in response, specifically against the charged individuals. This is a significant difference from other responses like public statements.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7)", "\u201cNation-state cyber intrusions have led to some of the largest and most consequential thefts and attacks on the United States in recent years. The hack of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 alone put the personal records of 21.5 million federal workers with security clearances in the hands of a foreign government.4 The twin ransomware worms, WannaCry and NotPetya, caused billions in damage to U.S. companies.5 Industry leaders and U.S. intelligence officials have decried the mass theft of intellectual property from U.S. corporations - with former NSA Director Keith Alexander calling it \"the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.6\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 3)", "\u201cSince 2014, the Department of Justice has unsealed, at least, 24 cases and 195 counts against 93 foreign nationals that either explicitly allege or where we have reason to believe foreign state responsibility for malicious cyber activity or foreign influence operations. Sixteen of the 24 have come in the Trump administration.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cIt is in response to the threat of state-sponsored cyber activities that the U.S. government has rolled out a series of new policies - including the 2018 National Cyber Strategy's Cyber Deterrence Initiative and the much-discussed changes to the guidelines for the use of offensive cyber weapons.8 Criminal charges have formed a critical component of the response from the FBI and Department of Justice - which investigate nation-state cyber incidents that affect domestic companies and individuals.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 4)", "\u201cAs of January 2019, the Justice Department has brought five separate cases of criminal charges against Russians for cyber-related crimes. The first charges came only a month after the PLA indictment, and at the time, did not clearly seem to implicate state sponsorship. This was because the indictment was against Evgeniy Bogachev, the administrator of the GameOverZeus botnet, and the Justice Department unsealed the charges concurrently with a major international operation to take down the botnet. Only later reporting and sanctions on Bogachev announced in 2016 revealed that Bogachev was using the botnet to siphon information about Russian intelligence targets as well as to steal bank information.57 The FBI had discovered this before taking down the botnet, and so the planned takedown, which originally just aimed to stop a major criminal operation, also served to disrupt a Russian intelligence gathering effort.58\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cIn September 2018, the Trump administration published its National Cyber Strategy, which outlined an approach to \"preserve peace through strength\" by attributing and deterring malicious cyber behavior using \"all instruments of national power.'92 The Strategy explicitly discusses that \"[f]aw enforcement actions to combat cyber criminal activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring [malicious cyber activity].\" In practice, the administration turned to criminal charges, many of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, and started unsealing ones previously held in reserve, taking advantage of the lowest hanging fruit for these purposes. It is likely that this reservoir of sealed criminal charges has now become depleted.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 29)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C636.913%2C416.74060960800006%2C646.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C623.613%2C418.2467%2C633.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C610.613%2C417.84369755800003%2C620.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C597.8130000000001%2C418.206388224%2C607.7130000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C584.513%2C417.660001666%2C594.413%5D%2C%5B64.9999664%2C571.513%2C418.0067971120001%2C581.413%5D%2C%5B66%2C558.413%2C416.450410272%2C569.9224999999999%5D%2C%5B65%2C545.413%2C417.330001833%2C555.413%5D%2C%5B66%2C532.413%2C417.66440666600005%2C542.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C519.413%2C418.884%2C529.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C506.313%2C140.54049069500002%2C516.213%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cHowever, state involvement in malicious cyber activity is not binary.

The first charges came only a month after the PLA indictment, and at the time, did not clearly seem to implicate state sponsorship. This was because the indictment was against Evgeniy Bogachev, the administrator of the GameOverZeus botnet, and the Justice Department unsealed the charges concurrently with a major international operation to take down the botnet. Only later reporting and sanctions on Bogachev announced in 2016 revealed that Bogachev was using the botnet to siphon information about Russian intelligence targets as well as to steal bank information.57 The FBI had discovered this before taking down the botnet, and so the planned takedown, which originally just aimed to stop a major criminal operation, also served to disrupt a Russian intelligence gathering effort.58\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C283.713%2C418.4176122199999%2C293.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B66%2C270.413%2C418.40000499999996%2C280.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B66%2C257.413%2C418.2467%2C267.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C244.413%2C417.97878000800006%2C255.9225%5D%2C%5B66%2C231.113%2C418.239487505%2C241.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C218.013%2C418.586604888%2C228.013%5D%2C%5B66%2C205.013%2C418.66198778%2C214.913%5D%2C%5B66%2C192.013%2C418.31319611%2C201.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C179.013%2C418.269796665%2C188.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C166.013%2C399.92658908600015%2C175.913%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn September 2018, the Trump administration published its National Cyber Strategy, which outlined an approach to \"preserve peace through strength\" by attributing and deterring malicious cyber behavior using \"all instruments of national power.'92 The Strategy explicitly discusses that \"[f]aw enforcement actions to combat cyber criminal activity serve as an instrument of national power by, among other things, deterring [malicious cyber activity].\" In practice, the administration turned to criminal charges, many of which had been in the works since the Obama administration, and started unsealing ones previously held in reserve, taking advantage of the lowest hanging fruit for these purposes.

The technical community of cybersecurity experts working at private companies in the United States and abroad has often questioned attributions of nation-state activity that do not provide explanations or further evidence detailing how the U.S. arrived at its conclusions. This is not confined to technical experts. Political figures also dispute official attributions - as President Trump did when the U.S. intelligence community attributed the 2016 election interference operations to Russia's GRU and FSB.18 Special Counsel Robert Mueller's two 2018 indictments of Russians for social media hijacking and election hacking helped support the intelligence community's conclusions in the public's eyes.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 9)", "\u201cFirst, criminal charges require a high standard of publicly-releasable evidence.

This limits criminal charges' utility as a policy tool since such evidence may simply not be available in certain cases or not available at the most useful moment to bring charges.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7)", "\u201cThe G-20 had committed to the economic espionage norm, and this collective denouncement took the indictment as evidence to criticize China for breaching its commitments. The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cCriminal charges differ from many other ways of responding to cyber incidents such as formal diplomatic demarches, public statements from senior officials, or punitive actions like sanctions or even offensive cyber operations. They combine a public communications function with a punitive function - and they do so under a particular set of constraints - all of which make criminal charges a unique instrument from a policy perspective. In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cAnother trend is that the number of individuals accused in an unsealed indictment has somewhat increased over time, up to groups of twelve or thirteen people, which suggests a better attribution capability. However, no set of charges has named a high-ranking state official - a fact that may suggest it is difficult to provide evidence of criminal responsibility for those higher on the chain of command but also may indicate that the U.S. has wished to limit indictments' impact on relations with the target state.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 29)", "\u201cAt this point, the U.S. had not formally accused China of violating the 2015 agreement. This was because the actual agreement was narrow - the two nations said they would not employ cyber-enabled espionage to benefit private sector firms. Criminal charges brought to this date either charged non-cyber espionage or named activity that stopped before September 2015. This changed with the Justice Department's December indictment of two MSS officers in connection with a wide-ranging scheme over 12 years to hack managed services providers, which served as IT infrastructure for hundreds of companies.54 This campaign, dubbed \"Cloudhopper\" by the cybersecurity teams at PwC and BAE Systems, was one the most significant and damaging sprees of economic espionage. With the indictment, the U.S. had concrete evidence, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen used as the basis of a joint statement alleging that China violated the accord.55 Moreover, twelve close U.S. allies joined in issuing statements condemning China's behavior.56\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 19)", "\u201cJustice Department officials have commented that if they did not indict state sponsored hackers, they would be sending a message to hackers that they could act with impunity.39 As criminal charges have become a routine feature of U.S. responses to state-sponsored cyber activity, the risk has become that in cases where the U.S. does not unseal an indictment, it signals that it tacitly accepts that activity as permissible.40 In addition, as discussed above, there are often barriers\u201d to criminal charges like inaccessible information, the burden of convincing a grand jury, and timeliness considerations. In some cases, it simply is not possible to bring an indictment because of a lack of admissible evidence pointing to specific individuals.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 16)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C364.213%2C418.022386784%2C374.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.913%2C418.30980772419196%2C360.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C338.113%2C417.459581336%2C348.113%5D%2C%5B65.00007797599994%2C324.813%2C418.2176097199999%2C334.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C311.813%2C418.27013859237616%2C321.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C298.713%2C418.1400926710001%2C308.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C285.41299999999995%2C417.9119380657151%2C295.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65.00001671000001%2C272.213%2C400.70318011200004%2C282.113%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile criminal charges often present detailed evidence gathered on hackers, going as far to present their photos, internet searches, and chat messages to superiors, disclosing such information can provide information about U.S. intelligence collection capabilities to adversaries.

Political figures also dispute official attributions - as President Trump did when the U.S.</span> i<span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C637.13%2C418.3132%2C646.13%5D%2C%5B65%2C623.83%2C418.41549999999995%2C635.1225%5D%2C%5B65.0002%2C610.83%2C418.5%2C619.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C598.0300000000001%2C333.87809999999996%2C607.0300000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%7D\">ntelligence community attributed the 2016 election interference operations to Russia's GRU and FSB.18 Special Counsel Robert Mueller's two 2018 indictments of Russians for social media hijacking and election hacking helped support the intelligence community's conclusions in the public's eyes.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 9</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C376.313%2C417.9419809799999%2C386.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C363.313%2C418.884%2C373.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.313%2C417.401480285%2C360.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C337.313%2C418.884%2C347.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C324.213%2C418.08298978000005%2C336.33475%5D%2C%5B65.00001392799999%2C310.913%2C417.989490005%2C320.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C297.913%2C418.586604888%2C308.19800000000004%5D%2C%5B66%2C285.213%2C418.586604888%2C295.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C271.913%2C418.242945146195%2C283.93475%5D%2C%5B64.99985013000003%2C258.813%2C418.2467%2C268.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C245.813%2C417.90498195%2C255.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C232.713%2C417.83098388999997%2C242.713%5D%2C%5B66.00001506500001%2C219.513%2C418.1356054398809%2C229.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C206.713%2C417.7616152699999%2C216.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C193.413%2C418.66899111000004%2C203.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65.00052316%2C180.413%2C417.87359528%2C190.31300000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst, criminal charges require a high standard of publicly-releasable evidence. To bring criminal charges, federal prosecutors must convince a majority of a grand jury or a federal judge that there is probable cause to believe the defendant is guilty. The prosecutors must then be prepared to prove at a later stage, before a jury, that the defendant is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"11 This is a higher burden of proof - and proof that must lay out its evidence in public and be challenged in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury - compared to the standards of information on which policymakers usually make decisions in the national security space.12 Prosecutors must thus consider whether they actually have the requisite evidence of criminal violations that meets a high standard of proof. This is complicated for cyber incidents where information collected through intelligence means is often inadmissible in a courtroom or would disclose sensitive intelligence sources and methods. In contrast to other ways that the U.S. can point its fingers at adversaries such as a public statement, criminal charges require it to lay out its evidence, show where the evidence was obtained at a high level of detail, and assert that it can hold up in a criminal trial before an</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C636.913%2C418.026806224%2C646.813%5D%2C%5B65.99982406000004%2C623.613%2C417.54401804999986%2C633.513%5D%2C%5B66%2C610.613%2C253.69198348000006%2C620.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">independent judge and jury.

The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B77%2C506.913%2C420.6%2C516.813%5D%2C%5B66%2C493.913%2C418.86320666499995%2C503.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C480.813%2C418.884%2C490.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C468.03%2C418.44%2C477.13%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.813%2C418.37110522200004%2C464.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.513%2C419.826%2C451.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C428.813%2C417.916994725%2C438.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C415.413%2C418.220001722%2C425.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C402.413%2C417.62200783000003%2C412.313%5D%2C%5B66%2C389.413%2C271.614413416%2C399.313%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCriminal charges differ from many other ways of responding to cyber incidents such as formal diplomatic demarches, public statements from senior officials, or punitive actions like sanctions or even offensive cyber operations. They combine a public communications function with a punitive function - and they do so under a particular set of constraints - all of which make criminal charges a unique instrument from a policy perspective. In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C191.813%2C418.41548694500005%2C201.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C179.213%2C418.658491115%2C189.213%5D%2C%5B65%2C166.513%2C418.26309600100006%2C176.513%5D%2C%5B64.999776865%2C153.513%2C418.65959333600006%2C163.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C140.213%2C418.2467%2C150.113%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAnother trend is that the number of individuals accused in an unsealed indictment has somewhat increased over time, up to groups of twelve or thirteen people, which suggests a better attribution capability.

This changed with the Justice Department's December indictment of two MSS officers in connection with a wide-ranging scheme over 12 years to hack managed services providers, which served as IT infrastructure for hundreds of companies.54 This campaign, dubbed \"Cloudhopper\" by the cybersecurity teams at PwC and BAE Systems, was one the most significant and damaging sprees of economic espionage. With the indictment, the U.S. had concrete evidence, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen used as the basis of a joint statement alleging that China violated the accord.55 Moreover, twelve close U.S. allies joined in issuing statements condemning China's behavior.56\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 19</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C328.13%2C418.3098%2C337.22999999999996%5D%2C%5B66%2C315.13%2C418.1088%2C324.13%5D%2C%5B66%2C302.43%2C418.1356%2C313.7225%5D%2C%5B65%2C289.33%2C417.733%2C298.33%5D%2C%5B65%2C276.63%2C418.9%2C285.63%5D%2C%5B66%2C263.22999999999996%2C418.3724%2C274.6225%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJustice Department officials have commented that if they did not indict state sponsored hackers, they would be sending a message to hackers that they could act with impunity.39 As criminal charges have become a routine feature of U.S. responses to state-sponsored cyber activity, the risk has become that in cases where the U.S. does not unseal an indictment, it signals that it tacitly accepts that activity as permissible.40 In addition, as discussed above, there are often barriers\u201d</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2216%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A15%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C636.913%2C418.884%2C646.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C623.613%2C418.07457633964765%2C633.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C610.613%2C417.660002766%2C620.513%5D%2C%5B64.99996750000003%2C597.513%2C135.76698122000002%2C607.413%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%7D\">to criminal charges like inaccessible information, the burden of convincing a grand jury, and timeliness considerations.

This raises both challenges and opportunities for policymakers, since the primary question of interest from a foreign policy perspective is not which person carried out the attack but which state is responsible. For instance, when the FBI attributed the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, it noted the North Korean government was responsible for the attack - but did not name any individuals.13 Naming individuals is challenging especially individuals operating within closed societies like North Korea or within intelligence agencies - so just collecting enough evidence to name specific individuals can be a challenge. But in many instances, even pinpointing a specific individual does not clearly establish state responsibility, as discussed above. When prosecutors unseal criminal charges against hackers acting as a proxy, they could have the choice of whether to allege state sponsorship - and thus modulate or heighten the impact of the criminal charge's accusations.

This raises both challenges and opportunities for policymakers, since the primary question of interest from a foreign policy perspective is not which person carried out the attack but which state is responsible. For instance, when the FBI attributed the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, it noted the North Korean government was responsible for the attack - but did not name any individuals.13 Naming individuals is challenging especially individuals operating within closed societies like North Korea or within intelligence agencies - so just collecting enough evidence to name specific individuals can be a challenge. But in many instances, even pinpointing a specific individual does not clearly establish state responsibility, as discussed above. When prosecutors unseal criminal charges against hackers acting as a proxy, they could have the choice of whether to allege state sponsorship - and thus modulate or heighten the impact of the criminal charge's accusations. And even when the named hackers are integrated into a state's military or intelligence apparatus, policymakers must make choices about the individuals named.

Of the 24 foreign hacking criminal charges brought to date, eight charged defendants related to IP or trade secrets theft. This indicates that the Justice Department has prioritized prosecuting IP theft cases, in part because the U.S. has so strongly opposed statebacked economic espionage. The rest of the criminal charges range from DDoS attacks, to electoral interference via social media, to ransomware, and to extortion schemes. One similarity across cases is a \"hack and release\" strategy: The hack of the DNC is the most prominent example. Others include the OPCW/WADA hacks, the HBO hack, and the Syrian Electronic Army (which was slightly different in that it involved hacking social media channels and posting disinformation). Although the DNC hack arguably violated the implicit norm against cyberenabled election interference that has since been reinforced through explicit statements90 - it is more difficult to delineate exactly what norms each of these activities violates. As discussed above, criminal charges do not necessarily need to aim to punish norm-violating activity, but it is especially interesting that only two indictments (Finance DDOS, SamSam ransomware) came against attacks on critical infrastructure, which is another of the major norms that the U.S. promotes in cyberspace and which the U.S. is most concerned about its adversaries violating.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 27)", "\u201cHowever, it may be possible that by adding more operational friction to adversary hackers - for instance by forcing them to factor the cost of attribution or arrests of their hackers or proxies into their calculations, state-backed hackers might follow much stricter operational security procedures to avoid detection. In this way criminal charges can add costs to constrain the adversary's broader actions. Another form of cost imposition is through \"naming and shaming\" which commentators have often pointed out is unlikely to deter the target state by itself.23 In a theoretical view, naming and shaming works within the wider social system of international states by labeling certain behavior as deviant, mobilizing public opinion and other states to condemn the behavior, and making it more and more costly for the target state to continue its deviations from accepted norms.24 As mentioned, discussion of criminal charges has focused on whether this theory is applicable in practice. These discussions often miss other potential diplomatic goals like pressuring the target state to take a related, affirmative action, such as agreeing not to use certain types of attacks or put certain targets off limit. The 2014 PLA hackers indictment ultimately seemed to play a role in a broader U.S. campaign to put pressure on China to agree not to conduct cyber-enabled economic espionage, which culminated in the September 2015 U.S.-China agreement.25\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cFirst, in terms of attribution, the charges divide neatly into those that the Justice Department brought without the U.S. government having previously attributed the activity and those criminal charges where there was prior attribution. In those that attributed activity to a foreign state for the first time, the criminal charges had a more prominent impact on domestic and international audiences. Internationally, criminal charges like the PLA indictment, the OPCW/ WADA indictment, and the Cloudhopper indictment, provoked consequences in the target state and helped to mobilize allies to condemn the target state's behavior. Domestically, the Yahoo! indictment and the Syrian Electronic Army indictment provided attribution of significant cyber incidents, helping to clarify the perpetrators to the public and to victims. For criminal charges that had prior attribution, there were less clear diplomatic impacts - for instance, the Sony and WannaCry indictment and DNC indictment both responded to very significant incidents, but they did not much alter the U.S. relationship with the target state. Their effects may have been more important domestically because of their political salience, but the criminal charges themselves did not reveal much new, relevant information to the public.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 27)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2215%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C560.13%2C417.1702%2C569.13%5D%2C%5B66%2C547.0300000000001%2C418.2532%2C556.13%5D%2C%5B65%2C534.0300000000001%2C417.78959999999995%2C543.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B66%2C521.0300000000001%2C417.772%2C530.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C508.03%2C417.5034999999999%2C517.03%5D%2C%5B66.00024999999994%2C495.03%2C256.74999975000003%2C506.3225%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs the number of criminal charges increases, particularly against revisionist states like Russia that brush off international opprobrium, criminal charges may prove less viable for certain purposes, especially those related to exerting pressure on adversary governments.

The 2014 PLA hackers indictment ultimately seemed to play a role in a broader U.S. campaign to put pressure on China to agree not to conduct cyber-enabled economic espionage, which culminated in the September 2015 U.S.-China agreement.25\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C324.513%2C418.586604888%2C334.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C311.513%2C417.7531490176602%2C321.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B66.0005353%2C298.413%2C417.91198528000007%2C308.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65.00047151499996%2C285.413%2C417.906390224%2C295.413%5D%2C%5B64.99975976000002%2C272.713%2C418.08848483500026%2C282.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B66%2C259.713%2C418.253484165%2C269.613%5D%2C%5B65%2C246.413%2C418.31319611%2C256.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C233.613%2C417.570486395%2C243.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C220.613%2C418.4154651354801%2C230.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C207.513%2C418.586604888%2C217.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C194.513%2C418.8007791605262%2C204.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst, in terms of attribution, the charges divide neatly into those that the Justice Department brought without the U.S. government having previously attributed the activity and those criminal charges where there was prior attribution.

Unsealing criminal charges helps to clarify which types of activities the U.S. considers as\u201d violating norms, especially if Justice Department officials emphasize this in their public comments. Criminal charges are helpful because they are about a concrete set of actions, rather than the vaguer concepts referred to in norms agreements like \"the proliferation of malicious ICT,\" which can be hard to define in practice.28 When they are a part of a broader set of initiatives to build and enhance international norms, criminal charges can play a role in reinforcing acceptable standards of state behavior. Moreover, as Finnemore and Hollis argue, criminal charges (and accusations more broadly) could play a significant role in shaping customary international law through the emerging opinio juris of legitimate state behavior in this domain.29 In this regard, criminal charges may be contributing to a broader trend in international law toward greater individualization of enforcement measures.30 While it is impossible to assess this development in terms of a single case, it is important to consider how the foreign hacking charges will influence future international norms of behavior in cyberspace.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 12)", "\u201cAdditionally, in terms of diplomacy, criminal charges can be a component of reassurance or partnership with allies and other governments to respond to an incident that has global effects. Criminal charges are increasingly a tool the U.S. deploys as part of joint actions with like-minded governments to attribute and respond to state-backed hacking. As an example, in October 2018, when the governments of the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, as well as the United States jointly attributed a hacking campaign against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and sports anti-doping agencies around the world to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against seven named GRU officers for the same activities.26 However, no U.S. allies have publicly brought their own criminal charges that specifically allege state responsibility for malicious cyber activity, which raises the question whether it is a matter of resources, domestic law, or policy willingness inhibiting other states from pursuing criminal charges.27\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cFirst, in terms of attribution, the charges divide neatly into those that the Justice Department brought without the U.S. government having previously attributed the activity and those criminal charges where there was prior attribution.

Moreover, as Finnemore and Hollis argue, criminal charges (and accusations more broadly) could play a significant role in shaping customary international law through the emerging opinio juris of legitimate state behavior in this domain.29 In this regard, criminal charges may be contributing to a broader trend in international law toward greater individualization of enforcement measures.30 While it is impossible to assess this development in terms of a single case, it is important to consider how the foreign hacking charges will influence future international norms of behavior in cyberspace.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2212%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 12</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C506.913%2C418.2467%2C516.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C493.913%2C417.87359528%2C503.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C480.813%2C418.13560533399993%2C490.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C468.113%2C418.0067971120001%2C478.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.813%2C418.06320916499993%2C464.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.813%2C418.47079738800005%2C451.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B66%2C429.013%2C418.2467%2C439.013%5D%2C%5B66%2C415.713%2C418.0067971120001%2C425.613%5D%2C%5B66%2C403.013%2C417.45957421901596%2C412.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B66%2C389.913%2C417.997704554%2C399.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C376.913%2C418.6130945010001%2C388.93475%5D%2C%5B65%2C363.913%2C417.52538583400025%2C373.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.913%2C418.2467%2C360.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C338.113%2C418.08298978000005%2C348.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C325.113%2C163.125%2C340.63475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAdditionally, in terms of diplomacy, criminal charges can be a component of reassurance or partnership with allies and other governments to respond to an incident that has global effects. Criminal charges are increasingly a tool the U.S. deploys as part of joint actions with like-minded governments to attribute and respond to state-backed hacking. As an example, in October 2018, when the governments of the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, as well as the United States jointly attributed a hacking campaign against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and sports anti-doping agencies around the world to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against seven named GRU officers for the same activities.26 However, no U.S. allies have publicly brought their own criminal charges that specifically allege state responsibility for malicious cyber activity, which raises the question whether it is a matter of resources, domestic law, or policy willingness inhibiting other states from pursuing criminal charges.27\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C324.513%2C418.586604888%2C334.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C311.513%2C417.7531490176602%2C321.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B66.0005353%2C298.413%2C417.91198528000007%2C308.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65.00047151499996%2C285.413%2C417.906390224%2C295.413%5D%2C%5B64.99975976000002%2C272.713%2C418.08848483500026%2C282.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B66%2C259.713%2C418.253484165%2C269.613%5D%2C%5B65%2C246.413%2C418.31319611%2C256.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C233.613%2C417.570486395%2C243.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C220.613%2C418.4154651354801%2C230.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C207.513%2C418.586604888%2C217.513%5D%2C%5B65%2C194.513%2C418.8007791605262%2C204.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst, in terms of attribution, the charges divide neatly into those that the Justice Department brought without the U.S. government having previously attributed the activity and those criminal charges where there was prior attribution.

Prosecutors must strike a balance on what to disclose and how quickly they do so without compromising ongoing intelligence sources and methods. Conversely, it is sometimes advantageous to reveal U.S. government attribution capabilities because it removes doubt about attributions by showing exactly how the U.S. government obtained that information.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 14)", "\u201cThird, in cases where the U.S. government has already made a formal attribution, criminal charges can buttress these claims with detailed technical evidence. The technical community of cybersecurity experts working at private companies in the United States and abroad has often questioned attributions of nation-state activity that do not provide explanations or further evidence detailing how the U.S. arrived at its conclusions. This is not confined to technical experts. Political figures also dispute official attributions - as President Trump did when the U.S. intelligence community attributed the 2016 election interference operations to Russia's GRU and FSB.18 Special Counsel Robert Mueller's two 2018 indictments of Russians for social media hijacking and election hacking helped support the intelligence community's conclusions in the public's eyes.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 9)", "\u201cAnother trend is that the number of individuals accused in an unsealed indictment has somewhat increased over time, up to groups of twelve or thirteen people, which suggests a better attribution capability. However, no set of charges has named a high-ranking state official - a fact that may suggest it is difficult to provide evidence of criminal responsibility for those higher on the chain of command but also may indicate that the U.S. has wished to limit indictments' impact on relations with the target state.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 29)", "\u201cMalicious activity, particularly that which has an immediate public impact like the 2011-2013 DDoS attacks or the 2016 hack of the DNC, creates pressure on the U.S. government to respond quickly. Criminal charges are often a poor solution to this problem because it takes time to investigate, compile rigorous evidence, and then convince a grand jury to approve the criminal charge. One indictment unsealed in 2018 referenced malicious activity from 2011 through 2015. It took Justice Department prosecutors until summer 2018 to unseal charges against GRU officers for hacking the DNC in 2016.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 15)", "\u201cFirst, criminal charges require a high standard of publicly-releasable evidence. To bring criminal charges, federal prosecutors must convince a majority of a grand jury or a federal judge that there is probable cause to believe the defendant is guilty. The prosecutors must then be prepared to prove at a later stage, before a jury, that the defendant is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"11 This is a higher burden of proof - and proof that must lay out its evidence in public and be challenged in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury - compared to the standards of information on which policymakers usually make decisions in the national security space.12 Prosecutors must thus consider whether they actually have the requisite evidence of criminal violations that meets a high standard of proof. This is complicated for cyber incidents where information collected through intelligence means is often inadmissible in a courtroom or would disclose sensitive intelligence sources and methods. In contrast to other ways that the U.S. can point its fingers at adversaries such as a public statement, criminal charges require it to lay out its evidence, show where the evidence was obtained at a high level of detail, and assert that it can hold up in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury. This limits criminal charges' utility as a policy tool since such evidence may simply not be available in certain cases or not available at the most useful moment to bring charges.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7)", "\u201cSecond, criminal charges are individual-centric. This raises both challenges and opportunities for policymakers, since the primary question of interest from a foreign policy perspective is not which person carried out the attack but which state is responsible. For instance, when the FBI attributed the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, it noted the North Korean government was responsible for the attack - but did not name any individuals.13 Naming individuals is challenging especially individuals operating within closed societies like North Korea or within intelligence agencies - so just collecting enough evidence to name specific individuals can be a challenge. But in many instances, even pinpointing a specific individual does not clearly establish state responsibility, as discussed above. When prosecutors unseal criminal charges against hackers acting as a proxy, they could have the choice of whether to allege state sponsorship - and thus modulate or heighten the impact of the criminal charge's accusations. And even when the named hackers are integrated into a state's military or intelligence apparatus, policymakers must make choices about the individuals named. How high up the chain of command should they go, that is, to what extent can they prove a criminal conspiracy among higher officers? What effects will disclosing the identities of these officers have?\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7)", "\u201cThe G-20 had committed to the economic espionage norm, and this collective denouncement took the indictment as evidence to criticize China for breaching its commitments. The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cCriminal charges differ from many other ways of responding to cyber incidents such as formal diplomatic demarches, public statements from senior officials, or punitive actions like sanctions or even offensive cyber operations. They combine a public communications function with a punitive function - and they do so under a particular set of constraints - all of which make criminal charges a unique instrument from a policy perspective. In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C364.213%2C418.022386784%2C374.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.913%2C418.30980772419196%2C360.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C338.113%2C417.459581336%2C348.113%5D%2C%5B65.00007797599994%2C324.813%2C418.2176097199999%2C334.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C311.813%2C418.27013859237616%2C321.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C298.713%2C418.1400926710001%2C308.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C285.41299999999995%2C417.9119380657151%2C295.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65.00001671000001%2C272.213%2C400.70318011200004%2C282.113%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile criminal charges often present detailed evidence gathered on hackers, going as far to present their photos, internet searches, and chat messages to superiors, disclosing such information can provide information about U.S. intelligence collection capabilities to adversaries.

It took Justice Department prosecutors until summer 2018 to unseal charges against GRU officers for hacking the DNC in 2016.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2215%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 15</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C376.313%2C417.9419809799999%2C386.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C363.313%2C418.884%2C373.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.313%2C417.401480285%2C360.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C337.313%2C418.884%2C347.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C324.213%2C418.08298978000005%2C336.33475%5D%2C%5B65.00001392799999%2C310.913%2C417.989490005%2C320.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C297.913%2C418.586604888%2C308.19800000000004%5D%2C%5B66%2C285.213%2C418.586604888%2C295.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C271.913%2C418.242945146195%2C283.93475%5D%2C%5B64.99985013000003%2C258.813%2C418.2467%2C268.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C245.813%2C417.90498195%2C255.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C232.713%2C417.83098388999997%2C242.713%5D%2C%5B66.00001506500001%2C219.513%2C418.1356054398809%2C229.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C206.713%2C417.7616152699999%2C216.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C193.413%2C418.66899111000004%2C203.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65.00052316%2C180.413%2C417.87359528%2C190.31300000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst, criminal charges require a high standard of publicly-releasable evidence. To bring criminal charges, federal prosecutors must convince a majority of a grand jury or a federal judge that there is probable cause to believe the defendant is guilty. The prosecutors must then be prepared to prove at a later stage, before a jury, that the defendant is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"11 This is a higher burden of proof - and proof that must lay out its evidence in public and be challenged in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury - compared to the standards of information on which policymakers usually make decisions in the national security space.12 Prosecutors must thus consider whether they actually have the requisite evidence of criminal violations that meets a high standard of proof. This is complicated for cyber incidents where information collected through intelligence means is often inadmissible in a courtroom or would disclose sensitive intelligence sources and methods. In contrast to other ways that the U.S. can point its fingers at adversaries such as a public statement, criminal charges require it to lay out its evidence, show where the evidence was obtained at a high level of detail, and assert that it can hold up in a criminal trial before an</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C636.913%2C418.026806224%2C646.813%5D%2C%5B65.99982406000004%2C623.613%2C417.54401804999986%2C633.513%5D%2C%5B66%2C610.613%2C253.69198348000006%2C620.513%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">independent judge and jury.

This raises both challenges and opportunities for policymakers, since the primary question of interest from a foreign policy perspective is not which person carried out the attack but which state is responsible. For instance, when the FBI attributed the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014, it noted the North Korean government was responsible for the attack - but did not name any individuals.13 Naming individuals is challenging especially individuals operating within closed societies like North Korea or within intelligence agencies - so just collecting enough evidence to name specific individuals can be a challenge. But in many instances, even pinpointing a specific individual does not clearly establish state responsibility, as discussed above. When prosecutors unseal criminal charges against hackers acting as a proxy, they could have the choice of whether to allege state sponsorship - and thus modulate or heighten the impact of the criminal charge's accusations. And even when the named hackers are integrated into a state's military or intelligence apparatus, policymakers must make choices about the individuals named. How high up the chain of command should they go, that is, to what extent can they prove a criminal conspiracy among higher officers? What effects will disclosing the identities of these officers have?\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C637.13%2C418.2127999999999%2C646.13%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe G-20 had committed to the economic espionage norm, and this collective</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.99959999999999%2C623.83%2C418.261%2C632.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C610.83%2C125.367%2C619.83%5D%2C%5B76%2C598.0300000000001%2C417.8437%2C607.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C585.0300000000001%2C418.0254%2C594.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C571.9300000000001%2C417.3169999999999%2C581.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C558.9300000000001%2C418.26310000000007%2C568.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B66%2C545.9300000000001%2C418.38300000000004%2C555.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C532.9300000000001%2C417.8983999999999%2C541.9300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C519.9300000000001%2C418.243%2C528.9300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C506.83%2C418.2467%2C515.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C493.83%2C418.1799%2C502.83%5D%2C%5B66%2C480.72999999999996%2C418.09119999999996%2C489.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C467.72999999999996%2C418.4549%2C476.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.72999999999996%2C417.60310000000004%2C463.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.72999999999996%2C418.06319759999997%2C450.72999999999996%5D%2C%5B65%2C429.03%2C418.61449999999996%2C438.03%5D%2C%5B65%2C415.63%2C206.70880000000002%2C424.63%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">denouncement took the indictment as evidence to criticize China for breaching its commitments. The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B77%2C506.913%2C420.6%2C516.813%5D%2C%5B66%2C493.913%2C418.86320666499995%2C503.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C480.813%2C418.884%2C490.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C468.03%2C418.44%2C477.13%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.813%2C418.37110522200004%2C464.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.513%2C419.826%2C451.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C428.813%2C417.916994725%2C438.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C415.413%2C418.220001722%2C425.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C402.413%2C417.62200783000003%2C412.313%5D%2C%5B66%2C389.413%2C271.614413416%2C399.313%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCriminal charges differ from many other ways of responding to cyber incidents such as formal diplomatic demarches, public statements from senior officials, or punitive actions like sanctions or even offensive cyber operations. They combine a public communications function with a punitive function - and they do so under a particular set of constraints - all of which make criminal charges a unique instrument from a policy perspective. In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\"

To bring criminal charges, federal prosecutors must convince a majority of a grand jury or a federal judge that there is probable cause to believe the defendant is guilty. The prosecutors must then be prepared to prove at a later stage, before a jury, that the defendant is guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"11 This is a higher burden of proof - and proof that must lay out its evidence in public and be challenged in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury - compared to the standards of information on which policymakers usually make decisions in the national security space.12 Prosecutors must thus consider whether they actually have the requisite evidence of criminal violations that meets a high standard of proof. This is complicated for cyber incidents where information collected through intelligence means is often inadmissible in a courtroom or would disclose sensitive intelligence sources and methods. In contrast to other ways that the U.S. can point its fingers at adversaries such as a public statement, criminal charges require it to lay out its evidence, show where the evidence was obtained at a high level of detail, and assert that it can hold up in a criminal trial before an independent judge and jury. This limits criminal charges' utility as a policy tool since such evidence may simply not be available in certain cases or not available at the most useful moment to bring charges.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 7)", "\u201cWhile criminal charges often present detailed evidence gathered on hackers, going as far to present their photos, internet searches, and chat messages to superiors, disclosing such information can provide information about U.S. intelligence collection capabilities to adversaries. Prosecutors must strike a balance on what to disclose and how quickly they do so without compromising ongoing intelligence sources and methods. Conversely, it is sometimes advantageous to reveal U.S. government attribution capabilities because it removes doubt about attributions by showing exactly how the U.S. government obtained that information.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 14)", "\u201cCriminal charges differ from many other ways of responding to cyber incidents such as formal diplomatic demarches, public statements from senior officials, or punitive actions like sanctions or even offensive cyber operations. They combine a public communications function with a punitive function - and they do so under a particular set of constraints - all of which make criminal charges a unique instrument from a policy perspective. In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cThe G-20 had committed to the economic espionage norm, and this collective denouncement took the indictment as evidence to criticize China for breaching its commitments. The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20)", "\u201cThird, in cases where the U.S. government has already made a formal attribution, criminal charges can buttress these claims with detailed technical evidence. The technical community of cybersecurity experts working at private companies in the United States and abroad has often questioned attributions of nation-state activity that do not provide explanations or further evidence detailing how the U.S. arrived at its conclusions. This is not confined to technical experts. Political figures also dispute official attributions - as President Trump did when the U.S. intelligence community attributed the 2016 election interference operations to Russia's GRU and FSB.18 Special Counsel Robert Mueller's two 2018 indictments of Russians for social media hijacking and election hacking helped support the intelligence community's conclusions in the public's eyes.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 9)", "\u201cAnother trend is that the number of individuals accused in an unsealed indictment has somewhat increased over time, up to groups of twelve or thirteen people, which suggests a better attribution capability. However, no set of charges has named a high-ranking state official - a fact that may suggest it is difficult to provide evidence of criminal responsibility for those higher on the chain of command but also may indicate that the U.S. has wished to limit indictments' impact on relations with the target state.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 29)", "\u201cMalicious activity, particularly that which has an immediate public impact like the 2011-2013 DDoS attacks or the 2016 hack of the DNC, creates pressure on the U.S. government to respond quickly. Criminal charges are often a poor solution to this problem because it takes time to investigate, compile rigorous evidence, and then convince a grand jury to approve the criminal charge. One indictment unsealed in 2018 referenced malicious activity from 2011 through 2015. It took Justice Department prosecutors until summer 2018 to unseal charges against GRU officers for hacking the DNC in 2016.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 15)", "\u201cThe October 2018 indictment also pointed to an interesting behavior: the Russian government took the OPCW's efforts to investigate the Skripal attack and WADA's investigations of its doping program seriously enough to try to hack those organizations and try to discredit them. Naming and shaming pressured Russia to do something, except that something was more aggressive hacking to discredit shaming efforts, supporting the already-sizeable body of evidence that Russia was responsible for the Skripal attack.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 22)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C376.313%2C417.9419809799999%2C386.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C363.313%2C418.884%2C373.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.313%2C417.401480285%2C360.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C337.313%2C418.884%2C347.21299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C324.213%2C418.08298978000005%2C336.33475%5D%2C%5B65.00001392799999%2C310.913%2C417.989490005%2C320.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C297.913%2C418.586604888%2C308.19800000000004%5D%2C%5B66%2C285.213%2C418.586604888%2C295.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C271.913%2C418.242945146195%2C283.93475%5D%2C%5B64.99985013000003%2C258.813%2C418.2467%2C268.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B65%2C245.813%2C417.90498195%2C255.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C232.713%2C417.83098388999997%2C242.713%5D%2C%5B66.00001506500001%2C219.513%2C418.1356054398809%2C229.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C206.713%2C417.7616152699999%2C216.713%5D%2C%5B65%2C193.413%2C418.66899111000004%2C203.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65.00052316%2C180.413%2C417.87359528%2C190.31300000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFirst, criminal charges require a high standard of publicly-releasable evidence.

In brief, criminal charges stand apart because (1) they require the presentation of evidence to either a grand jury or a judge with an attestation that the U.S. government can prove its allegations in a public trial; (2) they target specific individuals, not states writ large; (3) they are intended to enable arrests as opposed to just being public statements.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C637.13%2C418.2127999999999%2C646.13%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe G-20 had committed to the economic espionage norm, and this collective</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B64.99959999999999%2C623.83%2C418.261%2C632.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C610.83%2C125.367%2C619.83%5D%2C%5B76%2C598.0300000000001%2C417.8437%2C607.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C585.0300000000001%2C418.0254%2C594.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C571.9300000000001%2C417.3169999999999%2C581.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C558.9300000000001%2C418.26310000000007%2C568.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B66%2C545.9300000000001%2C418.38300000000004%2C555.0300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C532.9300000000001%2C417.8983999999999%2C541.9300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C519.9300000000001%2C418.243%2C528.9300000000001%5D%2C%5B65%2C506.83%2C418.2467%2C515.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C493.83%2C418.1799%2C502.83%5D%2C%5B66%2C480.72999999999996%2C418.09119999999996%2C489.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C467.72999999999996%2C418.4549%2C476.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.72999999999996%2C417.60310000000004%2C463.83%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.72999999999996%2C418.06319759999997%2C450.72999999999996%5D%2C%5B65%2C429.03%2C418.61449999999996%2C438.03%5D%2C%5B65%2C415.63%2C206.70880000000002%2C424.63%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">denouncement took the indictment as evidence to criticize China for breaching its commitments. The China charges follow a very clear trajectory and focus on one principal activity: economic espionage. The Justice Department has not brought charges explicitly related to other types of malicious activity, even though there is evidence that China has sponsored it, such as the OPM breach. As the United States has aimed to curb China's activities along these lines, charges in 2014 helped provide the impetus for the 2015 U.S.-China agreement not to use cyber means for economic espionage. These criminal charges also had a more global effect: contributing to the anti-economic espionage norm at the G-20. However, the threat of future criminal charges clearly proved insufficient to enforce the norm against China. The series of criminal charges in late 2018 is perhaps the most strongly interlinked, mutually supportive set of criminal charges against any target state, but it is too soon to fully evaluate the long-term consequences. One early assessment is that the U.S. looks to use its criminal charges to mobilize allies and like minded states internationally against norms violators more than to punish, deter, or engage the direct target states.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76.00011101199999%2C298.41299999999995%2C417.9119609510001%2C308.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65.00044718599997%2C285.413%2C417.9419809799999%2C295.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C272.413%2C417.336164639172%2C282.41299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C259.413%2C417.92618600200024%2C269.313%5D%2C%5B66%2C246.413%2C418.586604888%2C256.313%5D%2C%5B65%2C233.313%2C418.34038666399994%2C243.213%5D%2C%5B66%2C220.313%2C418.13560353399794%2C230.213%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThird, in cases where the U.S. government has already made a formal attribution, criminal charges can buttress these claims with detailed technical evidence.

Unsealing criminal charges helps to clarify which types of activities the U.S. considers as\u201d violating norms, especially if Justice Department officials emphasize this in their public comments. Criminal charges are helpful because they are about a concrete set of actions, rather than the vaguer concepts referred to in norms agreements like \"the proliferation of malicious ICT,\" which can be hard to define in practice.28 When they are a part of a broader set of initiatives to build and enhance international norms, criminal charges can play a role in reinforcing acceptable standards of state behavior. Moreover, as Finnemore and Hollis argue, criminal charges (and accusations more broadly) could play a significant role in shaping customary international law through the emerging opinio juris of legitimate state behavior in this domain.29 In this regard, criminal charges may be contributing to a broader trend in international law toward greater individualization of enforcement measures.30 While it is impossible to assess this development in terms of a single case, it is important to consider how the foreign hacking charges will influence future international norms of behavior in cyberspace.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 12)", "\u201cThen-Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice, John Carlin, a key official responsible for the initial push on indictments of state-linked hackers, wrote about the integration of law enforcement into a \"whole of government approach\" to combating cyber threats in 2016.9 With the significantly larger number of criminal charges now publicly available, the time is ripe for a policy-focused analysis of the use of charges to complement other emerging literature on the topic, focusing on indictments in the context of deterrence of offensive cyber operations, as well as on the formation of norms of international behavior in cyberspace.10\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6)", "\u201cAdditionally, in terms of diplomacy, criminal charges can be a component of reassurance or partnership with allies and other governments to respond to an incident that has global effects. Criminal charges are increasingly a tool the U.S. deploys as part of joint actions with like-minded governments to attribute and respond to state-backed hacking. As an example, in October 2018, when the governments of the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, as well as the United States jointly attributed a hacking campaign against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and sports anti-doping agencies around the world to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against seven named GRU officers for the same activities.26 However, no U.S. allies have publicly brought their own criminal charges that specifically allege state responsibility for malicious cyber activity, which raises the question whether it is a matter of resources, domestic law, or policy willingness inhibiting other states from pursuing criminal charges.27\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11)", "\u201cAlthough discussions of Iran's cyber threat have focused on the DDoS attacks detailed in a March 2016 indictment68, the first criminal charges against an Iranlinked hacker came in 2013, against a single individual who was arrested in Turkey and then extradited to the U.S. in December 2015 to face charges related to hacking an engineering company in Vermont to steal valuable IP. This man, Nima Golestaneh, pled guilty, but court documents did not reveal much until 2017, when the Justice Department unsealed a follow-on indictment against two other Iranians where it alleged that they engaged in a scheme to steal IP related to missile guidance systems and then to provide that to the Iranian military, in\u201d violation of U.S. export controls.69 However, at this time, Golestaneh was out of U.S. custody. President Obama gave him a conditional pardon as part of negotiations for the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.70\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 23)", "\u201cFirst, in terms of attribution, the charges divide neatly into those that the Justice Department brought without the U.S. government having previously attributed the activity and those criminal charges where there was prior attribution. In those that attributed activity to a foreign state for the first time, the criminal charges had a more prominent impact on domestic and international audiences. Internationally, criminal charges like the PLA indictment, the OPCW/ WADA indictment, and the Cloudhopper indictment, provoked consequences in the target state and helped to mobilize allies to condemn the target state's behavior. Domestically, the Yahoo! indictment and the Syrian Electronic Army indictment provided attribution of significant cyber incidents, helping to clarify the perpetrators to the public and to victims. For criminal charges that had prior attribution, there were less clear diplomatic impacts - for instance, the Sony and WannaCry indictment and DNC indictment both responded to very significant incidents, but they did not much alter the U.S. relationship with the target state. Their effects may have been more important domestically because of their political salience, but the criminal charges themselves did not reveal much new, relevant information to the public.\u201d (Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 27)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C311.813%2C416.7176128449999%2C321.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B64.99984374999997%2C299.013%2C417.98298378%2C309.013%5D%2C%5B65.00022607200003%2C286.013%2C417.83019583500004%2C295.91299999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, in the long-term, criminal charges contribute to the United States' effort to build and enforce norms and rules of the road for cyberspace.

Moreover, as Finnemore and Hollis argue, criminal charges (and accusations more broadly) could play a significant role in shaping customary international law through the emerging opinio juris of legitimate state behavior in this domain.29 In this regard, criminal charges may be contributing to a broader trend in international law toward greater individualization of enforcement measures.30 While it is impossible to assess this development in terms of a single case, it is important to consider how the foreign hacking charges will influence future international norms of behavior in cyberspace.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2212%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 12</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C217.63000000000002%2C418.2467%2C226.73000000000002%5D%2C%5B65%2C204.413%2C417.47018133200004%2C214.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C191.413%2C418.884%2C201.413%5D%2C%5B65%2C178.513%2C418.586604888%2C192.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B66%2C165.313%2C419.02459466600004%2C175.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65%2C152.313%2C418.3720102749999%2C162.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65%2C139.613%2C418.2467%2C149.613%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThen-Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice, John Carlin, a key official responsible for the initial push on indictments of state-linked hackers, wrote about the integration of law enforcement into a \"whole of government approach\" to combating cyber threats in 2016.9 With the significantly larger number of criminal charges now publicly available, the time is ripe for a policy-focused analysis of the use of charges to complement other emerging literature on the topic, focusing on indictments in the context of</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B65%2C636.913%2C418.2467%2C646.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C623.613%2C230.125%2C635.63475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">deterrence of offensive cyber operations, as well as on the formation of norms of international behavior in cyberspace.10\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C506.913%2C418.2467%2C516.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C493.913%2C417.87359528%2C503.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C480.813%2C418.13560533399993%2C490.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C468.113%2C418.0067971120001%2C478.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C454.813%2C418.06320916499993%2C464.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C441.813%2C418.47079738800005%2C451.71299999999997%5D%2C%5B66%2C429.013%2C418.2467%2C439.013%5D%2C%5B66%2C415.713%2C418.0067971120001%2C425.613%5D%2C%5B66%2C403.013%2C417.45957421901596%2C412.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B66%2C389.913%2C417.997704554%2C399.91299999999995%5D%2C%5B65%2C376.913%2C418.6130945010001%2C388.93475%5D%2C%5B65%2C363.913%2C417.52538583400025%2C373.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C350.913%2C418.2467%2C360.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C338.113%2C418.08298978000005%2C348.113%5D%2C%5B65%2C325.113%2C163.125%2C340.63475%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAdditionally, in terms of diplomacy, criminal charges can be a component of reassurance or partnership with allies and other governments to respond to an incident that has global effects. Criminal charges are increasingly a tool the U.S. deploys as part of joint actions with like-minded governments to attribute and respond to state-backed hacking. As an example, in October 2018, when the governments of the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, as well as the United States jointly attributed a hacking campaign against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), and sports anti-doping agencies around the world to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment against seven named GRU officers for the same activities.26 However, no U.S. allies have publicly brought their own criminal charges that specifically allege state responsibility for malicious cyber activity, which raises the question whether it is a matter of resources, domestic law, or policy willingness inhibiting other states from pursuing criminal charges.27\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Hinck e Maurer, 2019, p. 11</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FSUR9I99E%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B76%2C299.913%2C418.15847332928496%2C309.813%5D%2C%5B65%2C286.913%2C418.401490285%2C298.93475%5D%2C%5B65%2C274.113%2C418.31319611%2C284.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C261.113%2C417.57047525213994%2C271.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C248.013%2C418.70599014%2C258.013%5D%2C%5B65%2C235.313%2C418.440392664%2C245.31300000000002%5D%2C%5B65%2C222.313%2C418.60000749999995%2C232.213%5D%2C%5B65%2C209.013%2C418.31319611%2C218.913%5D%2C%5B65%2C196.013%2C418.31319611%2C205.913%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQGZYZT84%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAlthough discussions of Iran's cyber threat have focused on the DDoS attacks detailed in a March 2016 indictment68, the first criminal charges against an Iranlinked hacker came in 2013, against a single individual who was arrested in Turkey and then extradited to the U.S. in December 2015 to face charges related to hacking an engineering company in Vermont to steal valuable IP.
