For instance, whereas the UK National Cyber Security Centre relied on the assessment \u2018with high confidence\u2019 that the GRU was \u2018almost certainly responsible\u2019, which is \u201895%+\u2019 for a list of cyber operations,159 this evidence remained undisclosed.160 Thus, \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 reflected a \u2018name and shame\u2019 mode and did not represent attribution for the purposes of calling a particular state responsible.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 157)", "\u201cCyber incidents have become daily events; moreover, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 triggered a significant growth in malicious cyber operations. For instance, the FBI reported about a 300 per cent increase in cyber security complaints just in the wake of the pandemic.1 Only some of the cyber operations taking place around the world are suspected of being statesponsored. In 2020 about 88 allegedly interstate operations, mostly espionage, were reported.2 According to the Council of Foreign Relations, which has tracked significant cyber operations since 2005, 36 states are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations; in this list China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are designated as responsible for 77 per cent of all cyber operations of this type.3\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 136)", "\u201cThe Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs articulated that \u2018it cannot be ruled out that a cyber operation with a very serious financial or economic impact may qualify as the use of force\u2019.95 Finally, the UK Cyber Primer, although acknowledging the necessity for a cyber operation to cause \u2018the same or similar effects as a kinetic attack\u2019, in a footnote included a clarification permitting such a qualification for attacks, like \u2018a sustained attack against the UK banking system, which could cause severe financial damage to the state, leading to a worsening economic security situation for the population\u2019.96\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 149)", "\u201cBoth the policymaking on general (non-cyber) sanctions and the scientific discussion around such political responses are based largely on the assumption that the main purpose of sanctions is to change the target\u2019s behaviour.200 While the US cyber-related sanctions instruments (namely, Executive Order 13694, Executive Order 14024, CAATSA) do not indicate any objectives in implementing sanctions, except for the necessity to respond to cyber incidents that threaten national security, political documents issued in relation to sanctions imposition in some cases shed light on the sender\u2019s intentions. Thus, the Fact Sheet published by the White House in connection with the adoption of Executive Order 14024 indicates the explicit intention of the Biden administration to \u2018signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilizing international actions\u2019.201 The EU Council states in its Sanctions Guidelines a different aim: to coerce the target to change its objectionable course of action.202 According to the Council, the EU imposes restrictive measures \u2018to bring about a change in policy or activity by the target country, part of the country, government, entities or individuals, in line with the objectives set out in the [Common Foreign and Security Policy] Council Decision\u2019.203 The particular legal instruments that implement sanctions are intended, in general, to incentivise the required change in the target\u2019s policy or activity and, at the same time, clearly indicate the specific objective of the imposed restrictive measures in line with the general goal of coercion.204 Interestingly, the EU Regulation 2019/796 indicates the necessity \u2018to deter and respond to cyberattacks\u2019 as the goals of establishing the framework for EU targeted cyber security-restrictive measures.205 The goals of the EU cyber-related sanctions regime, at least as they are stated in the applicable policy tools, are not limited to coercion but include also constraining and deterrent effects. The UK Cyber Regulations 2020 do not specify the goal of sanctions imposition, while the relevant guidance rather cautiously formulates it as \u2018prevention of relevant cyber activity\u2019.20\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 164)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5F79G29F%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22149%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B63.0425%2C453.6543756%2C374.16661120999987%2C462.2444615%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C442.14526050999996%2C374.1586111299999%2C450.73534641%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C430.69314598999995%2C374.1576111199999%2C439.28323188999997%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C419.1840308999999%2C374.14061095%2C427.77411679999994%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C407.6749158099999%2C374.11461069000006%2C416.2650017099999%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C396.1058001199999%2C374.1606111499998%2C406.1059001199999%5D%2C%5B51.023379809999966%2C384.5966850299999%2C374.16674157%2C395.67749%5D%2C%5B51.022510160000024%2C373.14996050999997%2C374.13374123999984%2C381.74004641%5D%2C%5B51.022510160000024%2C361.69784598999996%2C374.15805959999994%2C372.66008999999997%5D%2C%5B51.0236%2C350.18977559999996%2C194.72505960000004%2C361.15139%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQIP2P6JZ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22149%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTurning to the applicability of jus in bello norms to cyber operations, can we truly celebrate that the states answer this question in the affirmative?

the policymaking on general (non-cyber) sanctions and the scientific discussion around such political responses are based largely on the assumption that the main purpose of sanctions is to change the target\u2019s behaviour.200 While the US cyber-related sanctions instruments (namely, Executive Order 13694, Executive Order 14024, CAATSA) do not indicate any objectives in implementing sanctions, except for the necessity to respond to cyber incidents that threaten national security, political documents issued in relation to sanctions imposition in some cases shed light on the sender\u2019s intentions. Thus, the Fact Sheet published by the White House in connection with the adoption of Executive Order 14024 indicates the explicit intention of the Biden administration to \u2018signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilizing international actions\u2019.201 The EU Council states in its Sanctions Guidelines a different aim: to coerce the target to change its objectionable course of action.202 According to the Council, the EU imposes restrictive measures \u2018to bring about a change in policy or activity by the target country, part of the country, government, entities or individuals, in line with the objectives set out in the [Common Foreign and Security Policy] Council Decision\u2019.203 The particular legal instruments that implement sanctions are intended, in general, to incentivise the required change in the target\u2019s policy or activity and, at the same time, clearly indicate the specific objective of the imposed restrictive measures in line with the general goal of coercion.204 Interestingly, the EU Regulation 2019/796 indicates the necessity \u2018to deter and respond to cyberattacks\u2019 as the goals of establishing the framework for EU targeted cyber security-restrictive measures.205 The goals of the EU cyber-related sanctions regime, at least as they are stated in the applicable policy tools, are not limited to coercion but include also constraining and deterrent effects. The UK Cyber Regulations 2020 do not specify the goal of sanctions imposition, while the relevant guidance rather cautiously formulates it as \u2018prevention of relevant cyber activity\u2019.20\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQIP2P6JZ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22164%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 164</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Vera Rusinova, Ekaterina Martynova", "date": "2024", "journal": "Israel Law Review", "title": "Fighting Cyber Attacks with Sanctions: Digital Threats, Economic Responses", "abstract": "This article contributes to the understanding of why states resort to targeted, or smart, sanctions to meet the threat of cyber intrusions and whether this type of response is a forced measure or an effective tool to halt, prevent and punish attacking states.

Standards that may be relevant for setting the boundaries of outlawed cyber activities are constrained by the reference to lex lata international law and, as a general safeguard, these \u2018norms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law\u2019.138\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 154)", "\u201cThe application of another set of norms \u2013 international human rights law to alleged interstate cyber operations is also theoretically possible in respect of cyber operations, which, inter alia, can intrude into privacy, freedom of expression and association (following the concept of \u2018human rights online\u2019).109 However, this is dependent on the extent to which the norms of the human rights treaties110 can be applied extraterritorially.111 Since the UN Human Rights Committee112 and later the ICJ113 admitted a disjunctive approach to the reading of the \u2018within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction\u2019 clause of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights114 and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has elaborated spatial (control over the territory or a limited space115) and personal approaches (control and authority over the individuals116) to the notion of \u2018jurisdiction\u2019,117 contained in the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), it is possible to extend the application of these treaties to extraterritorial modes of data interception.118 At least three cases adjudicated by the ECtHR prove that this is not a purely hypothetical scenario: Weber and Saravia v Germany,119 Liberty v United Kingdom,120 and Big Brother Watch and Others v United Kingdom.121\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 152)", "\u201cThe stance that cyberspace is far from being a \u2018wild west\u2019 and is governed by non-cyber-specific norms of international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations,58 is well represented in legal scholarship59 and \u2013 at least, as a matter of principle \u2013 affirmed by states.60 However, even this level of abstraction is not free from disagreement.61 The Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was unable to adopt final reports in 20162017 because of the position articulated by Cuba,62 and backed by Russia63 and China.64 According to this, the applicability of jus ad bellum and jus in bello (international humanitarian law) may lead to the establishment of the \u2018equivalence between the malicious use of [information and communication technologies] and the concept of \u201carmed attack\u201d\u201965 under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and thereby militarise the use of and the response to information and communication technologies (ICTs). The same divergence was found in the positions of states expressed at the OEWG meetings in 2019 and 2020.66 While the majority of states confirmed the applicability of international law in its entirety to cyberspace,67 it was contested by a group of states that used arguments related to the importance of state consent for the extension of the scope of non-cyber-specific norms, indeterminate thresholds of \u2018armed attack\u2019 by cyber means, and the doubtful applicability of international humanitarian law to hybrid warfare and to civilian perpetrators of cyber attacks.68 Some states took an intermediate position by appealing to the need to adopt new legally binding instruments.69 In its report of 2021 the GGE finally acknowledged the applicability of international humanitarian law, but highlighted that these norms apply \u2018only in situations of armed conflict\u2019.70 This acknowledgement is ambivalent, as the question of whether a particular operation with the use of ICTs can be qualified as \u2018an armed conflict\u2019 remains outside the brackets; hence this issue will continue to raise controversies in the future.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 145)", "\u201cThe first set of problems concerns the legal qualification of cyber operations under lex lata. Potentially, interstate cyber operations can breach a number of primary rules, including the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the principle of non-interference in domestic affairs, international human rights law, the prohibition against using force and, when such operations are conducted during an armed conflict, also norms of international humanitarian law. A legal obligation of \u2018cyber due diligence\u2019 \u2013 requiring states to ensure that \u2018their territory is not used as a base for state or non-state hostile cyber operations against another state that cause serious adverse consequences with regard to a right of the target state\u201952 \u2013 is still in a nascent form and, despite the positions of some states,53 is widely considered lex ferenda.54 The lex lata scope of obligations is constrained to the general duty of a state \u2018not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\u2019, as formulated by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Corfu Channel case55 and other positive obligations stemming from the no harm principle, international humanitarian law and international human rights law.56 In comparison with this \u2018patchwork\u2019 of existing duties,57 the application of the \u2018cyber due diligence\u2019 norm would have extended the scope of primary behaviour beyond the internationally wrongful acts to cover cyber operations with \u2018serious adverse consequences\u2019.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 144)", "\u201cThe third step of the analysis is an ex post estimation of the sanctions\u2019 impact and effects,241 the assessment of their factual consequences \u2013 intended or not. This evaluation often includes a cost-benefit analysis, but should not be limited to this. Although sanctions can have a calculable material impact, the assessment of their effectiveness should also include an analysis of effects other than economic costs, the first of which are the political consequences of sanctions.

Standards that may be relevant for setting the boundaries of outlawed cyber activities are constrained by the reference to lex lata international law and, as a general safeguard, these \u2018norms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law\u2019.138\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 154)", "\u201cThe current trend of \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 is characterised by two main features. First, public exposure of the organiser of a malicious cyber act is not linked to a breach of a particular rule of international law. Secondly, these acts are not accompanied by the disclosure of evidence that meets at least one of the standards that may be applicable under international law. For instance, whereas the UK National Cyber Security Centre relied on the assessment \u2018with high confidence\u2019 that the GRU was \u2018almost certainly responsible\u2019, which is \u201895%+\u2019 for a list of cyber operations,159 this evidence remained undisclosed.160 Thus, \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 reflected a \u2018name and shame\u2019 mode and did not represent attribution for the purposes of calling a particular state responsible.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 157)", "\u201cTurning to the applicability of jus in bello norms to cyber operations, can we truly celebrate that the states answer this question in the affirmative? To begin with, in almost all cases when the application of international humanitarian law is confirmed, we do not know in which source.

First, public exposure of the organiser of a malicious cyber act is not linked to a breach of a particular rule of international law. Secondly, these acts are not accompanied by the disclosure of evidence that meets at least one of the standards that may be applicable under international law. For instance, whereas the UK National Cyber Security Centre relied on the assessment \u2018with high confidence\u2019 that the GRU was \u2018almost certainly responsible\u2019, which is \u201895%+\u2019 for a list of cyber operations,159 this evidence remained undisclosed.160 Thus, \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 reflected a \u2018name and shame\u2019 mode and did not represent attribution for the purposes of calling a particular state responsible.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 157)", "\u201cAll three cyber-related sanction regimes have a number of common features. They are based on the use of targeted, or smart, sanctions as opposed to \u2018comprehensive\u2019 sanctions. The regimes contain rather vague and broad definitions of the cyber activities that trigger sanctions and of the criteria for designating persons on whom sanctions should be imposed. At the same time, the approach used in CAATSA \u2013 designating \u2018significant activities undermining cybersecurity against any person, including a democratic institution, or government\u2019 or are \u2018owned or controlled by, or act or purport to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly\u2019 by such person189 \u2013 is wider than the European approach. EU Regulation 2019/796 confines \u2018cyber-attacks\u2019 to those that \u2018have (or potentially may have) a significant effect on the EU or its member states, in particular to their critical infrastructure, public services (transportation, banking, healthcare, drinking water supply and others), critical state functions such as defence and governance\u2019.190 The understanding of cyber-enabled actions is very close in EU Regulation 2019/796 and the UK Cyber Regulations 2020 (access to information systems, interference with information systems, data interference, and data interception).191 However, the EU regulation qualifies such actions as cyber attacks if they originate or are carried out from outside the EU and harm the EU or its member states,192 while the UK regulations adopt a broader approach: cyber activities are considered a cyber attack if they have consequences not only in the UK but also in any other country, or affect \u2018a significant number of persons in an indiscriminate manner\u2019.193 Contrary to the US and the EU regimes, the UK Cyber Regulations 2020 do not respond explicitly to external threats and do not focus on the condition that the malicious activities should be conducted or controlled from outside the country.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 161)", "\u201cTurning to the applicability of jus in bello norms to cyber operations, can we truly celebrate that the states answer this question in the affirmative? To begin with, in almost all cases when the application of international humanitarian law is confirmed, we do not know in which source. For instance, 79 states have supported the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyber Space, which states laconically that international humanitarian law \u2018is applicable to the use of information and communication technologies by States\u2019.97 A more or less detailed position has been represented by only a few states, which so far include Australia,98 Germany,99 the Netherlands,100 the UK,101 the US,102 France,103 Finland,104 and Israel.105\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 149)", "\u201cCyber incidents have become daily events; moreover, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 triggered a significant growth in malicious cyber operations. For instance, the FBI reported about a 300 per cent increase in cyber security complaints just in the wake of the pandemic.1 Only some of the cyber operations taking place around the world are suspected of being statesponsored. In 2020 about 88 allegedly interstate operations, mostly espionage, were reported.2 According to the Council of Foreign Relations, which has tracked significant cyber operations since 2005, 36 states are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations; in this list China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are designated as responsible for 77 per cent of all cyber operations of this type.3\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 136)", "\u201cThe Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs articulated that \u2018it cannot be ruled out that a cyber operation with a very serious financial or economic impact may qualify as the use of force\u2019.95 Finally, the UK Cyber Primer, although acknowledging the necessity for a cyber operation to cause \u2018the same or similar effects as a kinetic attack\u2019, in a footnote included a clarification permitting such a qualification for attacks, like \u2018a sustained attack against the UK banking system, which could cause severe financial damage to the state, leading to a worsening economic security situation for the population\u2019.96\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 149)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5F79G29F%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22156%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B68.7118%2C350.129775%2C379.8259111099999%2C360.12987499999997%5D%2C%5B56.69267980999996%2C338.68066050999994%2C379.8049108999997%2C347.27074640999996%5D%2C%5B56.69267980999996%2C327.1715454199999%2C379.82191106999994%2C335.76163131999994%5D%2C%5B56.69267980999996%2C315.6624303299999%2C379.8289111399998%2C324.2525162299999%5D%2C%5B56.69267980999996%2C304.15331523999987%2C379.84591130999985%2C312.7434011399999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQIP2P6JZ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22156%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe current trend of \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 is characterised by two main features.

The same divergence was found in the positions of states expressed at the OEWG meetings in 2019 and 2020.66 While the majority of states confirmed the applicability of international law in its entirety to cyberspace,67 it was contested by a group of states that used arguments related to the importance of state consent for the extension of the scope of non-cyber-specific norms, indeterminate thresholds of \u2018armed attack\u2019 by cyber means, and the doubtful applicability of international humanitarian law to hybrid warfare and to civilian perpetrators of cyber attacks.68 Some states took an intermediate position by appealing to the need to adopt new legally binding instruments.69 In its report of 2021 the GGE finally acknowledged the applicability of international humanitarian law, but highlighted that these norms apply \u2018only in situations of armed conflict\u2019.70 This acknowledgement is ambivalent, as the question of whether a particular operation with the use of ICTs can be qualified as \u2018an armed conflict\u2019 remains outside the brackets; hence this issue will continue to raise controversies in the future.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 145)", "\u201cCyber incidents have become daily events; moreover, the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 triggered a significant growth in malicious cyber operations. For instance, the FBI reported about a 300 per cent increase in cyber security complaints just in the wake of the pandemic.1 Only some of the cyber operations taking place around the world are suspected of being statesponsored. In 2020 about 88 allegedly interstate operations, mostly espionage, were reported.2 According to the Council of Foreign Relations, which has tracked significant cyber operations since 2005, 36 states are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations; in this list China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are designated as responsible for 77 per cent of all cyber operations of this type.3\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 136)", "\u201cThe current trend of \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 is characterised by two main features. First, public exposure of the organiser of a malicious cyber act is not linked to a breach of a particular rule of international law. Secondly, these acts are not accompanied by the disclosure of evidence that meets at least one of the standards that may be applicable under international law. For instance, whereas the UK National Cyber Security Centre relied on the assessment \u2018with high confidence\u2019 that the GRU was \u2018almost certainly responsible\u2019, which is \u201895%+\u2019 for a list of cyber operations,159 this evidence remained undisclosed.160 Thus, \u2018cautious attribution\u2019 reflected a \u2018name and shame\u2019 mode and did not represent attribution for the purposes of calling a particular state responsible.\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 157)", "\u201cThe Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs articulated that \u2018it cannot be ruled out that a cyber operation with a very serious financial or economic impact may qualify as the use of force\u2019.95 Finally, the UK Cyber Primer, although acknowledging the necessity for a cyber operation to cause \u2018the same or similar effects as a kinetic attack\u2019, in a footnote included a clarification permitting such a qualification for attacks, like \u2018a sustained attack against the UK banking system, which could cause severe financial damage to the state, leading to a worsening economic security situation for the population\u2019.96\u201d (Rusinova e Martynova, 2024, p. 149)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F5F79G29F%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22149%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A14%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B63.0425%2C453.6543756%2C374.16661120999987%2C462.2444615%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C442.14526050999996%2C374.1586111299999%2C450.73534641%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C430.69314598999995%2C374.1576111199999%2C439.28323188999997%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C419.1840308999999%2C374.14061095%2C427.77411679999994%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C407.6749158099999%2C374.11461069000006%2C416.2650017099999%5D%2C%5B51.02337981000002%2C396.1058001199999%2C374.1606111499998%2C406.1059001199999%5D%2C%5B51.023379809999966%2C384.5966850299999%2C374.16674157%2C395.67749%5D%2C%5B51.022510160000024%2C373.14996050999997%2C374.13374123999984%2C381.74004641%5D%2C%5B51.022510160000024%2C361.69784598999996%2C374.15805959999994%2C372.66008999999997%5D%2C%5B51.0236%2C350.18977559999996%2C194.72505960000004%2C361.15139%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FQIP2P6JZ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22149%22%7D%7D\">\u201cTurning to the applicability of jus in bello norms to cyber operations, can we truly celebrate that the states answer this question in the affirmative?
