Analysis begins with a discussion of the international rules most likely to be violated by either a proxy\u2019s hostile cyber operation or the proposed cyber response by the victim state. Those response options will also be determined by whether the proxy\u2019s operation can be attributed to a state as a matter of law, the subsequent topic addressed below. Such legal attribution must not be confused with technical attribution, which denotes evidence of the relationship, and from political attribution, which simply refers to a policy decision to blame another state. The foundation laid, the discussion will proceed serially through the various categories of responses existing in international law, zeroing in on the legal preconditions that must exist before engaging in them against a proxy group or the affiliated state.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 17)", "\u201cThe most likely obligation to be breached by a cyber operation is respect for another state\u2019s sovereignty. There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201c1.

Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2216%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B225.06%2C305.1981%2C459.0001%2C315.4501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C290.9451%2C459%2C301.4501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C276.9451%2C459%2C287.4391%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C262.9451%2C458.99609999999996%2C273.4391%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C248.9451%2C458.9820999999992%2C260.048884%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C235.1981%2C458.96199999999953%2C245.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C221.1981%2C458.99169999999947%2C231.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C207.1981%2C459.02799999999917%2C217.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C193.1981%2C458.99279999999914%2C203.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C179.1981%2C458.98179999999917%2C189.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C165.1981%2C458.98289999999946%2C175.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C151.1981%2C459.00599999999923%2C161.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C137.1981%2C459.00709999999947%2C147.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C123.1981%2C459.02799999999934%2C133.4501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C109.1981%2C458.97189999999944%2C119.45009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis article addresses an issue appearing in the Army\u2019s 2021\u201322 Key Strategic Issues List: \u201cAssess Russia\u2019s use of proxy or patriotic hackers and evaluate international laws and norms that can be used to limit their use.\u201d[8] As will be illustrated, it is generally the interplay between the type of harm caused by a hostile cyber operation, the legal attributability of the operation to a state, and the legal nature of the proposed response that determines how the victim state may respond.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.64%2C114.1981%2C458.6402%2C124.45009999999999%5D%2C%5B44.64%2C100.1981%2C458.6656999999993%2C110.45009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable.

A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B225.06%2C123.6981%2C459.038799999999%2C133.9501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C109.6981%2C458.9938999999992%2C119.95009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate.</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C635.9450999999999%2C459.0044999999994%2C646.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C622.1981%2C459.01019999999914%2C633.048984%5D%2C%5B45%2C608.1981%2C458.9618999999993%2C618.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C594.1981%2C458.983899999999%2C604.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C580.1981%2C458.9728999999994%2C590.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C566.1981%2C90.70563200000001%2C577.048984%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space.

Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Durward E.

In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice suggested that a proxy\u2019s acts are attributable when the state directs or controls specific operations; the Court labeled this \u201ceffective control.\u201d General support or encouragement of cyber proxy operations is not enough.[29] The Court even held that a state\u2019s participation in the \u201cfinancing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\u201d of a proxy organization and the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation\u201d did not reach the \u201ceffective control\u201d threshold.[30] Such involvement in the cyber operations would likely amount to unlawful intervention into the internal affairs of the target state, but the proxy\u2019s actions themselves would not be attributable to the state concerned.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)", "\u201cStates agree that cyber operations that cause significant physical damage, destruction, death, or injury are armed attacks.[68] Whether those causing a lesser degree of damage or injury, or non-destructive or injurious harm, may be characterized as armed attacks remains an open debate, but France has gone as far as indicating that a non-destructive cyber operation against its national economy might even qualify.[69] States that have spoken on the issue increasingly agree with the International Court of Justice that whether a non-destructive cyber operation is a use of force at the armed attack depends on its \u201cscale and effects.\u201d[70] Precisely where the threshold lies, however, remains unresolved.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 29)", "\u201cOther lawful means of responding to proxy cyber operations are available. For instance, the United States is increasingly resorting to judicial action by indicting members of proxy groups for domestic criminal offenses, as in the case of the Yahoo data breach mentioned above[43] and a 2019 criminal indictment of two members of Evil Corp, a Russian-based cybercriminal organization accused of supporting the Russian government\u2019s hostile cyber efforts.[44] The targeted state can also seek a UN Charter, Chapter VII, Security Council resolution condemning proxy operations and authorizing interference, disruption, or even destruction of a proxy\u2019s cyber capabilities, as well as sanctions or other action against a state supporting the group.[45] Of course, doing so in the case of Russia or China would be impossible in light of their veto power as one of the permanent five (P5) members of the Security Council. Judicial action in the International Court of Justice against a state to which a proxy\u2019s operations are attributable is a theoretical possibility, although highly unlikely because of the jurisdictional hurdles of bringing another state before that court.[46]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23)", "\u201c1.

For instance, the United States is increasingly resorting to judicial action by indicting members of proxy groups for domestic criminal offenses, as in the case of the Yahoo data breach mentioned above[43] and a 2019 criminal indictment of two members of Evil Corp, a Russian-based cybercriminal organization accused of supporting the Russian government\u2019s hostile cyber efforts.[44] The targeted state can also seek a UN Charter, Chapter VII, Security Council resolution condemning proxy operations and authorizing interference, disruption, or even destruction of a proxy\u2019s cyber capabilities, as well as sanctions or other action against a state supporting the group.[45] Of course, doing so in the case of Russia or China would be impossible in light of their veto power as one of the permanent five (P5) members of the Security Council. Judicial action in the International Court of Justice against a state to which a proxy\u2019s operations are attributable is a theoretical possibility, although highly unlikely because of the jurisdictional hurdles of bringing another state before that court.[46]\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C620.8841%2C455.80930000000006%2C628.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C610.8841%2C447.0080000000005%2C618.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C600.8841%2C278.1511999999998%2C608.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C589.0841%2C442.20720000000057%2C597.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C579.0841%2C442.6720000000002%2C587.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C569.0841%2C447.7360000000004%2C577.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C559.0841%2C455.0815%2C567.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C549.0841%2C80.23200000000001%2C557.0601%5D%2C%5B45%2C537.2842%2C441.7889999999991%2C545.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C527.2842%2C447.2412%2C535.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C517.2842%2C311.4871999999998%2C525.2602%5D%2C%5B45%2C505.4841%2C455.4027000000005%2C513.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C495.4841%2C225.08799999999974%2C503.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C483.6841%2C446.469099999999%2C491.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C473.6841%2C448.8091%2C481.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C463.6841%2C302.3679999999998%2C471.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C451.88410000000005%2C447.3729999999989%2C459.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C441.88410000000005%2C451.98150000000044%2C449.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C431.88410000000005%2C289.79999999999984%2C439.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C420.08410000000003%2C457.43570000000057%2C428.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C410.08410000000003%2C255.62399999999963%2C418.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C398.2841%2C455.58810000000096%2C406.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C388.2841%2C230.82399999999964%2C396.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C376.4841%2C456.04460000000097%2C384.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C366.4841%2C440.1036000000006%2C374.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C356.4841%2C446.5457000000001%2C364.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C346.4841%2C441.88260000000025%2C354.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C336.4841%2C440.8860000000006%2C344.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C324.6841%2C450.4342000000003%2C332.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C314.6841%2C172.83119999999985%2C322.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C302.88410000000005%2C187.0959999999999%2C310.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C291.08410000000003%2C450.873%2C299.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C281.08410000000003%2C417.55040000000054%2C289.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C269.2841%2C453.4905000000003%2C277.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C259.2841%2C458.9774%2C267.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C249.2841%2C173.47199999999987%2C257.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C237.48409999999998%2C432.4903%2C245.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C227.48409999999998%2C434.6973%2C235.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C217.48409999999998%2C133.38400000000001%2C225.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B45%2C205.6841%2C114.46400000000004%2C213.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C193.8841%2C448.16270000000037%2C201.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C183.8841%2C441.202%2C191.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C173.8841%2C443.32200000000006%2C181.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C163.8841%2C439.9216%2C171.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C153.8841%2C443.5720999999993%2C161.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C143.8841%2C455.4633000000006%2C151.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C133.8841%2C449.89600000000064%2C141.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C123.88409999999999%2C155.88799999999998%2C131.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C112.08409999999999%2C451.2064000000007%2C120.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C102.08409999999999%2C439.6567%2C110.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C92.08409999999999%2C383.96000000000026%2C100.06009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2231%22%7D%7D\">\u201c1.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201c1.

To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations.[24] In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state.[25] Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to \u201cexercise elements of governmental authority.\u201d[26] The activities must be quintessentially governmental. An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state\u2019s adversary.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C431.1981%2C459.01999999999924%2C441.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C417.1981%2C459.04549999999927%2C427.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C403.1981%2C459.0002319999999%2C414.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C389.1981%2C458.96079999999944%2C399.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C375.1981%2C459.0002%2C385.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C361.1981%2C459.00039999999944%2C371.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C347.1981%2C459.028999999999%2C357.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C333.1981%2C458.9943999999999%2C344.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C319.1981%2C459.0002%2C329.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C305.1981%2C197.51413199999996%2C316.048884%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe most likely obligation to be breached by a cyber operation is respect for another state\u2019s sovereignty. There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.64%2C114.1981%2C458.6402%2C124.45009999999999%5D%2C%5B44.64%2C100.1981%2C458.6656999999993%2C110.45009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable.

A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B225.06%2C123.6981%2C459.038799999999%2C133.9501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C109.6981%2C458.9938999999992%2C119.95009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate.</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C635.9450999999999%2C459.0044999999994%2C646.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C622.1981%2C459.01019999999914%2C633.048984%5D%2C%5B45%2C608.1981%2C458.9618999999993%2C618.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C594.1981%2C458.983899999999%2C604.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C580.1981%2C458.9728999999994%2C590.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C566.1981%2C90.70563200000001%2C577.048984%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space.

Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C620.8841%2C455.80930000000006%2C628.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C610.8841%2C447.0080000000005%2C618.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C600.8841%2C278.1511999999998%2C608.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C589.0841%2C442.20720000000057%2C597.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C579.0841%2C442.6720000000002%2C587.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C569.0841%2C447.7360000000004%2C577.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C559.0841%2C455.0815%2C567.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C549.0841%2C80.23200000000001%2C557.0601%5D%2C%5B45%2C537.2842%2C441.7889999999991%2C545.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C527.2842%2C447.2412%2C535.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C517.2842%2C311.4871999999998%2C525.2602%5D%2C%5B45%2C505.4841%2C455.4027000000005%2C513.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C495.4841%2C225.08799999999974%2C503.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C483.6841%2C446.469099999999%2C491.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C473.6841%2C448.8091%2C481.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C463.6841%2C302.3679999999998%2C471.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C451.88410000000005%2C447.3729999999989%2C459.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C441.88410000000005%2C451.98150000000044%2C449.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C431.88410000000005%2C289.79999999999984%2C439.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C420.08410000000003%2C457.43570000000057%2C428.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C410.08410000000003%2C255.62399999999963%2C418.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C398.2841%2C455.58810000000096%2C406.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C388.2841%2C230.82399999999964%2C396.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C376.4841%2C456.04460000000097%2C384.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C366.4841%2C440.1036000000006%2C374.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C356.4841%2C446.5457000000001%2C364.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C346.4841%2C441.88260000000025%2C354.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C336.4841%2C440.8860000000006%2C344.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C324.6841%2C450.4342000000003%2C332.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C314.6841%2C172.83119999999985%2C322.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C302.88410000000005%2C187.0959999999999%2C310.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C291.08410000000003%2C450.873%2C299.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C281.08410000000003%2C417.55040000000054%2C289.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C269.2841%2C453.4905000000003%2C277.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C259.2841%2C458.9774%2C267.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C249.2841%2C173.47199999999987%2C257.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C237.48409999999998%2C432.4903%2C245.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C227.48409999999998%2C434.6973%2C235.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C217.48409999999998%2C133.38400000000001%2C225.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B45%2C205.6841%2C114.46400000000004%2C213.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C193.8841%2C448.16270000000037%2C201.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C183.8841%2C441.202%2C191.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C173.8841%2C443.32200000000006%2C181.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C163.8841%2C439.9216%2C171.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C153.8841%2C443.5720999999993%2C161.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C143.8841%2C455.4633000000006%2C151.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C133.8841%2C449.89600000000064%2C141.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C123.88409999999999%2C155.88799999999998%2C131.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C112.08409999999999%2C451.2064000000007%2C120.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C102.08409999999999%2C439.6567%2C110.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C92.08409999999999%2C383.96000000000026%2C100.06009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2231%22%7D%7D\">\u201c1.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state. To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations.[24] In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state.[25] Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to \u201cexercise elements of governmental authority.\u201d[26] The activities must be quintessentially governmental. An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state\u2019s adversary.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)", "\u201c1.

Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.64%2C114.1981%2C458.6402%2C124.45009999999999%5D%2C%5B44.64%2C100.1981%2C458.6656999999993%2C110.45009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable.

A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B225.06%2C123.6981%2C459.038799999999%2C133.9501%5D%2C%5B216.06%2C109.6981%2C458.9938999999992%2C119.95009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate.</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C635.9450999999999%2C459.0044999999994%2C646.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C622.1981%2C459.01019999999914%2C633.048984%5D%2C%5B45%2C608.1981%2C458.9618999999993%2C618.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C594.1981%2C458.983899999999%2C604.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C580.1981%2C458.9728999999994%2C590.4500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C566.1981%2C90.70563200000001%2C577.048984%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state. To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations.[24] In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state.[25] Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to \u201cexercise elements of governmental authority.\u201d[26] The activities must be quintessentially governmental. An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state\u2019s adversary.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber responses that do not cause effects that would violate international law also qualify as acts of retorsion. For instance, a state targeted by a proxy\u2019s cyber operations may undertake cyber information (and even disinformation) campaigns,[39] cyber espionage, and other intelligence and counterintelligence cyber operations against both a proxy or a state with some relationship to the hostile operations, so long as the cyber responses do not cross any legal threshold, such as those described above, that would render them unlawful.[40] Or a targeted state could establish access within hostile cyberinfrastructure without causing internationally wrongful effects to signal its capability and willingness to respond to future hostile cyber operations.[41] The victim state could even block access by proxy groups, individuals, and specified states to its cyberinfrastructure as an act of retorsion, for there is no international law right of access to cyberinfrastructure on another state\u2019s territory.[42]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C431.1981%2C459.01999999999924%2C441.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C417.1981%2C459.04549999999927%2C427.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C403.1981%2C459.0002319999999%2C414.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C389.1981%2C458.96079999999944%2C399.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C375.1981%2C459.0002%2C385.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C361.1981%2C459.00039999999944%2C371.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C347.1981%2C459.028999999999%2C357.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C333.1981%2C458.9943999999999%2C344.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C319.1981%2C459.0002%2C329.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C305.1981%2C197.51413199999996%2C316.048884%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe most likely obligation to be breached by a cyber operation is respect for another state\u2019s sovereignty.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state. To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations.[24] In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state.[25] Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to \u201cexercise elements of governmental authority.\u201d[26] The activities must be quintessentially governmental. An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state\u2019s adversary.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber responses that do not cause effects that would violate international law also qualify as acts of retorsion. For instance, a state targeted by a proxy\u2019s cyber operations may undertake cyber information (and even disinformation) campaigns,[39] cyber espionage, and other intelligence and counterintelligence cyber operations against both a proxy or a state with some relationship to the hostile operations, so long as the cyber responses do not cross any legal threshold, such as those described above, that would render them unlawful.[40] Or a targeted state could establish access within hostile cyberinfrastructure without causing internationally wrongful effects to signal its capability and willingness to respond to future hostile cyber operations.[41] The victim state could even block access by proxy groups, individuals, and specified states to its cyberinfrastructure as an act of retorsion, for there is no international law right of access to cyberinfrastructure on another state\u2019s territory.[42]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201c1.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A13%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.64%2C114.1981%2C458.6402%2C124.45009999999999%5D%2C%5B44.64%2C100.1981%2C458.6656999999993%2C110.45009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable.

A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54.36%2C198.1981%2C458.9927999999991%2C208.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C183.9451%2C459.0002%2C194.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C170.1981%2C459.0699999999991%2C180.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C156.1981%2C459.01279999999906%2C166.45010000000002%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C142.1981%2C458.9957999999995%2C153.048884%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C128.1981%2C459.04389999999927%2C139.048884%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C114.1981%2C459.0001%2C124.45009999999999%5D%2C%5B45.36%2C100.1981%2C459.012999999999%2C111.048984%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state.

Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2231%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B45%2C620.8841%2C455.80930000000006%2C628.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C610.8841%2C447.0080000000005%2C618.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C600.8841%2C278.1511999999998%2C608.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C589.0841%2C442.20720000000057%2C597.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C579.0841%2C442.6720000000002%2C587.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C569.0841%2C447.7360000000004%2C577.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C559.0841%2C455.0815%2C567.0601%5D%2C%5B58%2C549.0841%2C80.23200000000001%2C557.0601%5D%2C%5B45%2C537.2842%2C441.7889999999991%2C545.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C527.2842%2C447.2412%2C535.2602%5D%2C%5B58%2C517.2842%2C311.4871999999998%2C525.2602%5D%2C%5B45%2C505.4841%2C455.4027000000005%2C513.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C495.4841%2C225.08799999999974%2C503.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C483.6841%2C446.469099999999%2C491.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C473.6841%2C448.8091%2C481.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C463.6841%2C302.3679999999998%2C471.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C451.88410000000005%2C447.3729999999989%2C459.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C441.88410000000005%2C451.98150000000044%2C449.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B58%2C431.88410000000005%2C289.79999999999984%2C439.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C420.08410000000003%2C457.43570000000057%2C428.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C410.08410000000003%2C255.62399999999963%2C418.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C398.2841%2C455.58810000000096%2C406.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C388.2841%2C230.82399999999964%2C396.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C376.4841%2C456.04460000000097%2C384.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C366.4841%2C440.1036000000006%2C374.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C356.4841%2C446.5457000000001%2C364.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C346.4841%2C441.88260000000025%2C354.4601%5D%2C%5B58%2C336.4841%2C440.8860000000006%2C344.4601%5D%2C%5B45%2C324.6841%2C450.4342000000003%2C332.6601%5D%2C%5B58%2C314.6841%2C172.83119999999985%2C322.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C302.88410000000005%2C187.0959999999999%2C310.86010000000005%5D%2C%5B45%2C291.08410000000003%2C450.873%2C299.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B58%2C281.08410000000003%2C417.55040000000054%2C289.06010000000003%5D%2C%5B45%2C269.2841%2C453.4905000000003%2C277.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C259.2841%2C458.9774%2C267.2601%5D%2C%5B58%2C249.2841%2C173.47199999999987%2C257.2601%5D%2C%5B45%2C237.48409999999998%2C432.4903%2C245.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C227.48409999999998%2C434.6973%2C235.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B58%2C217.48409999999998%2C133.38400000000001%2C225.46009999999998%5D%2C%5B45%2C205.6841%2C114.46400000000004%2C213.6601%5D%2C%5B45%2C193.8841%2C448.16270000000037%2C201.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C183.8841%2C441.202%2C191.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C173.8841%2C443.32200000000006%2C181.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C163.8841%2C439.9216%2C171.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C153.8841%2C443.5720999999993%2C161.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C143.8841%2C455.4633000000006%2C151.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C133.8841%2C449.89600000000064%2C141.8601%5D%2C%5B58%2C123.88409999999999%2C155.88799999999998%2C131.8601%5D%2C%5B45%2C112.08409999999999%2C451.2064000000007%2C120.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C102.08409999999999%2C439.6567%2C110.06009999999999%5D%2C%5B58%2C92.08409999999999%2C383.96000000000026%2C100.06009999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2231%22%7D%7D\">\u201c1.

When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state. To begin with, individuals, groups, or other entities are considered de facto organs for purposes of legal attribution if they are completely dependent on the state, as when an intelligence agency creates an unofficial group for the express purpose of conducting hostile cyber operations, funds (perhaps secretly) the group, and determines its operations.[24] In these cases, a proxy is essentially an instrument of the state.[25] Cyber operations are also attributable to a state where individuals, groups, or entities are legally empowered by the state to \u201cexercise elements of governmental authority.\u201d[26] The activities must be quintessentially governmental. An example would be contracting with a private company to perform non-commercial cyber espionage on behalf of the state or conduct offensive cyber operations against the state\u2019s adversary.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2218%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C431.1981%2C459.01999999999924%2C441.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C417.1981%2C459.04549999999927%2C427.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C403.1981%2C459.0002319999999%2C414.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C389.1981%2C458.96079999999944%2C399.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C375.1981%2C459.0002%2C385.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C361.1981%2C459.00039999999944%2C371.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C347.1981%2C459.028999999999%2C357.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C333.1981%2C458.9943999999999%2C344.048884%5D%2C%5B45%2C319.1981%2C459.0002%2C329.4501%5D%2C%5B45%2C305.1981%2C197.51413199999996%2C316.048884%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2218%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe most likely obligation to be breached by a cyber operation is respect for another state\u2019s sovereignty.

A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C519.6981%2C458.98369999999915%2C529.9500999999999%5D%2C%5B45%2C505.6981%2C459.0509999999993%2C515.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C491.4451%2C458.99619999999976%2C502.548884%5D%2C%5B45%2C477.6981%2C459.06859999999926%2C487.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C463.6981%2C459.0058999999992%2C473.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C449.6981%2C458.981699999999%2C459.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C435.6981%2C458.9827999999993%2C445.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C421.6981%2C459.0597999999992%2C431.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C407.6981%2C459.0002%2C417.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C393.6981%2C459.0267999999993%2C403.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C379.6981%2C459.0002319999999%2C390.548884%5D%2C%5B45%2C365.6981%2C127.96200000000003%2C375.9501%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cThere are scores of international law rules that hostile cyber operations, or responses to them, might violate. \u201cThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 project sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence identified many.[10] They range from violations of diplomatic or international human rights law to cyber operations that breach the obligations found in the law of the sea, air, or outer space. Excluding violations of the law of armed conflict, three loom large\u2014the obligation to respect the sovereignty of other states, the prohibition on coercive intervention, and the use of force.[11]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable. When proxies operate from a third state, the injured state may employ countermeasures directed at targets located in the responsible state\u2019s territory. A targeted state might, however, prefer to take action against the proxy\u2019s operations in the third state. The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures. Since countermeasures are otherwise unlawful actions, they would seem to be unlawful vis-\u00e0-vis the territorial state. The remedy to this situation can sometimes be found in the rule of due diligence.[59] States either disagree on the existence of such a rule or have not opined on its existence.[60] Nevertheless, the weight of opinion is that such a rule exists and is of particular relevance in the cyber context.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 26)", "\u201cUnlike sovereignty, the rule of non-intervention is uncontroversial, with all states accepting its application in the cyber context. Intervention has two elements. First, the cyber operation has to involve a state\u2019s internal or external affairs (the so-called domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9[19]). These are areas of activity that international law leaves to states to regulate, such as the state\u2019s political, economic, and social policies. Second, the hostile cyber operation in question must be coercive in the sense of depriving the victim state of choice by forcing it to (a) adopt a policy it would not otherwise adopt (b) refrain from adopting one it would otherwise adopt or (c) execute a policy in a manner that differs from that intended. Mere persuasion, influence, or diplomatic pressure is insufficient, as are propaganda and most other information operations, even when untruthful. Cyber operations motivated by other than a desire to address policy choice or execution, such as those that are purely criminal, as is often the case with North Korean operations,[20] also do not qualify.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 19)", "\u201cThere are multiple bases for attributing a proxy\u2019s cyber operations to a state.

For instance, a state targeted by a proxy\u2019s cyber operations may undertake cyber information (and even disinformation) campaigns,[39] cyber espionage, and other intelligence and counterintelligence cyber operations against both a proxy or a state with some relationship to the hostile operations, so long as the cyber responses do not cross any legal threshold, such as those described above, that would render them unlawful.[40] Or a targeted state could establish access within hostile cyberinfrastructure without causing internationally wrongful effects to signal its capability and willingness to respond to future hostile cyber operations.[41] The victim state could even block access by proxy groups, individuals, and specified states to its cyberinfrastructure as an act of retorsion, for there is no international law right of access to cyberinfrastructure on another state\u2019s territory.[42]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23)", "\u201cThe most likely obligation to be breached by a cyber operation is respect for another state\u2019s sovereignty.

Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty. NATO\u2019s Cyber Doctrine even reflects the rule.[13] The US position, however, remains ambiguous.[14] Yet when the United Kingdom issued a \u201creservation\u201d (a statement of disagreement) regarding NATO\u2019s acknowledgment of the rule, the US did not.[15]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 18)", "\u201cCyber proxies do not always operate from within the territory of the state to which their operations are attributable.

There has been some controversy regarding whether violation of sovereignty is even a rule of international law, with the United Kingdom suggesting in 2018 that it is not.[12] The United Kingdom argues that a state\u2019s remotely-conducted cyber operation into another state\u2019s territory does not violate its sovereignty, irrespective of the consequences of the operation; accordingly, neither would a proxy\u2019s operation. Since then, every state that has taken a firm stance on the matter accepts the existence of a rule of sovereignty.

The legal problem is that countermeasures may only be directed against a state that has breached a legal obligation owed to the state taking the countermeasures.

In its Nicaragua judgment, the International Court of Justice suggested that a proxy\u2019s acts are attributable when the state directs or controls specific operations; the Court labeled this \u201ceffective control.\u201d General support or encouragement of cyber proxy operations is not enough.[29] The Court even held that a state\u2019s participation in the \u201cfinancing, organizing, training, supplying, and equipping\u201d of a proxy organization and the selection of its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation\u201d did not reach the \u201ceffective control\u201d threshold.[30] Such involvement in the cyber operations would likely amount to unlawful intervention into the internal affairs of the target state, but the proxy\u2019s actions themselves would not be attributable to the state concerned.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 21)", "\u201cStates agree that cyber operations that cause significant physical damage, destruction, death, or injury are armed attacks.[68] Whether those causing a lesser degree of damage or injury, or non-destructive or injurious harm, may be characterized as armed attacks remains an open debate, but France has gone as far as indicating that a non-destructive cyber operation against its national economy might even qualify.[69] States that have spoken on the issue increasingly agree with the International Court of Justice that whether a non-destructive cyber operation is a use of force at the armed attack depends on its \u201cscale and effects.\u201d[70] Precisely where the threshold lies, however, remains unresolved.\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 29)", "\u201cOther lawful means of responding to proxy cyber operations are available. For instance, the United States is increasingly resorting to judicial action by indicting members of proxy groups for domestic criminal offenses, as in the case of the Yahoo data breach mentioned above[43] and a 2019 criminal indictment of two members of Evil Corp, a Russian-based cybercriminal organization accused of supporting the Russian government\u2019s hostile cyber efforts.[44] The targeted state can also seek a UN Charter, Chapter VII, Security Council resolution condemning proxy operations and authorizing interference, disruption, or even destruction of a proxy\u2019s cyber capabilities, as well as sanctions or other action against a state supporting the group.[45] Of course, doing so in the case of Russia or China would be impossible in light of their veto power as one of the permanent five (P5) members of the Security Council. Judicial action in the International Court of Justice against a state to which a proxy\u2019s operations are attributable is a theoretical possibility, although highly unlikely because of the jurisdictional hurdles of bringing another state before that court.[46]\u201d (Johnson e Schmitt, 2021, p. 23)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLHZRBA2H%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B54%2C398.6981%2C458.9649999999992%2C408.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C384.4451%2C459.01529999999974%2C394.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C370.6981%2C458.97069999999917%2C380.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C356.6981%2C459.0001%2C366.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C342.6981%2C459.0001%2C353.548884%5D%2C%5B45%2C328.6981%2C459.0036999999992%2C338.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C314.6981%2C458.9706999999989%2C324.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C300.6981%2C459.01609999999977%2C311.548884%5D%2C%5B45%2C286.6981%2C458.97179999999935%2C296.9501%5D%2C%5B45%2C272.6981%2C439.8614999999992%2C282.9501%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCBN4QWJQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe \u201cdirection or control\u201d standard applies when the proxy\u2019s affiliation with the state is looser than that of a proxy acting as an auxiliary.
