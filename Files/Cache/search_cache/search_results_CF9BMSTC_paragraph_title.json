For instance, the 2015 U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which included all permanent members of the Security Council and whose consensus report was endorsed by the General Assembly, noted that \u201caccusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.\u201d79 Still, the responsibility to release the evidence underlying attribution was styled as a voluntary, non-binding norm of responsible State behavior, not as a legal obligation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 213)", "\u201cA specific area of international relations in which fact-finding mechanisms have proven effective is arms control. Fact-finding in this field, especially with respect to the development, use, and proliferation of unconventional weapons, is especially relevant to cyber activity because States tend to operate behind a shroud of national security secrecy and investigations require sophisticated scientific expertise to collect and analyze data. Examples include the technical verification mechanisms developed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (through an Additional Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement),39 the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) (through the inspection activity of the Technical Secretariat),40 and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) (through the verification and monitoring activities of the Technical Secretariat).41\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 206)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVHGW7XB8%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22214%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A20%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C571.381796875%2C486.13599999999997%2C582.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C557.941796875%2C486.15999999999997%2C568.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C544.381796875%2C486.0820000000001%2C555.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C530.941796875%2C486.09400000000005%2C541.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C517.351796875%2C485.9839999999999%2C528.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C503.911796875%2C486.05600000000004%2C514.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C490.351796875%2C485.926%2C501.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C476.911796875%2C485.986%2C487.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C463.351796875%2C344.0142799999999%2C475.62184%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22214%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEvidentiary issues might also hamper regional mechanisms for cyberrelated sanctions.

In such fields, it can play an integral role in implementing the rule of law and developing and interpreting relevant international law norms.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 221</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVHGW7XB8%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22213%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A19%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C611.941796875%2C486.0620000000001%2C622.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C598.381796875%2C485.9839999999999%2C609.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C584.941796875%2C486.0139999999999%2C595.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C571.381796875%2C486.19000000000005%2C582.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C557.941796875%2C485.92400000000015%2C568.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C544.381796875%2C486.07400000000007%2C555.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C530.941796875%2C485.75600000000026%2C541.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C517.351796875%2C485.9420000000001%2C528.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C503.911796875%2C486.12427999999994%2C516.18184%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C490.351796875%2C485.94800000000015%2C501.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C476.911796875%2C486.082%2C487.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C463.351796875%2C228.09199999999998%2C474.358%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22213%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIt should be noted that attribution is seldom accompanied in practice by the release of the underlying evidence, despite broad international support for the principle that States should, where possible, provide the basis for that attribution.

promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies.

about those behind hostile cyber operations and giving effect to the rules of international law has been the driving force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years. In 2014, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC).87 The MCAAC would serve as an inter-State body entrusted with investigating cyber incidents with a view to attributing responsibility to States when appropriate. It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies. The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)", "\u201cScholars and practitioners have been laboring to address that uncertainty. Most significant in this regard have been the two Tallinn Manual projects sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence.3 However, both manuals avoided claims of certainty where reasonable differences of opinion existed as to the interpretation of a rule of law in the cyber context. Indeed, their major contribution may have been in pointing out where views diverged, thereby allowing States to focus interpretive efforts where they were most needed.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 197)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

international law has been the driving force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies. The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVHGW7XB8%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22200%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C611.941796875%2C486.12200000000007%2C622.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C598.381796875%2C485.97799999999995%2C609.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C584.941796875%2C486.004%2C597.2118399999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C571.381796875%2C485.9860000000001%2C583.65184%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C557.941796875%2C485.98600000000005%2C570.2118399999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C544.381796875%2C486.202%2C555.3879999999999%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C530.941796875%2C486.02200000000005%2C541.948%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C517.351796875%2C486.01%2C528.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C503.911796875%2C486.11800000000005%2C516.18184%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C490.351796875%2C486.10600000000005%2C501.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C476.911796875%2C486.14199999999994%2C487.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C463.351796875%2C486.028%2C475.62184%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C449.911796875%2C486.214%2C460.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C436.351796875%2C485.8820000000001%2C447.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C422.911796875%2C177.248%2C433.918%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22200%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe linkage between the need for factual information about those behind hostile cyber operations and giving effect to the rules of international law has been the driving force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22200%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVHGW7XB8%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C260.891796875%2C486.1300000000001%2C271.898%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C247.331796875%2C486.1420000000001%2C258.338%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C233.891796875%2C486.13000000000005%2C244.89800000000002%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C220.331796875%2C486.0620000000001%2C231.33800000000002%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C206.891796875%2C486.256%2C217.89800000000002%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C193.331796875%2C486.1300000000001%2C204.33800000000002%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C179.891796875%2C486.19000000000005%2C190.89800000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat.

force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years. In 2014, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC).87 The MCAAC would serve as an inter-State body entrusted with investigating cyber incidents with a view to attributing responsibility to States when appropriate. It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies. The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)", "\u201cOther States and international and regional organizations are also crafting collective responses to hostile cyber operations. In 2018, the United States announced an International Cyber Deterrence Initiative aimed at building a coalition of like-minded States that can act \u201cin concert\u201d to impose \u201cconsequences\u201d on adversaries, so as to ensure that they \u201cunderstand the consequences of their malicious cyber behavior.\u201d76 The 2018 U.S. National Cyber Strategy also envisions intelligence sharing with key partners to identify hostile State and non-State cyber activities.77 The same year, NATO leaders adopted the Brussels Summit Declaration, which confirmed that NATO\u2019s collective defense policies applied to cyberspace and called on its members to consider responding to malicious cyber activity in a coordinated manner.78\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 213)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

effect to the rules of international law has been the driving force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate \u201ccollective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks\u201d in order to \u201cclose the accountability gap.\u201d17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)", "\u201cWe believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW\u2019s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State\u2019s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)", "\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years. In 2014, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC).87 The MCAAC would serve as an inter-State body entrusted with investigating cyber incidents with a view to attributing responsibility to States when appropriate. It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies. The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)", "\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.

The Atlantic Council\u2019s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22215%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVHGW7XB8%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22215%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C409.352%2C486.242%2C422.852%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C394.952%2C486.1%2C408.973%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C381.512%2C486.202%2C395.012%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C367.952%2C486.064%2C381.668%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C354.512%2C485.954%2C368.012%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C340.932%2C486.07%2C354.432%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C327.492%2C486.208%2C340.992%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C313.932%2C486.172%2C327.432%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C300.492%2C486.13%2C313.992%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C286.932%2C486.094%2C300.432%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C273.492%2C380.858%2C286.992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FCF9BMSTC%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22215%22%7D%7D\">\u201cSeveral initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years.
