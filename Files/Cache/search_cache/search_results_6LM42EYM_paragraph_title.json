The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cFinally, the effective-control test and the varying burdens of proof standards provide few parallels to cyber activities since the underlying actions addressed by the ICJ involved obvious uses of force and were conducted by military or paramilitary groups that were executing kinetic operations in a geographic space.84 Cyber activities generally do not rise to a level considered a use of force, are typically conducted by clandestine operators, and the actions occur in the digital ether of ones and zeros. Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law. Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 67)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential. As Harold Koh, former legal advisor for the Department of State, aptly stated, questions of attribution \u201care as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones.\u201d86\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cAs demonstrated in Table 1,23 over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States. As stated in the United States Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, \u201crevisionist powers . . . are competing across all dimensions of power. They have increased efforts short of armed conflict by expanding coercion to new fronts, violating principles of sovereignty [and] exploiting ambiguity.\u201d24 Cyber proxies have become a valuable resource for the Russian government because they can accomplish political objectives economically while providing Russia plausible deniability from attribution.25 Finally, Russia recognizes its relative economic, political, and military shortcomings compared to the United States and utilizes cyber proxies to asymmetrically offset its weaknesses and challenge the United States.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 62)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2263%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B404.0038799999999%2C225.09976937500005%2C559.22388%2C235.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C213.09976937500005%2C564.0538800000002%2C223.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C201.09976937500005%2C568.2441046%2C211.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C189.09976937500005%2C564.0938799999999%2C199.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C177.09976937500005%2C571.56388%2C187.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C165.09976937500005%2C568.3743390000001%2C175.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C153.09976937500005%2C561.97388%2C163.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C141.09976937500005%2C574.6641338999997%2C151.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C129.09976937500005%2C565.1538800000001%2C139.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B404.0038799999999%2C117.09976937500005%2C554.5261599999999%2C127.66193000000004%5D%2C%5B403.9961599999999%2C105.09976937500005%2C568.9161599999999%2C115.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B403.9961599999999%2C93.09976937500005%2C562.88616%2C103.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B403.9961599999999%2C81.09976937500005%2C564.88616%2C91.43016000000006%5D%2C%5B403.9961599999999%2C69.09976937500005%2C566.6563161999999%2C79.43016000000006%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2263%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations].

Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential. As Harold Koh, former legal advisor for the Department of State, aptly stated, questions of attribution \u201care as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones.\u201d86\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law. Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means.

Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2267%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Anderson, 2021, p. 67</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2262%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B422.00018999999975%2C681.099629375%2C557.4469899999998%2C691.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C669.099629375%2C563.5969899999999%2C679.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C657.099629375%2C568.1569899999997%2C667.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C645.099629375%2C566.6269899999996%2C655.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C633.099629375%2C567.37699%2C643.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C621.099629375%2C566.91699%2C631.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C609.099629375%2C554.2069899999997%2C619.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C597.099629375%2C572.1470290999998%2C607.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C585.099629375%2C573.1169900000002%2C595.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C573.099629375%2C570.1669118999998%2C583.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C561.099629375%2C565.7869900000001%2C571.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C549.099629375%2C567.0035099999999%2C559.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C537.099629375%2C565.7600778899999%2C547.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C525.099629375%2C573.1999899999998%2C535.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C513.099629375%2C556.66999%2C523.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C501.09962937499995%2C575.9999899999998%2C511.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C489.09962937499995%2C564.4997899999998%2C499.66178999999994%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C477.09962937499995%2C557.9597899999999%2C487.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C465.09962937499995%2C565.3697606999997%2C475.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C453.09962937499995%2C574.92979%2C463.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C441.09962937499995%2C565.3598974%2C451.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C429.09962937499995%2C554.7797899999999%2C439.43001999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2262%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs demonstrated in Table 1,23 over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential. As Harold Koh, former legal advisor for the Department of State, aptly stated, questions of attribution \u201care as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones.\u201d86\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law.

Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2267%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Anderson, 2021, p. 67</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2262%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B422.00018999999975%2C681.099629375%2C557.4469899999998%2C691.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C669.099629375%2C563.5969899999999%2C679.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C657.099629375%2C568.1569899999997%2C667.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C645.099629375%2C566.6269899999996%2C655.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C633.099629375%2C567.37699%2C643.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C621.099629375%2C566.91699%2C631.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C609.099629375%2C554.2069899999997%2C619.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C597.099629375%2C572.1470290999998%2C607.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C585.099629375%2C573.1169900000002%2C595.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C573.099629375%2C570.1669118999998%2C583.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C561.099629375%2C565.7869900000001%2C571.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C549.099629375%2C567.0035099999999%2C559.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C537.099629375%2C565.7600778899999%2C547.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C525.099629375%2C573.1999899999998%2C535.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C513.099629375%2C556.66999%2C523.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C501.09962937499995%2C575.9999899999998%2C511.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C489.09962937499995%2C564.4997899999998%2C499.66178999999994%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C477.09962937499995%2C557.9597899999999%2C487.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C465.09962937499995%2C565.3697606999997%2C475.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C453.09962937499995%2C574.92979%2C463.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C441.09962937499995%2C565.3598974%2C451.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C429.09962937499995%2C554.7797899999999%2C439.43001999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2262%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs demonstrated in Table 1,23 over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law. Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 67)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential. As Harold Koh, former legal advisor for the Department of State, aptly stated, questions of attribution \u201care as much questions of a technical and policy nature rather than exclusively or even predominantly questions of law. Cyberspace remains a new and dynamic operating environment, and we cannot expect that all answers to the new and confounding questions we face will be legal ones.\u201d86\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cAs demonstrated in Table 1,23 over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States. As stated in the United States Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, \u201crevisionist powers . . . are competing across all dimensions of power. They have increased efforts short of armed conflict by expanding coercion to new fronts, violating principles of sovereignty [and] exploiting ambiguity.\u201d24 Cyber proxies have become a valuable resource for the Russian government because they can accomplish political objectives economically while providing Russia plausible deniability from attribution.25 Finally, Russia recognizes its relative economic, political, and military shortcomings compared to the United States and utilizes cyber proxies to asymmetrically offset its weaknesses and challenge the United States.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 62)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2266%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B53.99554999999989%2C369.099709375%2C197.69554999999986%2C379.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C357.099709375%2C187.35554999999985%2C367.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C345.099709375%2C187.55554999999987%2C355.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C333.099709375%2C196.48554999999982%2C343.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C321.099709375%2C199.9055499999999%2C331.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C309.099709375%2C189.0355914999999%2C319.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C297.099709375%2C190.99554999999987%2C307.4301%5D%2C%5B35.99554999999989%2C285.099709375%2C195.9445499999999%2C295.66186999999996%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C273.099709375%2C189.3445499999998%2C283.4301%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C261.099709375%2C183.14454999999984%2C271.4301%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C249.09970937499997%2C191.97454999999985%2C259.4301%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C237.09970937499997%2C206.6545499999998%2C247.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C225.09970937499997%2C193.26454999999987%2C235.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C213.09970937499997%2C203.97454999999988%2C223.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C201.09970937499997%2C206.23454999999984%2C211.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C189.09970937499997%2C191.08454999999987%2C199.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C177.09970937499997%2C196.37454999999989%2C187.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C165.09970937499997%2C192.70454999999984%2C175.43009999999998%5D%2C%5B36.00454999999988%2C153.09970937499997%2C180.10454999999988%2C163.43009999999998%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2266%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, the effective-control test and the varying burdens of proof standards provide few parallels to cyber activities since the underlying actions addressed by the ICJ involved obvious uses of force and were conducted by military or paramilitary groups that were executing kinetic operations in a geographic space.84 Cyber activities generally do not rise to a level considered a use of force, are typically conducted by clandestine operators, and the actions occur in the digital ether of ones and zeros.

The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cFinally, the effective-control test and the varying burdens of proof standards provide few parallels to cyber activities since the underlying actions addressed by the ICJ involved obvious uses of force and were conducted by military or paramilitary groups that were executing kinetic operations in a geographic space.84 Cyber activities generally do not rise to a level considered a use of force, are typically conducted by clandestine operators, and the actions occur in the digital ether of ones and zeros. Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cRussia\u2019s attitude toward these cybercrime syndicates has developed into what Tim Maurer, Director of the Cyber Initiative for the Carnegie Endowment, describes as a \u201csanctioning regime\u201d for cyber proxies. Under a sanctioning regime, \u201ca state consciously, but indirectly, benefits from a malicious activity targeting a third party, an activity which the state could stop but chooses not to. Sanctioning describes environments where the state directly creates a fertile ground for such malicious activity to occur in the first place.\u201d55 In the case of Russia, cyber actors (which include cyber criminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored hacking teams) are continually operating from within its sphere of influence with the nascent understanding that, as long as they avoid attacking Russian assets or run counter to the interests of the Kremlin, most activities will be tolerated.56 As John Carlin, former Assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security, stated, \u201c[w]hat you\u2019re seeing is one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated intelligence operations when it comes to cyber espionage using the criminal groups for their intelligence ends and protecting them from law enforcement.\u201d57\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law. Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 67)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential.

Under a sanctioning regime, \u201ca state consciously, but indirectly, benefits from a malicious activity targeting a third party, an activity which the state could stop but chooses not to. Sanctioning describes environments where the state directly creates a fertile ground for such malicious activity to occur in the first place.\u201d55 In the case of Russia, cyber actors (which include cyber criminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored hacking teams) are continually operating from within its sphere of influence with the nascent understanding that, as long as they avoid attacking Russian assets or run counter to the interests of the Kremlin, most activities will be tolerated.56 As John Carlin, former Assistant U.S. Attorney General for National Security, stated, \u201c[w]hat you\u2019re seeing is one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated intelligence operations when it comes to cyber espionage using the criminal groups for their intelligence ends and protecting them from law enforcement.\u201d57\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2264%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Anderson, 2021, p. 64</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2267%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B220.00116999999997%2C369.09964937499996%2C390.79116999999997%2C379.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C357.09964937499996%2C385.9713653%2C367.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C345.09964937499996%2C383.75117%2C355.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C333.09964937499996%2C375.79116999999997%2C343.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C321.09964937499996%2C383.3611308999999%2C331.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C309.09964937499996%2C376.0711699999998%2C319.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C297.09964937499996%2C364.9411699999999%2C307.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C285.09964937499996%2C384.85116999999997%2C295.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C273.09964937499996%2C389.7411699999999%2C283.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C261.09964937499996%2C373.95116999999993%2C271.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C249.09964937499996%2C391.94116999999983%2C259.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C237.09964937499996%2C377.2011699999999%2C247.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C225.09964937499996%2C386.4711699999998%2C235.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C213.09964937499996%2C385.3511699999998%2C223.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C201.09964937499996%2C381.28117000000003%2C211.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C189.09964937499996%2C373.201004%2C199.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C177.09964937499996%2C384.34117000000003%2C187.43003999999996%5D%2C%5B220.00116999999997%2C165.09964937499996%2C320.37353999999993%2C175.66180999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2267%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law. Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cCurrent cyber threats posed by proxy actors against the United States operate in an underdeveloped section of international law.

The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cFinally, the effective-control test and the varying burdens of proof standards provide few parallels to cyber activities since the underlying actions addressed by the ICJ involved obvious uses of force and were conducted by military or paramilitary groups that were executing kinetic operations in a geographic space.84 Cyber activities generally do not rise to a level considered a use of force, are typically conducted by clandestine operators, and the actions occur in the digital ether of ones and zeros. Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 66)", "\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential.

Russian cyber proxy activities need to be addressed with a new policy and strategy-driven approach to rapidly identify aggressors in cyberspace and which also has inherent flexibility to counter actions against the interests of the United States that fall below the threshold of force.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2266%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Anderson, 2021, p. 66</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2266%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B220.0005499999999%2C657.1001093749999%2C378.730613479999%2C667.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C645.1001093749999%2C383.4305499999999%2C655.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C633.1001093749999%2C385.5956183599991%2C643.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C621.1001093749999%2C375.65061347999904%2C631.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C609.1001093749999%2C368.0854718699992%2C619.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C597.1001093749999%2C379.97016424999936%2C607.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C585.1001093749999%2C371.7259399999999%2C595.6622699999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C573.1001093749999%2C387.94554449999987%2C583.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C561.1001093749999%2C386.7858032999999%2C571.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C549.1001093749999%2C384.8059399999999%2C559.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C537.1001093749999%2C382.1259399999999%2C547.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C525.1001093749999%2C381.04594%2C535.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C513.1001093749999%2C377.9559399999999%2C523.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C501.1001093749999%2C387.00594%2C511.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C489.1001093749999%2C367.7959399999999%2C499.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C477.1001093749999%2C375.0557495999999%2C487.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C465.1001093749999%2C391.35594000000003%2C475.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C453.1001093749999%2C377.66594%2C463.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C441.1001093749999%2C375.37594000000007%2C451.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C429.1001093749999%2C366.5219199999999%2C439.66226999999986%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2266%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential.

Accordingly, international relations and statecraft provide useful tools for addressing malicious cyber activity. The United States must exercise the options at its disposal to maintain a favorable balance of power in cyberspace by employing pressure through other domains that adversaries cannot match, particularly economic means. As James Lewis, a preeminent scholar in the cyber field, stated, \u201c[t]he most effective actions to date in causing state attackers to recalculate risk have not depended on the Department of Defense or Cyber Command, but on attribution, indictments and the threat of sanctions.\u201d106\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2267%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Anderson, 2021, p. 67</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2262%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B422.00018999999975%2C681.099629375%2C557.4469899999998%2C691.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C669.099629375%2C563.5969899999999%2C679.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C657.099629375%2C568.1569899999997%2C667.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C645.099629375%2C566.6269899999996%2C655.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C633.099629375%2C567.37699%2C643.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C621.099629375%2C566.91699%2C631.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C609.099629375%2C554.2069899999997%2C619.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C597.099629375%2C572.1470290999998%2C607.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C585.099629375%2C573.1169900000002%2C595.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C573.099629375%2C570.1669118999998%2C583.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C561.099629375%2C565.7869900000001%2C571.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.99698999999976%2C549.099629375%2C567.0035099999999%2C559.6617899999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C537.099629375%2C565.7600778899999%2C547.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C525.099629375%2C573.1999899999998%2C535.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C513.099629375%2C556.66999%2C523.4300199999999%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C501.09962937499995%2C575.9999899999998%2C511.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.9999899999998%2C489.09962937499995%2C564.4997899999998%2C499.66178999999994%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C477.09962937499995%2C557.9597899999999%2C487.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C465.09962937499995%2C565.3697606999997%2C475.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C453.09962937499995%2C574.92979%2C463.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C441.09962937499995%2C565.3598974%2C451.43001999999996%5D%2C%5B403.99978999999985%2C429.09962937499995%2C554.7797899999999%2C439.43001999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2262%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAs demonstrated in Table 1,23 over the past five years, Russian state agencies have worked with several proxy groups to execute strategic objectives through cyber means against the United States.

To highlight the difference in economic spending power, in 2019, the United States spent $732 billion (3.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) on defense compared to Russia\u2019s $65.1 billion (3.9 percent of GDP).48 Recognizing its comparative position, Russia has invested in less expensive technologies that counter big, expensive U.S. weapons and systems.49 Russia\u2019s asymmetric approach is not new. It has been developing weapons to counter American power projection capabilities for decades: submarines and cruise missiles to sink aircraft carriers, service-to-air missiles to counter strategic stealth bombers, hypersonic projectiles to defeat anti-missile weapons, etc.50 In addition to being a cheaper alternative than procuring advanced weapon systems, cyber capabilities can be especially economical when conducting activities through proxies. A state can draw from a talented pool of individuals to meet specific needs and forego the costs of training associated with gaining and maintaining the required expertise.51 Cyberspace is a relatively inexpensive means to compete with and counter the United States\u2019 advantage in other domains of conflict.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2266%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B220.0005499999999%2C657.1001093749999%2C378.730613479999%2C667.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C645.1001093749999%2C383.4305499999999%2C655.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C633.1001093749999%2C385.5956183599991%2C643.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C621.1001093749999%2C375.65061347999904%2C631.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C609.1001093749999%2C368.0854718699992%2C619.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C597.1001093749999%2C379.97016424999936%2C607.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C585.1001093749999%2C371.7259399999999%2C595.6622699999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C573.1001093749999%2C387.94554449999987%2C583.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C561.1001093749999%2C386.7858032999999%2C571.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C549.1001093749999%2C384.8059399999999%2C559.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C537.1001093749999%2C382.1259399999999%2C547.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C525.1001093749999%2C381.04594%2C535.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C513.1001093749999%2C377.9559399999999%2C523.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C501.1001093749999%2C387.00594%2C511.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C489.1001093749999%2C367.7959399999999%2C499.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C477.1001093749999%2C375.0557495999999%2C487.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C465.1001093749999%2C391.35594000000003%2C475.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C453.1001093749999%2C377.66594%2C463.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C441.1001093749999%2C375.37594000000007%2C451.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C429.1001093749999%2C366.5219199999999%2C439.66226999999986%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2266%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential.

To highlight the difference in economic spending power, in 2019, the United States spent $732 billion (3.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) on defense compared to Russia\u2019s $65.1 billion (3.9 percent of GDP).48 Recognizing its comparative position, Russia has invested in less expensive technologies that counter big, expensive U.S. weapons and systems.49 Russia\u2019s asymmetric approach is not new. It has been developing weapons to counter American power projection capabilities for decades: submarines and cruise missiles to sink aircraft carriers, service-to-air missiles to counter strategic stealth bombers, hypersonic projectiles to defeat anti-missile weapons, etc.50 In addition to being a cheaper alternative than procuring advanced weapon systems, cyber capabilities can be especially economical when conducting activities through proxies. A state can draw from a talented pool of individuals to meet specific needs and forego the costs of training associated with gaining and maintaining the required expertise.51 Cyberspace is a relatively inexpensive means to compete with and counter the United States\u2019 advantage in other domains of conflict.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects. Cyberspace presents the Russian government the means to rapidly execute its information warfare operations to achieve strategic objectives in near real-time.47 Russia seeks to exploit the utility of information warfare to rapidly shape conflicts, but also understands its own vulnerabilities to the same threats.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FVY8VDTUA%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2266%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B220.0005499999999%2C657.1001093749999%2C378.730613479999%2C667.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C645.1001093749999%2C383.4305499999999%2C655.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C633.1001093749999%2C385.5956183599991%2C643.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C621.1001093749999%2C375.65061347999904%2C631.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C609.1001093749999%2C368.0854718699992%2C619.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C597.1001093749999%2C379.97016424999936%2C607.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.0005499999999%2C585.1001093749999%2C371.7259399999999%2C595.6622699999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C573.1001093749999%2C387.94554449999987%2C583.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C561.1001093749999%2C386.7858032999999%2C571.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C549.1001093749999%2C384.8059399999999%2C559.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C537.1001093749999%2C382.1259399999999%2C547.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C525.1001093749999%2C381.04594%2C535.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C513.1001093749999%2C377.9559399999999%2C523.4304999999998%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C501.1001093749999%2C387.00594%2C511.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C489.1001093749999%2C367.7959399999999%2C499.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C477.1001093749999%2C375.0557495999999%2C487.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C465.1001093749999%2C391.35594000000003%2C475.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C453.1001093749999%2C377.66594%2C463.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C441.1001093749999%2C375.37594000000007%2C451.4304999999999%5D%2C%5B220.00593999999995%2C429.1001093749999%2C366.5219199999999%2C439.66226999999986%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F6LM42EYM%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2266%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe National Cyber Strategy states, \u201c[t]he United States will formalize and make routine how we work . . . to attribute and deter malicious cyber activities with integrated strategies that impose swift, costly, and transparent consequences when malicious actors harm the United States . . . .\u201d85 To address Russian cyber proxy activity, an attribution strategy focused on American security through an aggressive cyber foreign policy is essential.

It has been developing weapons to counter American power projection capabilities for decades: submarines and cruise missiles to sink aircraft carriers, service-to-air missiles to counter strategic stealth bombers, hypersonic projectiles to defeat anti-missile weapons, etc.50 In addition to being a cheaper alternative than procuring advanced weapon systems, cyber capabilities can be especially economical when conducting activities through proxies.

To highlight the difference in economic spending power, in 2019, the United States spent $732 billion (3.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) on defense compared to Russia\u2019s $65.1 billion (3.9 percent of GDP).48 Recognizing its comparative position, Russia has invested in less expensive technologies that counter big, expensive U.S. weapons and systems.49 Russia\u2019s asymmetric approach is not new. It has been developing weapons to counter American power projection capabilities for decades: submarines and cruise missiles to sink aircraft carriers, service-to-air missiles to counter strategic stealth bombers, hypersonic projectiles to defeat anti-missile weapons, etc.50 In addition to being a cheaper alternative than procuring advanced weapon systems, cyber capabilities can be especially economical when conducting activities through proxies. A state can draw from a talented pool of individuals to meet specific needs and forego the costs of training associated with gaining and maintaining the required expertise.51 Cyberspace is a relatively inexpensive means to compete with and counter the United States\u2019 advantage in other domains of conflict.\u201d (Anderson, 2021, p. 64)", "\u201cIn 2013, General Valery Gerasimov, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, wrote an often cited\u2014and nearly as often misunderstood\u2014article stating, \u201cThe very \u2018rules of war\u2019 have changed [because of cyber and information operations]. The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness.\u201d44 As many scholars have noted, Gerasimov was not writing his article to articulate a new Russian way of war, rather he recognized that cyber operations can rapidly disseminate information to shape public opinion and topple authoritarian regimes (including Russia) as part of a larger information campaign.45 Under current doctrine, the United States \u201ctreats information operations and cyberspace operations as distinct zones organized under different Department of Defense directives, other near peer competitors, such as . . . Russia do[es] not.\u201d46 Russia recognizes the power of information platforms (i.e., social media) to disseminate information leading to strategic effects.
