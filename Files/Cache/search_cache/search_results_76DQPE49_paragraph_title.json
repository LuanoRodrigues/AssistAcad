This is followed by an examination of the existing requirements and treatment of evidence in international law for international wrongs and teases out the evidentiary thresholds that states will be required to meet to show an international wrong in cyberspace. The article concludes that while it is likely that international judicial forums will not relax standards of proof to accommodate the obvious cyber-challenges, circumstantial evidence is available as a potentially viable route to prove a violation. Since state to state disputes have been more commonly addressed in the International Court of Justice (\u2018\u2018ICJ / Court\u2019\u2019), this article will rely on the standards used by the ICJ, while also pointing out a few decisions by other international judicial forums as well.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 286)", "\u201cThe highest standard of evidence in law is posited by domestic criminal law which demands proof beyond reasonable doubt, while civil cases in most common law jurisdictions only require proof by a preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities, i.e., a more likely than not standard. While some scholars note that the nature of international litigation between states in a forum such as the ICJ is more comparable to civil litigation than criminal,20 the Court has typically refrained from laying down any particular standard of proof in the cases dealt by it, preferring to determine causality and responsibility on a case by case basis.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 290)", "\u201cOngoing efforts to examine issues in application of international law to cyberspace also do not address these issues. The International Group of Experts (IGE) tasked with creating a Manual on the Law of Cyberwarfare under the aegis of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, and whose work resulted in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be \u2018\u2018determined by the relevant forum\u2019\u2019.25 They were not wrong to do so, given that the constituting instruments of most international courts usually leave it to the court to determine issues of burden and standards of proof as well as rules of evidence on their own.26 However, significantly, the IGE in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 do opine that a cyber-attack originating from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure, while not sufficient to attribute the cyber-attack to that government, is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation.27 Even though the Tallinn Manual 1.0 also notes the dangers of spoofing and disclaims that this rule be used to pre-determine evidentiary conclusions as to attribution, if applied by states, it could give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the state from whose governmental cyber infrastructure the attack as launched was involved with the attack.28 If and when accepted by states, this would be an important development since it could significantly ease proving cyber-attacks. However, as the Tallinn Manuals stand currently, they are considered by states as more of a \u2018\u2018starting point of a conversation\u2019\u2019 than an authoritative text.29\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 291)", "\u201cPortions of the Court\u2019s decisions concerning the evidence presented before it shed some light on the prevailing standards of proof in international law considered by it. For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (\u2018\u2018Bosnian Genocide case\u2019\u2019) in which Bosnia alleged that Serbia contributed to and failed to prevent and punish acts of genocide, the Court stated that \u2018\u2018..claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019\u201921 indicating that the standard of proof in cases of exceptional gravity such as genocide was that of \u2018\u2018fully conclusive\u2019\u2019 evidence.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 290)", "\u201cHowever, for cases involving use of force, the Court has used different terminology.

The International Group of Experts (IGE) tasked with creating a Manual on the Law of Cyberwarfare under the aegis of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, and whose work resulted in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be \u2018\u2018determined by the relevant forum\u2019\u2019.25 They were not wrong to do so, given that the constituting instruments of most international courts usually leave it to the court to determine issues of burden and standards of proof as well as rules of evidence on their own.26 However, significantly, the IGE in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 do opine that a cyber-attack originating from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure, while not sufficient to attribute the cyber-attack to that government, is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation.27 Even though the Tallinn Manual 1.0 also notes the dangers of spoofing and disclaims that this rule be used to pre-determine evidentiary conclusions as to attribution, if applied by states, it could give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the state from whose governmental cyber infrastructure the attack as launched was involved with the attack.28 If and when accepted by states, this would be an important development since it could significantly ease proving cyber-attacks.

The International Group of Experts (IGE) tasked with creating a Manual on the Law of Cyberwarfare under the aegis of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, and whose work resulted in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be \u2018\u2018determined by the relevant forum\u2019\u2019.25 They were not wrong to do so, given that the constituting instruments of most international courts usually leave it to the court to determine issues of burden and standards of proof as well as rules of evidence on their own.26 However, significantly, the IGE in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 do opine that a cyber-attack originating from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure, while not sufficient to attribute the cyber-attack to that government, is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation.27 Even though the Tallinn Manual 1.0 also notes the dangers of spoofing and disclaims that this rule be used to pre-determine evidentiary conclusions as to attribution, if applied by states, it could give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the state from whose governmental cyber infrastructure the attack as launched was involved with the attack.28 If and when accepted by states, this would be an important development since it could significantly ease proving cyber-attacks.

While direct evidence establishes a conclusion, circumstantial evidence is commonly understood as evidence that establishes facts and circumstances from which reasonable inferences can be drawn to reach a conclusion. Today, the nature of digital forensic evidence and other intelligence available post any cyber-attack is circumstantial inasmuch as it only gives rise to inferences that can together lead to a conclusion. For instance, while investigating the source of Stuxnet, a malware that was designed to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment facility32, analysts took into account various facts including an article published by a former US intelligence officer one year prior to Stuxnet being discovered, outlining a strategic cyber strike against centrifuges, and the high level of sophistication in the software to conclude that the US government was involved.33 Another example is the United States indictment of the 5 PLA members in United States v.

The International Group of Experts (IGE) tasked with creating a Manual on the Law of Cyberwarfare under the aegis of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, and whose work resulted in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 and the Tallinn Manual 2.0, also did not discuss the standards and methods of proof in international law applicable for cyber-norm violations, instead leaving them to be \u2018\u2018determined by the relevant forum\u2019\u2019.25 They were not wrong to do so, given that the constituting instruments of most international courts usually leave it to the court to determine issues of burden and standards of proof as well as rules of evidence on their own.26 However, significantly, the IGE in the Tallinn Manual 1.0 do opine that a cyber-attack originating from a state\u2019s governmental cyber infrastructure, while not sufficient to attribute the cyber-attack to that government, is an indication that the state in question is associated with the operation.27 Even though the Tallinn Manual 1.0 also notes the dangers of spoofing and disclaims that this rule be used to pre-determine evidentiary conclusions as to attribution, if applied by states, it could give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the state from whose governmental cyber infrastructure the attack as launched was involved with the attack.28 If and when accepted by states, this would be an important development since it could significantly ease proving cyber-attacks. However, as the Tallinn Manuals stand currently, they are considered by states as more of a \u2018\u2018starting point of a conversation\u2019\u2019 than an authoritative text.29\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F76DQPE49%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22291%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 291</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNREIF9TL%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22286%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B62.36220169%2C568.1266723529999%2C388.3323494559001%2C578.683025653%5D%2C%5B51.02398485%2C554.1798526929999%2C388.3108301664392%2C564.736205993%5D%2C%5B51.02398485%2C540.233033033%2C388.2705351950023%2C553.580037091094%5D%2C%5B51.023141818%2C526.286908357%2C388.2671628350282%2C539.633625958094%5D%2C%5B51.023356061%2C512.3404972239999%2C388.3355649684008%2C525.687152912094%5D%2C%5B51.02361499999998%2C498.39402505600003%2C388.2877462466817%2C508.95037835600004%5D%2C%5B51.02361499999998%2C484.447205396%2C257.4212432940402%2C495.003558696%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F76DQPE49%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22286%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCyberspace presents a vast array of tools for concealment and disguise.

It concludes that circumstantial evidence is currently the most viable way of proving state responsibility for a cyber operation including cyberattacks and then contextually examines this in the backdrop of the recent malicious cyber incident at India\u2019s nuclear power plant in Kudankulam.", "doi": "10.1007/s40901-020-00113-0", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429940/", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "285-299", "short_title": "Cyberattacks", "item_id": "76DQPE49", "citation_key": "aravindakshanCyberattacksLookEvidentiary2021", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/NREIF9TL", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 272780}}], "keywords": ["#circumstantial_evidence #digital_forensic_evidence #cyber-attack_analysis #Stuxnet #United_States #inference_drawing", "#cyber-norm_violations #standards_of_proof #cyber-attack_attribution #International_Group_of_Experts #NATO_Cooperative_Cyber_Defence_Centre_of_Excellence #Tallinn_Manual_10 #Tallinn_Manual_20", "#cybercrime_concealment #malicious_cyber_acts #Aravindakshan #IP_spoofing #onion_routing #obfuscating_log_files"], "score": [4.0, 2.0, 1.333]}, "Illegally Obtained Evidence AND Cyber Operations": {"paragraph_id": [80843875, 37452373, 81536278], "section_title": ["3 Circumstantial evidence in cyberspace", "2 Standards of proof in international law", "Introduction"], "paragraph_title": ["Circumstantial evidence is critical in analyzing cyberattack origins.", "Current discussions on international law and cyberspace lack clarity on standards of proof.", "Cyberspace offers numerous methods for concealing identity and executing cybercrimes."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cEvidence is of two types \u2013(i) Direct and (ii) Indirect or Circumstantial.

It concludes that circumstantial evidence is currently the most viable way of proving state responsibility for a cyber operation including cyberattacks and then contextually examines this in the backdrop of the recent malicious cyber incident at India\u2019s nuclear power plant in Kudankulam.", "doi": "10.1007/s40901-020-00113-0", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429940/", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "285-299", "short_title": "Cyberattacks", "item_id": "76DQPE49", "citation_key": "aravindakshanCyberattacksLookEvidentiary2021", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/NREIF9TL", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 272780}}], "keywords": ["#cybercrime_concealment #malicious_cyber_acts #Aravindakshan #IP_spoofing #onion_routing #obfuscating_log_files", "#circumstantial_evidence #digital_forensic_evidence #cyber-attack_analysis #Stuxnet #United_States #inference_drawing"], "score": [3.5, 2.5]}, "Production of Evidence AND Court Powers": {"paragraph_id": [83567248, 1770903, 78457996, 47565280, 54981089, 76114353], "section_title": ["2 Standards of proof in international law", "2 Standards of proof in international law", "4 The Corfu Channel rule: when circumstantial evidence was \u2018\u2018Good Enough\u2019\u2019", "5 The Bosnian Genocide case: when circumstantial evidence was not \u2018\u2018Good Enough\u2019\u2019", "2 Standards of proof in international law", "4 The Corfu Channel rule: when circumstantial evidence was \u2018\u2018Good Enough\u2019\u2019"], "paragraph_title": ["International law's standards of proof resemble civil law standards more than criminal law standards.", "The Court requires convincing evidence for cases that involve the use of force.", "The Corfu Channel ruling allows for relaxed proof methods when direct evidence is inaccessible, but maintains a high standard of proof.", "The Court rejected the use of circumstantial evidence to prove Serbia's intent in the Bosnian Genocide case.", "Exceptional gravity cases in international law necessitate fully conclusive evidence.", "Circumstantial evidence was sufficient in the Corfu Channel case to establish Albania's responsibility."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cThe highest standard of evidence in law is posited by domestic criminal law which demands proof beyond reasonable doubt, while civil cases in most common law jurisdictions only require proof by a preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities, i.e., a more likely than not standard.

For instance, the Court in Nicaragua explicitly states that it had to ensure that \u2018\u2018the facts on which [the claim of the party appearing] is based [is] supported by convincing evidence\u2019\u201922 and that there was \u2018\u2018no clear evidence of the United States having actually exercised such a degree of control in all fields as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf.\u2019\u201923 Again, in Democratic Republic of Congo Vs Uganda (\u2018\u2018Armed Activities case\u2019\u2019) the Court kept referring to evidence that must be \u2018\u2018convincingly established\u2019\u2019 or terms such as \u2018\u2018convincing evidence\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018sufficient and convincing evidence\u2019\u2019 in the context of proving allegations of use of force.24 So the inference vis-\u00e0-vis standards of proof is that for violations of exceptional gravity, \u2018\u2018fully conclusive\u2019\u2019 evidence is required and for lesser violations, at least \u2018\u2018clear and convincing\u2019\u2019 evidence is required. Both these standards set high evidentiary bars to reach.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 291)", "\u201cThe Corfu Channel case shows that the Court allows \u2018\u2018recourse to liberal inferences of fact and circumstance\u2019\u2019 to prove state responsibility when (a) the relevant direct evidence is within the exclusive territoria control of another state and (b) the circumstantial evidence furnished is consistent with or does not contradict any direct evidence produced.40 But cyber attribution experts would do well to note that it was simply the method of proof that was relaxed in this case, and not the standard of proof. Even in cases where such circumstantial evidence is allowed to be adduced, it would still have to sufficiently meet the requisite standard of proof or threshold, which in the Corfu Channel case was characterized as \u2018\u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019\u2019. Hence, applying this to the cyber-domain can mean that the lack of evidence could allow for a lower method of proof, but the standard of proof remains high.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 294)", "\u201cIn the Bosnian Genocide case, Bosnia and Herzegovina alleged that Serbia had violated the prohibition on genocide under the Genocide Convention and had also failed in its obligation to prevent and punish the perpetrators of genocide.41 Similar to the UK in Corfu Channel, Bosnia also argued that Serbia had exclusive territorial control over the territory making it almost impossible for it to produce direct evidence showing Serbian complicity and that the Court should allow Bosnia to make liberal inferences of fact and circumstance from patterns of evidence to hold Serbia responsible for and also having the specific intent of carrying out the genocide42, i.e., the Court should use circumstantial evidence to come to a positive finding of specific intent on Serbia\u2019s part. But the Court refused to do so and held that for the requisite intent to be proven, any pattern of conduct would have to \u2018\u2018be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent.\u2019\u201943\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 295)", "\u201cPortions of the Court\u2019s decisions concerning the evidence presented before it shed some light on the prevailing standards of proof in international law considered by it. For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro (\u2018\u2018Bosnian Genocide case\u2019\u2019) in which Bosnia alleged that Serbia contributed to and failed to prevent and punish acts of genocide, the Court stated that \u2018\u2018..claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019\u201921 indicating that the standard of proof in cases of exceptional gravity such as genocide was that of \u2018\u2018fully conclusive\u2019\u2019 evidence.\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 290)", "\u201cAs far as international law is concerned, circumstantial evidence is commonly used and has sometimes even been sufficient to find states responsible for violations. In the very first dispute before it, the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ had to deal with issues involving circumstantial evidence provided by the United Kingdom (\u2018\u2018UK\u2019\u2019) and exclusive control of evidence by Albania. In the case, the UK alleged that Albania had knowledge of and failed in its obligation to warn the UK of the mines in its channel which struck two UK warships. With regard to the indirect or circumstantial evidence provided by the UK, the Court ruled that \u2018\u2018proof may be drawn from inferences of fact provided they leave no room for reasonable doubt\u2019\u2019.35 After acknowledging that the UK did not have access to evidence that was within Albania\u2019s exclusive territorial control and was hence disadvantaged by it, the Court allowed it a \u2018\u2018more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.\u2019\u201936 By establishing that Albania closely guarded the channel waters, could observe the mine-laying from the Albanian coast, and providing evidence of previous Albanian mine-sweep operations, the UK was able to establish \u2018\u2018a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion\u2019\u201937 that in the Court\u2019s opinion left \u2018\u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019\u2019 that Albania knew about the mines in the channel,38 and hence, violated its obligation to warn the UK. Other facts that corroborated the UK\u2019s claim included a declaration by the Albanian delegate in the Security Council and diplomatic notes from Albania on the passage of ships through its territorial waters.39\u201d (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 293)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNREIF9TL%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B51.023601531%2C571.414766645%2C388.28295015391427%2C581.971119945%5D%2C%5B51.023601531%2C557.467946985%2C388.34391541354694%2C568.0243002850001%5D%2C%5B51.023595780596935%2C543.5211273250001%2C388.3475019435589%2C554.0774806250001%5D%2C%5B51.02359578059696%2C529.5743076650001%2C388.26740291948306%2C540.1306609650002%5D%2C%5B51.02359578059699%2C515.6274880050001%2C388.27935794650915%2C526.1838413050002%5D%2C%5B51.02359578059699%2C501.6806683450002%2C388.3391338113309%2C512.2370216450001%5D%2C%5B51.02359578059699%2C487.73384868500017%2C388.2775303161564%2C501.082447980094%5D%2C%5B51.024159753999996%2C473.789319245%2C388.23329673800436%2C484.345672545%5D%2C%5B51.024159753999996%2C459.842499585%2C360.3205294039642%2C470.398852885%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F76DQPE49%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22290%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe highest standard of evidence in law is posited by domestic criminal law which demands proof beyond reasonable doubt, while civil cases in most common law jurisdictions only require proof by a preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities, i.e., a more likely than not standard.

With regard to the indirect or circumstantial evidence provided by the UK, the Court ruled that \u2018\u2018proof may be drawn from inferences of fact provided they leave no room for reasonable doubt\u2019\u2019.35 After acknowledging that the UK did not have access to evidence that was within Albania\u2019s exclusive territorial control and was hence disadvantaged by it, the Court allowed it a \u2018\u2018more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.\u2019\u201936 By establishing that Albania closely guarded the channel waters, could observe the mine-laying from the Albanian coast, and providing evidence of previous Albanian mine-sweep operations, the UK was able to establish \u2018\u2018a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion\u2019\u201937 that in the Court\u2019s opinion left \u2018\u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019\u2019 that Albania knew about the mines in the channel,38 and hence, violated its obligation to warn the UK. Other facts that corroborated the UK\u2019s claim included a declaration by the Albanian delegate in the Security Council and diplomatic notes from Albania on the passage of ships through its territorial waters.39\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F76DQPE49%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22293%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Aravindakshan, 2021, p. 293</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Sharngan Aravindakshan", "date": "2021", "journal": "Indian Journal of International Law", "title": "Cyberattacks: a look at evidentiary thresholds in International Law", "abstract": "This paper notes the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks on the international plane and identifies the shortcomings of \u201cpublic attribution\u201d or \u201cnaming-and-shaming\u201d, the tool currently being used by nation states to publicly call out perpetrator-states (including non-state actors) to both punish as well as deter future cyberattacks.
