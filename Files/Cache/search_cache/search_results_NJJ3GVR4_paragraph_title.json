These norms are regarded as less grave than the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore the standard applicable to them might be lower than the \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 or \u2018conclusive\u2019 standard. Needless to say, cyber operations do not by definition fall below any gravity threshold. Indeed, they may amount to use of force under certain circumstances, in which the standard would apply.

There is always the chance that supposed hints included within the code are intentionally misleading. These challenges make the task of establishing a forensic link between a perpetrator and an incident extremely difficult. Thus, cyber operations often take longer to detect and evaluate than traditional kinetic conduct.126\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)", "\u201cThe proposition that the burden of proof should be alleviated by use of indirect evidence is particularly germane in proving cyber operations, a process which require access to information that is in the exclusive control of other states. Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cIn light of these characteristics, proposals have been put forward to relax the ordinary standard of proof so as not to make the proof of responsibility for cyber operations unfeasible. 127 Specifically when at issue is a potential response to an attack through use of force, it has been argued that the time it will realistically take to correctly identify the perpetrator will make it significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of self-defense.128\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)", "\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a \u2018virtual control\u2019 test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who subsequently engages in a cyber attack. This approach combines a change in evidentiary rules alongside a modification of the rule of attribution, from \u2018effective\u2019 to \u2018virtual\u2019 control.38 As noted above, the ICJ has rejected territorial control as grounds for shifting the burden of proof. Moreover, a shift of burden of these types would require the state to which the operation has been attributed to prove negative facts.39 This creates a different challenge, which, as noted above, is itself regarded as a basis for a shift of the burden.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cThere may be other criteria for gravity, that depend on the circumstances of the specific violation, such as the extent of the harm caused by a breach. Gravity of the harm often underpins the gravity of the breach. Therefore a scale of gravity of the norm and a scale of gravity of the harm are likely to correspond. They may nonetheless diverge. The Corfu Channel case demonstrates this: the formal charge in that case was (only) the violation of the right to innocent passage, but the consequences of the violation in the circumstances were extensive death and destruction, comparable to the consequences of an illegal use of force. The differentiation between norm and harm is also relevant with regard to cyber operations that are capable of causing significant and widespread (and potentially irreparable) harm, but through violation of a norm that might not be characterised as particularly grave.79 The difficulty in determining the standard of proof by reference to extent of the harm caused is that the harm itself requires proof. Harm therefore cannot serve as an objective indicator at the outset of proceedings.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 13)", "\u201cNotably, the case law in which a specific standard was applied, namely \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019, concerned alleged violations of the prohibition on the use of force. Just as a higher standard is applicable in some cases of even greater gravity, it may be that the \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 would be deemed appropriate in cases of lower gravity.125 This may be appropriate for attribution of cyber operations that allegedly violate norms lower down the gravity scale than the use of force. Such may be the case when the allegation is only of a violation of the prohibition on non-interference or of the prohibition on violation of state sovereignty.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)", "\u201cDetermination of state responsibility for unlawful conduct in cyberspace requires (as does determination of state responsibility under international law for any unlawful conduct) proof of various facts: the commission of the unlawful conduct, the identity of the person carrying out the action, and the relationship between that person and a state. The first set of fact concerns proof of the breach of a primary rule; the second and the third concern proof of the attributability of the breach to a state, thereby generating the latter\u2019s responsibility for a wrongful act. This paper provides an overview of law and practice on three evidentiary aspects of establishing these facts: burden of proof, standard of proof, and means of proof. Alongside a general review of these evidentiary issues, it examines aspects of these issues that are likely to arise specifically with regard to cyber operations.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 1)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5271279999997%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.5159199999995%2C371.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.5283999999997%2C351.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C540.5250399999995%2C330.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.4248160000001%2C311.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cProving cyber operations may involve the use of novel types of evidence.

The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 27</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2220%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A21%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C319.52179687499995%2C540.52336%2C330.23999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.361796875%2C540.5271999999998%2C311.4647999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.20179687499996%2C540.5269599999998%2C289.91999999999996%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C258.801796875%2C540.53008%2C269.52%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C238.64179687499995%2C540.4248160000001%2C250.74479999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn light of these characteristics, proposals have been put forward to relax the ordinary standard of proof so as not to make the proof of responsibility for cyber operations unfeasible. 127 Specifically when at issue is a potential response to an attack through use of force, it has been argued that the time it will realistically take to correctly identify the perpetrator will make it significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of self-defense.128\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2220%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 20</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.5286399999999%2C310.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5283999999997%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.524536%2C269.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5415279999995%2C249.83999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C218.72179687499994%2C540.5209600000001%2C230.82479999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C198.56179687499997%2C540.5243199999998%2C209.27999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C178.40179687499995%2C540.5159199999997%2C189.11999999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries.

Gravity of the harm often underpins the gravity of the breach. Therefore a scale of gravity of the norm and a scale of gravity of the harm are likely to correspond. They may nonetheless diverge. The Corfu Channel case demonstrates this: the formal charge in that case was (only) the violation of the right to innocent passage, but the consequences of the violation in the circumstances were extensive death and destruction, comparable to the consequences of an illegal use of force. The differentiation between norm and harm is also relevant with regard to cyber operations that are capable of causing significant and widespread (and potentially irreparable) harm, but through violation of a norm that might not be characterised as particularly grave.79 The difficulty in determining the standard of proof by reference to extent of the harm caused is that the harm itself requires proof.

One is when the ordinary location of the burden gives a party some unfair advantage over the other.21 A situation where this may be the case is when the evidence is in the exclusive territorial possession of a party. In the Corfu Channel case (1949) the UK argued that its inability to obtain evidence because of Albania\u2019s control over the territory in which the events had taken place justified the reversal of the burden of proof, onto Albania. The Court rejected this argument.22 It similarly rejected the United States\u2019 contention in the Avena Case (2004) that it was for Mexico to produce information on the US nationality of certain individuals, a contention made on the ground that the facts on which such nationality depended were in Mexico\u2019s hands.23 The WTO has also not been prepared to accept that relative ease of access to pertinent information determines the allocation of the burden.24\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)", "\u201cWhile this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cIn conclusion, notwithstanding the paucity of explicit provisions, the common practice of international courts and tribunals is to assume that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact. This burden may shift in part to the other party in exceptional circumstances, although practice to this effect is rare.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cOther proposed grounds for a shift or reversal of the burden of proof are when that is perceived as the best way to ensure that the adjudicative body has the most accurate picture of the facts upon which to make judicial determinations. This rationale calls for placing the burden of proof on the better-informed party.25 It emphasises the inquisitorial character of the adjudicative process.26\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)", "\u201cThe constitutive documents of international courts and tribunals and their rules of procedure and evidence rarely contain explicit provisions on the burden of proof. The Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure state that \u2018[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the fact it relies on to support its claim or defence\u2019.15 The same stipulation is provided in UNCITRAL Rule 24(3), which was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (IUSCT). It is common practice among international other courts and tribunals that a party bears the burden of proving the facts that it relies on for its submissions.16 This allocation is based on the presumption of compliance. In the context of international law, this presumption can be embodied in the fundamental norm pacta sunt servanda, to the effect that that states not only should carry out their obligations in good faith, but are presumed to be doing so.17 It is therefore an assertion to the contrary that requires proof.18 Placing the burden of proving a fact on the party alleging it means that within the same proceedings each party bears the burden with regards to different facts,19 depending on the subject-matter and on the nature of the dispute.20\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cThe maintenance of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact, irrespective of this party\u2019s access to information is somewhat mitigated by the general duty that states are said to bear, to collaborate in good faith for the administration of evidence.32 This duty includes the obligation to provide information necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case and for the proper administration of justice more generally.33\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cIt has been suggested that the ECtHR has adopted the principle on the shift of burden specifically with regard to claims of enforced disappearance. The Court has stated that \u2018where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u2019.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cOne basis for reversal of the burden of proof that has received some judicial support is where the allegation is of a negative fact. The argument is that the respondent to such an allegation is in a superior position to prove its compliance with law through its positive action,27 and a negative fact may be impossible to prove. In the Diallo case (2010) the ICJ recognised that when the victim of an alleged violation is alleging the breach of the law through omission, the respondent state can be required to provide evidence of its active conduct in compliance with the law. The Court clarified, however, that \u2018it cannot be inferred in every case where the Respondent is unable to prove the performance of a procedural obligation that it has disregarded it: that depends to a large extent on the precise nature of the obligation in question ... The time which has elapsed since the events must also be taken into account\u2019.28\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.5307280000003%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.52744%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5241519999997%2C635.9448%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5226399999998%2C614.3279999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5243199999998%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5209599999997%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5130399999997%2C554.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5288799999998%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.5428%2C514.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5319279999997%2C492.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C193.384528%2C473.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA shift (or reversal) of the burden of proof from the party alleging a fact to its adversary has been proposed in a number of contexts.

The Court rejected this argument.22 It similarly rejected the United States\u2019 contention in the Avena Case (2004) that it was for Mexico to produce information on the US nationality of certain individuals, a contention made on the ground that the facts on which such nationality depended were in Mexico\u2019s hands.23 The WTO has also not been prepared to accept that relative ease of access to pertinent information determines the allocation of the burden.24\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 5</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.50824%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5305600000002%2C656.1048%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C454.45957599999997%2C634.56%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5276799999999%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5202399999995%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5283999999999%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C164.756728%2C371.2799999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn conclusion, notwithstanding the paucity of explicit provisions, the common practice of international courts and tribunals is to assume that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact.

The Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure state that \u2018[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the fact it relies on to support its claim or defence\u2019.15 The same stipulation is provided in UNCITRAL Rule 24(3), which was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (IUSCT). It is common practice among international other courts and tribunals that a party bears the burden of proving the facts that it relies on for its submissions.16 This allocation is based on the presumption of compliance. In the context of international law, this presumption can be embodied in the fundamental norm pacta sunt servanda, to the effect that that states not only should carry out their obligations in good faith, but are presumed to be doing so.17 It is therefore an assertion to the contrary that requires proof.18 Placing the burden of proving a fact on the party alleging it means that within the same proceedings each party bears the burden with regards to different facts,19 depending on the subject-matter and on the nature of the dispute.20\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5233599999999%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.5175999999994%2C270.16799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5204799999997%2C251.2248%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe maintenance of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact, irrespective of this party\u2019s access to information is somewhat mitigated by the general duty that states are said to bear, to collaborate in good faith for the administration of evidence.32 This duty includes the obligation to</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.526%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C265.144528%2C696.6648%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">provide information necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case and for the proper administration of justice more generally.33\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 7</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.5317599999996%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5224%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5233599999999%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5293600000002%2C614.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5367279999997%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5274399999998%2C575.2248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5493759999997%2C553.4399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5295279999998%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.52648%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5173599999997%2C492.888%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C540.5168799999999%2C473.94479999999993%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C540.52288%2C452.1599999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIt has been suggested that the ECtHR has adopted the principle on the shift of burden specifically with regard to claims of enforced disappearance. The Court has stated that \u2018where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u2019.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.53512%2C371.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.5214399999996%2C351.28799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C540.5305599999999%2C332.1047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.5209599999995%2C310.72799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5288799999997%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.5269599999997%2C269.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5391279999996%2C249.83999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C218.72179687499994%2C540.5351199999996%2C229.43999999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOne basis for reversal of the burden of proof that has received some judicial support is where the allegation is of a negative fact.

One is when the ordinary location of the burden gives a party some unfair advantage over the other.21 A situation where this may be the case is when the evidence is in the exclusive territorial possession of a party. In the Corfu Channel case (1949) the UK argued that its inability to obtain evidence because of Albania\u2019s control over the territory in which the events had taken place justified the reversal of the burden of proof, onto Albania. The Court rejected this argument.22 It similarly rejected the United States\u2019 contention in the Avena Case (2004) that it was for Mexico to produce information on the US nationality of certain individuals, a contention made on the ground that the facts on which such nationality depended were in Mexico\u2019s hands.23 The WTO has also not been prepared to accept that relative ease of access to pertinent information determines the allocation of the burden.24\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)", "\u201cThe constitutive documents of international courts and tribunals and their rules of procedure and evidence rarely contain explicit provisions on the burden of proof. The Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure state that \u2018[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the fact it relies on to support its claim or defence\u2019.15 The same stipulation is provided in UNCITRAL Rule 24(3), which was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (IUSCT). It is common practice among international other courts and tribunals that a party bears the burden of proving the facts that it relies on for its submissions.16 This allocation is based on the presumption of compliance. In the context of international law, this presumption can be embodied in the fundamental norm pacta sunt servanda, to the effect that that states not only should carry out their obligations in good faith, but are presumed to be doing so.17 It is therefore an assertion to the contrary that requires proof.18 Placing the burden of proving a fact on the party alleging it means that within the same proceedings each party bears the burden with regards to different facts,19 depending on the subject-matter and on the nature of the dispute.20\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cIn conclusion, notwithstanding the paucity of explicit provisions, the common practice of international courts and tribunals is to assume that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact. This burden may shift in part to the other party in exceptional circumstances, although practice to this effect is rare.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cWhile this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cThe maintenance of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact, irrespective of this party\u2019s access to information is somewhat mitigated by the general duty that states are said to bear, to collaborate in good faith for the administration of evidence.32 This duty includes the obligation to provide information necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case and for the proper administration of justice more generally.33\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cOther proposed grounds for a shift or reversal of the burden of proof are when that is perceived as the best way to ensure that the adjudicative body has the most accurate picture of the facts upon which to make judicial determinations. This rationale calls for placing the burden of proof on the better-informed party.25 It emphasises the inquisitorial character of the adjudicative process.26\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)", "\u201cOne basis for reversal of the burden of proof that has received some judicial support is where the allegation is of a negative fact. The argument is that the respondent to such an allegation is in a superior position to prove its compliance with law through its positive action,27 and a negative fact may be impossible to prove. In the Diallo case (2010) the ICJ recognised that when the victim of an alleged violation is alleging the breach of the law through omission, the respondent state can be required to provide evidence of its active conduct in compliance with the law. The Court clarified, however, that \u2018it cannot be inferred in every case where the Respondent is unable to prove the performance of a procedural obligation that it has disregarded it: that depends to a large extent on the precise nature of the obligation in question ... The time which has elapsed since the events must also be taken into account\u2019.28\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cThe ICJ\u2019s case law mentions numerous standards of proof: \u2018too improbable\u2019,52 \u2018consistent with the probabilities\u2019,53 proof \u2018to the Court\u2019s satisfaction\u2019,54 \u2018sufficient certainty\u2019,55 \u2018a degree of certainty\u2019,56 'decisive legal proof\u2019,57 \u2018firm conclusion\u2019,58 \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence,59 \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019,60 \u2018the most credible and probative evidence\u2019,61 \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt\u2019,62 \u2018beyond possibility of reasonable doubt\u2019,63 \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019,64 \u2018little reasonable doubt\u2019,65 and \u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019.66 Some of these terms appear synonymous (eg \u2018conclusive evidence\u2019 and \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019), especially when they appear within the same judgment; their relative strength is nonetheless difficult to ascertain. In other cases, the Court does not indicate the standard that it applies, confining itself to statements such as that \u2018the burden of proof... has not been discharged\u2019.67 In some instances it may not even be clear whether the term used by the Court designates a specific standard or simply the existence of a standard that has not been met. Such is the case when the Court states that the evidence is \u2018insufficient\u2019 to prove the allegations,68 that the applicant \u2018has not provided the Court with adequate evidence\u2019,69 or that the information before the Court \u2018does not, however, suffice to establish with the requisite certainty\u2019 the facts substantiating attributability.70\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cIt has been suggested that the ECtHR has adopted the principle on the shift of burden specifically with regard to claims of enforced disappearance. The Court has stated that \u2018where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u2019.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cO\u2019Connell argues that the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard has lost its prominence in the ECtHR, but the Varnava case suggests that this view may have been premature. That said, the Court did not actually require proof beyond reasonable doubt in that case. The Court held that it was \u2018satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case\u2019 that alleged victims of human rights violations had come under the control of Turkey.105 Other cases in the ECtHR explicitly applied a lower standard for the burden of proof. For example, in the Pakelli case (1983) the Court was \u2018satisfied\u2019 that the requirements under ECHR art 6 had been fulfilled even though the evidence was \u2018not sufficient to prove beyond all doubt\u2019 the applicant\u2019s indigence.106\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)", "\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a \u2018virtual control\u2019 test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who subsequently engages in a cyber attack. This approach combines a change in evidentiary rules alongside a modification of the rule of attribution, from \u2018effective\u2019 to \u2018virtual\u2019 control.38 As noted above, the ICJ has rejected territorial control as grounds for shifting the burden of proof. Moreover, a shift of burden of these types would require the state to which the operation has been attributed to prove negative facts.39 This creates a different challenge, which, as noted above, is itself regarded as a basis for a shift of the burden.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cIn the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ found that the burden of proof regarding collusion between Albania and Yugoslavia had not been met, since the evidence was not \u2018conclusive\u2019 or led to \u2018no firm conclusion\u2019.90 Later, when discussing the admissibility and weight of indirect evidence, the Court stated that \u2018proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt\u2019.91 These statements have been interpreted to mean that \u2018conclusiveness\u2019 and \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019 are synonymous terms. This is the common understanding following the Bosnia Genocide case (2007). In that case the Court relied on the Corfu Channel case to hold, with regard to acts enumerated in Article III of the Genocide Convention), that \u2018claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019.92 When implementing this standard the Court referred to facts that had not been \u2018conclusively established\u2019,93 or had \u2018not been established beyond any doubt\u2019 because they were \u2018not conclusively shown\u2019.94 President Higgins later confirmed that \u2018conclusiveness\u2019 and absence of \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 were comparable terms.95\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 15)", "\u201cThe IUSCT has made use of factual inferences.154 In the international human rights tribunals inferences and presumptions have played an important role. The ECtHR has held that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, death or disappearances occurring during such detention. The burden may then be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the disappearance.155 This is often referred to as a shift in the burden of proof, However, the presumption actually places the burden on the respondent party to provide evidence for other facts than the original allegation, rather than to prove the opposite of the fact claimed by the adversary.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 25)", "\u201cInternational courts and tribunals have been willing to accept circumstantial evidence and to rely on inferences and presumptions, so long as those lead to conclusions consistent with the facts and the contrary is not indicated by the record or is not compelled as a matter of law.145One justification for the use of indirect evidence is that it mitigates the inequality of arms which sometimes results from the preservation of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact.146 When the required evidence is in the exclusive control of the state, and that state does not cooperate in bringing forth that evidence, the victim state would be allowed a more liberal recourse to circumstantial evidence, including inferences of fact.147\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%225%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.5307280000003%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.52744%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5241519999997%2C635.9448%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5226399999998%2C614.3279999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5243199999998%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5209599999997%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5130399999997%2C554.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5288799999998%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.5428%2C514.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5319279999997%2C492.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C193.384528%2C473.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%7D\">\u201cA shift (or reversal) of the burden of proof from the party alleging a fact to its adversary has been proposed in a number of contexts. One is when the ordinary location of the burden gives a party some unfair advantage over the other.21 A situation where this may be the case is when the evidence is in the exclusive territorial possession of a party. In the Corfu Channel case (1949) the UK argued that its inability to obtain evidence because of Albania\u2019s control over the territory in which the events had taken place justified the reversal of the burden of proof, onto Albania. The Court rejected this argument.22 It similarly rejected the United States\u2019 contention in the Avena Case (2004) that it was for Mexico to produce information on the US nationality of certain individuals, a contention made on the ground that the facts on which such nationality depended were in Mexico\u2019s hands.23 The WTO has also not been prepared to accept that relative ease of access to pertinent information determines the allocation of the burden.24\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 5</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5312800000003%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5248%2C553.4399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.529528%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.52408%2C514.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5262399999999%2C492.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C540.5228799999999%2C472.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C540.5238399999997%2C453.54479999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5168799999999%2C432.16799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5197600000001%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.51904%2C392.8247999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.52888%2C371.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.52888%2C352.50479999999993%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C115.38452799999999%2C332.1047999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe constitutive documents of international courts and tribunals and their rules of procedure and evidence rarely contain explicit provisions on the burden of proof. The Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission\u2019s Rules of Procedure state that \u2018[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the fact it relies on to support its claim or defence\u2019.15 The same stipulation is provided in UNCITRAL Rule 24(3), which was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (IUSCT). It is common practice among international other courts and tribunals that a party bears the burden of proving the facts that it relies on for its submissions.16 This allocation is based on the presumption of compliance. In the context of international law, this presumption can be embodied in the fundamental norm pacta sunt servanda, to the effect that that states not only should carry out their obligations in good faith, but are presumed to be doing so.17 It is therefore an assertion to the contrary that requires proof.18 Placing the burden of proving a fact on the party alleging it means that within the same proceedings each party bears the burden with regards to different facts,19 depending on the subject-matter and on the nature of the dispute.20\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5276799999999%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5202399999995%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5283999999999%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C164.756728%2C371.2799999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn conclusion, notwithstanding the paucity of explicit provisions, the common practice of international courts and tribunals is to assume that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact.

In the Diallo case (2010) the ICJ recognised that when the victim of an alleged violation is alleging the breach of the law through omission, the respondent state can be required to provide evidence of its active conduct in compliance with the law. The Court clarified, however, that \u2018it cannot be inferred in every case where the Respondent is unable to prove the performance of a procedural obligation that it has disregarded it: that depends to a large extent on the</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.5319279999994%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C184.504528%2C696.6648%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%7D\">precise nature of the obligation in question ...

The Court has stated that \u2018where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u2019.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2217%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A18%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5379279999999%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.52528%2C614.3279999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5391279999998%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.52384%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5204799999999%2C554.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5271999999992%2C533.4479999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.5180799999998%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C312.90481600000004%2C494.1047999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%7D\">\u201cO\u2019Connell argues that the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard has lost its prominence in the ECtHR, but the Varnava case suggests that this view may have been premature.

The Court held that it was \u2018satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case\u2019 that alleged victims of human rights violations had come under the control of Turkey.105 Other cases in the ECtHR explicitly applied a lower standard for the burden of proof.

The ECtHR has held that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, death or disappearances occurring during such detention. The burden may then be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the disappearance.155 This is often referred to as a shift in the burden of proof, However, the presumption actually places the burden on the respondent party to provide evidence for other facts than the original allegation, rather than to prove the opposite of the fact claimed by the adversary.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 25</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A24%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C329.84179687499994%2C540.5269599999999%2C340.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C309.681796875%2C540.52624%2C320.4%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C289.52179687499995%2C540.5163999999997%2C301.62479999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C269.121796875%2C540.5211999999997%2C279.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C248.96179687499995%2C540.5245599999998%2C261.06479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cInternational courts and tribunals have been willing to accept circumstantial evidence and to rely on inferences and presumptions, so long as those lead to conclusions consistent with the facts and the contrary is not indicated by the record or is not compelled as a matter of law.145One justification for the use of indirect evidence is that it mitigates the inequality of arms which sometimes results from the preservation of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact.146 When the required evidence is</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.530728%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C540.5233599999999%2C695.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C664.401796875%2C165.544816%2C676.5047999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%7D\">in the exclusive control of the state, and that state does not cooperate in bringing forth that evidence, the victim state would be allowed a more liberal recourse to circumstantial evidence, including inferences of fact.147\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 24</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Yael Ronen", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Some Evidentiary Dimensions of Attributing Unlawful Cyber Operations to States", "abstract": "This project is part of a larger research initiative to examine the feasibility and advisability of an international attribution mechanism dedicated to hostile cyber operations.

Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a \u2018virtual control\u2019 test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who subsequently engages in a cyber attack. This approach combines a change in evidentiary rules alongside a modification of the rule of attribution, from \u2018effective\u2019 to \u2018virtual\u2019 control.38 As noted above, the ICJ has rejected territorial control as grounds for shifting the burden of proof. Moreover, a shift of burden of these types would require the state to which the operation has been attributed to prove negative facts.39 This creates a different challenge, which, as noted above, is itself regarded as a basis for a shift of the burden.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cRoscini suggests that digital evidence is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role in establishing state responsibility for cyber operations. It is volatile, has a short life span, and is frequently located in foreign countries. Collecting it is time consuming and requires cooperation from relevant internet service providers, which may be particularly difficult to obtain when the attack originates from other states. In any case, digital evidence will likely lead to proving of only one element in the chain of attribution, namely identification of the computer or computer system from which the cyber operation originates. It would not necessarily identify the individuals responsible for the cyber operation and would say nothing about the relationship between that person and a state.171\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cProving cyber operations may involve the use of novel types of evidence. Given the liberal approach of courts and tribunals to admission of evidence, this novelty does not in itself seem to present particular challenges. For example, there is likely to be a significant amount of digital evidence. The use of such evidence in inter-state litigation has been almost entirely neglected by international law scholarship, with the exception of studies of the use of digital evidence before criminal tribunals.170\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cNotably, the case law in which a specific standard was applied, namely \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019, concerned alleged violations of the prohibition on the use of force. Just as a higher standard is applicable in some cases of even greater gravity, it may be that the \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 would be deemed appropriate in cases of lower gravity.125 This may be appropriate for attribution of cyber operations that allegedly violate norms lower down the gravity scale than the use of force. Such may be the case when the allegation is only of a violation of the prohibition on non-interference or of the prohibition on violation of state sovereignty.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)", "\u201cCollection of evidence to prove state responsibility for cyber operations may involve violation of various norms: cyber espionage may constitute a violation of state sovereignty;174 international human rights and specifically the right to privacy are also likely to be implicated. This renders the question on the admissibility of illegal obtained evidence highly pertinent.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cThere has been considerable scholarly debate on the Court\u2019s choice in the Bosnia Genocide case to apply the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard for proving violations of Article III of the Genocide Convention.42 However, the Court\u2019s statement that the standard of proof relating to the breach also attaches to the proof of attributability has received little attention.43 Exceptionally, Milanovic argues that attribution, as a legal operation regulated by secondary norms, should be unaffected by the nature of the primary rules concerned.44 This view is supported by the preparatory work of the Articles on Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). In its 1974 report on the draft articles, the International Law Commission (ILC) emphasised that in order to establish international responsibility based on the conduct of persons acting on behalf of the state (then Draft Article 8, roughly corresponding to existing Articles 8 and 9), \u2018it must be genuinely proved that the person or group of persons were actually appointed by organs of the State\u2019.45 Whatever may be the precise meaning of \u2018genuinely proved\u2019, it is important that the Commission set it as the standard for proving attributability, not suggesting that this standard is in any way related to the proof of the breach of the primary rule. In the commentary to the final draft, the ILC noted that questions of evidence and proof of the breach fall entirely outside the scope of the draft articles.46 It did not regard the proof of the breach and the proof of attribution as connected to each other.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cReservations about linking the standard of proof for attribution with the for the breach may have also been voiced by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. The Commission addressed the suggestion that because the claims may involve allegations of potentially criminal individual conduct, a particularly high standard of proof should apply, corresponding to that applicable in criminal proceedings against individuals. The Commission rejected this suggestion, stating that \u2018The possibility that particular findings may involve very serious matters does not change the international law rules to be applied or fundamentally transform the quantum of evidence required\u2019.47 This statement suggests a principled stance, whereby the severity of the primary rules allegedly breached does not affect the evidentiary requirements. This broad statement is nonetheless mitigated (perhaps even contradicted) in the preceding paragraph, where the Commission explicitly agrees with both parties that \u2018Particularly in light of the gravity of some of the claims advanced, the Commission will require clear and convincing evidence in support of its findings\u2019.48 A similar ambiguity exists in the separate opinion of Judge Gaja in the ICJ\u2019s Croatia Genocide case (2015), who relied on the Commission\u2019s view.49\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cThe case most often cited as establishing the existence of an objective (if elusive) standard of proof in the ICJ is the Corfu Channel case (1949). When examining the evidence for the UK\u2019s contention that Albania had colluded with Yugoslavia in laying the minefield, the Court stated that a \u2018charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here\u2019.40 The Corfu Channel case actually revolved around attribution (in that case, through complicity). Subsequent cases in the ICJ and elsewhere refer to it with regard to proving both attributability and the breach, making no distinction between the two.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A28%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.5283279999998%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C540.5295999999998%2C695.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.5247279999999%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.52288%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5281599999996%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5271279999997%2C614.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5238399999996%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5223279999993%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5286400000001%2C554.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5343999999996%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.533128%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.52648%2C492.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C540.5235999999995%2C472.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C328.9848160000001%2C453.54479999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe proposition that the burden of proof should be alleviated by use of indirect evidence is particularly germane in proving cyber operations, a process which require access to information that is in the exclusive control of other states.

Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 27</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.5286399999999%2C310.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5283999999997%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.524536%2C269.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5415279999995%2C249.83999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C218.72179687499994%2C540.5209600000001%2C230.82479999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C198.56179687499997%2C540.5243199999998%2C209.27999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C178.40179687499995%2C540.5159199999997%2C189.11999999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a \u2018virtual control\u2019 test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.5298399999997%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C428.58452800000003%2C696.6648%5D%2C%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.5318320000001%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5175279999996%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5216799999998%2C635.9448%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C276.25952799999993%2C614.1599999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">subsequently engages in a cyber attack.

In its 1974 report on the draft articles, the International Law Commission (ILC) emphasised that in order to establish international responsibility based on the conduct of persons acting on behalf of the state (then Draft Article 8, roughly corresponding to existing Articles 8 and 9), \u2018it must be genuinely proved that the person or group of persons were actually appointed by organs of the State\u2019.45 Whatever may be the precise meaning of \u2018genuinely proved\u2019, it is important that the Commission set it as the standard for proving attributability, not suggesting that this standard is in any way related to the proof of the breach of the primary rule. In the commentary to the final draft, the ILC noted that questions of evidence and proof of the breach fall entirely outside the scope of the draft articles.46 It did not regard the proof of the breach and the proof of attribution as connected to each other.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 9</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.5367280000004%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C540.5284%2C695.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.535528%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5343280000002%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5285679999995%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5379279999997%2C614.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5223999999996%2C595.3848%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.528328%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5331279999995%2C553.4399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5336799999997%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.527128%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5281599999997%2C494.1047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C495.784528%2C473.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cReservations about linking the standard of proof for attribution with the for the breach may have also been voiced by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. The Commission addressed the suggestion that because the claims may involve allegations of potentially criminal individual conduct, a particularly high standard of proof should apply, corresponding to that applicable in criminal proceedings against individuals. The Commission rejected this suggestion, stating that \u2018The possibility that particular findings may involve very serious matters does not change the international law rules to be applied or fundamentally transform the quantum of evidence required\u2019.47 This statement suggests a principled stance, whereby the severity of the primary rules allegedly breached does not affect the evidentiary requirements. This broad statement is nonetheless mitigated (perhaps even contradicted) in the preceding paragraph, where the Commission explicitly agrees with both parties that \u2018Particularly in light of the gravity of some of the claims advanced, the Commission will require clear and convincing evidence in support of its findings\u2019.48 A similar ambiguity exists in the separate opinion of Judge Gaja in the ICJ\u2019s Croatia Genocide case (2015), who relied on the Commission\u2019s view.49\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 10</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5320239999998%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.5331999999997%2C270.16799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5115999999999%2C249.83999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C218.72179687499994%2C540.424528%2C230.82479999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C198.56179687499997%2C540.5283999999997%2C209.44799999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C178.40179687499995%2C540.5228799999999%2C189.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C158.00179687499997%2C310.71556%2C168.71999999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe case most often cited as establishing the existence of an objective (if elusive) standard of proof in the ICJ is the Corfu Channel case (1949).

These questions may arise for different purposes, not all of them legal. Even in a legal setting, proof of attribution may be required for different purposes, entailing different evidentiary standards.9 Specifically in the context of attribution of attacks, conventional or through cyber operations, the question has arisen whether the evidentiary requirements, in particular the standard of proof, would differ depending on whether the at issue is the legality of the alleged attack; or the legality of the response to it, in which case the attack is a fact that requires proof rather than a wrongful act in itself.

These questions may arise for different purposes, not all of them legal. Even in a legal setting, proof of attribution may be required for different purposes, entailing different evidentiary standards.9 Specifically in the context of attribution of attacks, conventional or through cyber operations, the question has arisen whether the evidentiary requirements, in particular the standard of proof, would differ depending on whether the at issue is the legality of the alleged attack; or the legality of the response to it, in which case the attack is a fact that requires proof rather than a wrongful act in itself. If the requirements differ, it is not obvious in which of the cases the standards should be higher.10 The ICJ\u2019s practice suggests that the standard would not differ.11 The same approach emerges from scholarly work12 and from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual, which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach to which a victim state contemplates a response, rather than to whether the question arises before a response or retrospectively in Court.

The Commission addressed the suggestion that because the claims may involve allegations of potentially criminal individual conduct, a particularly high standard of proof should apply, corresponding to that applicable in criminal proceedings against individuals. The Commission rejected this suggestion, stating that \u2018The possibility that particular findings may involve very serious matters does not change the international law rules to be applied or fundamentally transform the quantum of evidence required\u2019.47 This statement suggests a principled stance, whereby the severity of the primary rules allegedly breached does not affect the evidentiary requirements. This broad statement is nonetheless mitigated (perhaps even contradicted) in the preceding paragraph, where the Commission explicitly agrees with both parties that \u2018Particularly in light of the gravity of some of the claims advanced, the Commission will require clear and convincing evidence in support of its findings\u2019.48 A similar ambiguity exists in the separate opinion of Judge Gaja in the ICJ\u2019s Croatia Genocide case (2015), who relied on the Commission\u2019s view.49\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 10)", "\u201cThe proposition that the burden of proof should be alleviated by use of indirect evidence is particularly germane in proving cyber operations, a process which require access to information that is in the exclusive control of other states. Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cThere has been considerable scholarly debate on the Court\u2019s choice in the Bosnia Genocide case to apply the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard for proving violations of Article III of the Genocide Convention.42 However, the Court\u2019s statement that the standard of proof relating to the breach also attaches to the proof of attributability has received little attention.43 Exceptionally, Milanovic argues that attribution, as a legal operation regulated by secondary norms, should be unaffected by the nature of the primary rules concerned.44 This view is supported by the preparatory work of the Articles on Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). In its 1974 report on the draft articles, the International Law Commission (ILC) emphasised that in order to establish international responsibility based on the conduct of persons acting on behalf of the state (then Draft Article 8, roughly corresponding to existing Articles 8 and 9), \u2018it must be genuinely proved that the person or group of persons were actually appointed by organs of the State\u2019.45 Whatever may be the precise meaning of \u2018genuinely proved\u2019, it is important that the Commission set it as the standard for proving attributability, not suggesting that this standard is in any way related to the proof of the breach of the primary rule. In the commentary to the final draft, the ILC noted that questions of evidence and proof of the breach fall entirely outside the scope of the draft articles.46 It did not regard the proof of the breach and the proof of attribution as connected to each other.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 9)", "\u201cThe case most often cited as establishing the existence of an objective (if elusive) standard of proof in the ICJ is the Corfu Channel case (1949). When examining the evidence for the UK\u2019s contention that Albania had colluded with Yugoslavia in laying the minefield, the Court stated that a \u2018charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here\u2019.40 The Corfu Channel case actually revolved around attribution (in that case, through complicity). Subsequent cases in the ICJ and elsewhere refer to it with regard to proving both attributability and the breach, making no distinction between the two.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cRoscini suggests that digital evidence is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role in establishing state responsibility for cyber operations. It is volatile, has a short life span, and is frequently located in foreign countries. Collecting it is time consuming and requires cooperation from relevant internet service providers, which may be particularly difficult to obtain when the attack originates from other states. In any case, digital evidence will likely lead to proving of only one element in the chain of attribution, namely identification of the computer or computer system from which the cyber operation originates. It would not necessarily identify the individuals responsible for the cyber operation and would say nothing about the relationship between that person and a state.171\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cThe transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a \u2018virtual control\u2019 test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who subsequently engages in a cyber attack. This approach combines a change in evidentiary rules alongside a modification of the rule of attribution, from \u2018effective\u2019 to \u2018virtual\u2019 control.38 As noted above, the ICJ has rejected territorial control as grounds for shifting the burden of proof. Moreover, a shift of burden of these types would require the state to which the operation has been attributed to prove negative facts.39 This creates a different challenge, which, as noted above, is itself regarded as a basis for a shift of the burden.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)", "\u201cNotably, the case law in which a specific standard was applied, namely \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019, concerned alleged violations of the prohibition on the use of force. Just as a higher standard is applicable in some cases of even greater gravity, it may be that the \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 would be deemed appropriate in cases of lower gravity.125 This may be appropriate for attribution of cyber operations that allegedly violate norms lower down the gravity scale than the use of force. Such may be the case when the allegation is only of a violation of the prohibition on non-interference or of the prohibition on violation of state sovereignty.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.5367280000004%2C715.4399999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C540.5284%2C695.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.535528%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5343280000002%2C654.7199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5285679999995%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5379279999997%2C614.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.5223999999996%2C595.3848%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.528328%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5331279999995%2C553.4399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5336799999997%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.527128%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5281599999997%2C494.1047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C495.784528%2C473.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cReservations about linking the standard of proof for attribution with the for the breach may have also been voiced by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.

The Commission rejected this suggestion, stating that \u2018The possibility that particular findings may involve very serious matters does not change the international law rules to be applied or fundamentally transform the quantum of evidence required\u2019.47 This statement suggests a principled stance, whereby the severity of the primary rules allegedly breached does not affect the evidentiary requirements.

Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 27</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%229%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A10%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5168799999999%2C614.3279999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.53536%2C593.9999999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5216800000001%2C575.2248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.508%2C554.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5414319999998%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.5187999999998%2C514.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5325039999997%2C492.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C540.5238399999998%2C472.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C540.5224000000001%2C452.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5171199999997%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5262399999999%2C413.2247999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5238399999998%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.5228799999999%2C371.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.5282559999995%2C351.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C540.5307999999999%2C332.1047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C365.70856000000003%2C310.55999999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere has been considerable scholarly debate on the Court\u2019s choice in the Bosnia Genocide case to apply the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard for proving violations of Article III of the Genocide Convention.42 However, the Court\u2019s statement that the standard of proof relating to the breach also attaches to the proof of attributability has received little attention.43 Exceptionally, Milanovic argues that attribution, as a legal operation regulated by secondary norms, should be unaffected by the nature of the primary rules concerned.44 This view is supported by the preparatory work of the Articles on Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). In its 1974 report on the draft articles, the International Law Commission (ILC) emphasised that in order to establish international responsibility based on the conduct of persons acting on behalf of the state (then Draft Article 8, roughly corresponding to existing Articles 8 and 9), \u2018it must be genuinely proved that the person or group of persons were actually appointed by organs of the State\u2019.45 Whatever may be the precise meaning of \u2018genuinely proved\u2019, it is important that the Commission set it as the standard for proving attributability, not suggesting that this standard is in any way related to the proof of the breach of the primary rule. In the commentary to the final draft, the ILC noted that questions of evidence and proof of the breach fall entirely outside the scope of the draft articles.46 It did not regard the proof of the breach and the proof of attribution as connected to each other.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 9</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%228%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A9%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5320239999998%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.5331999999997%2C270.16799999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C239.12179687499997%2C540.5115999999999%2C249.83999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C218.72179687499994%2C540.424528%2C230.82479999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C198.56179687499997%2C540.5283999999997%2C209.44799999999998%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C178.40179687499995%2C540.5228799999999%2C189.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C158.00179687499997%2C310.71556%2C168.71999999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%228%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe case most often cited as establishing the existence of an objective (if elusive) standard of proof in the ICJ is the Corfu Channel case (1949).

As for general principles of law, those might have been expected to be derived from principles common to the various national legal systems, since every domestic court applies (explicitly or implicitly) some kind of procedural law. However, a comparative examination reveals that at least with regard to the standard of proof there is no uniformity that could be the basis for general principles.1 This paper therefore focuses on the practice of international tribunals and on potential trends that can be ascertained from it.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 2)", "\u201cIn human rights tribunals, an additional justifications for use of indirect evidence is the imbalance of power between the parties in cases based on individual applications. Individuals lack both the resources and the power of the defendant state.148 For example, in the Vel\u00e1squez Rodr\u00edguez case the IACtHR noted that in cases of repression characterized by attempts to suppress information, circumstantial or presumptive evidence becomes especially important.149\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cCoherence should not be confused with uniformity. The law of evidence is (or ought to be) designed to correspond to the characteristics of the dispute settlement mechanism.6 Given the variety of such mechanisms in the international arena, a variety of evidentiary bodies of law is to be expected (although, as will be seen, existing practice displays significant uniformity). Factors such as the type of parties (states or private actors), the composition of the bench,7 the technical complexity of issues and the expertise of the mechanism, and the distance in time and space from the alleged breach, raise different evidentiary concerns. In devising a mechanism for dispute settlement, generalisations based on the practice of tribunals should be therefore be drawn with caution.8\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 3)", "\u201cThe rules of procedure of international courts and tribunals generally do not place constraints on admissibility of evidence. ICJ practice has been very liberal, with a preference to admitting all evidence and distinguishing it according to probative value and reliability. This approach was explained by ICJ Former President Rosalyn Higgins on the ground that \u2018[t]he parties are entitled to expect that we will examine every single thing that they put before us, and we do\u2019.135 The respect for state sovereignty which this approach reflects is ingrained in the ICJ\u2019s procedure.136 It might be less determinative in the procedure of other dispute settlement mechanisms.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 22)", "\u201cThe maintenance of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact, irrespective of this party\u2019s access to information is somewhat mitigated by the general duty that states are said to bear, to collaborate in good faith for the administration of evidence.32 This duty includes the obligation to provide information necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case and for the proper administration of justice more generally.33\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)", "\u201cA characteristic of digital evidence is that parties may be particularly reluctant to reveal the sources and procedures through which they had obtained the evidence it has submitted. While there are no sanctions for this, the litigating party bears the risk that the evidence is excluded or given reduced weight and that the facts it claims will not be considered sufficiently proved,172 due to the inability to establish the authenticity, accuracy and completeness of the evidence.173\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cRoscini suggests that digital evidence is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role in establishing state responsibility for cyber operations. It is volatile, has a short life span, and is frequently located in foreign countries. Collecting it is time consuming and requires cooperation from relevant internet service providers, which may be particularly difficult to obtain when the attack originates from other states. In any case, digital evidence will likely lead to proving of only one element in the chain of attribution, namely identification of the computer or computer system from which the cyber operation originates. It would not necessarily identify the individuals responsible for the cyber operation and would say nothing about the relationship between that person and a state.171\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)", "\u201cThe proposition that the burden of proof should be alleviated by use of indirect evidence is particularly germane in proving cyber operations, a process which require access to information that is in the exclusive control of other states. Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)", "\u201cWhile this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201c\u2018Preponderance of evidence\u2019 generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility. Various commentators hold that the standard of proof most commonly used in international litigation is that of preponderance of evidence.122 However, ICJ case law relating to state responsibility does not apply this standard. It has been used in the IUSCT,123 and has been mentioned or proposed \u2013 but has not been the basis for ruling \u2013 in a number of separate opinions and dissents.124\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%221%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C182.72179687499994%2C540.5324800000001%2C193.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C162.56179687499997%2C540.52648%2C173.27999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C142.16179687499994%2C540.526%2C152.87999999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThere are few treaty provisions relating to matters of evidence in international tribunals, and those that exist are often imprecise.

Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state\u2019s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 27</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%224%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.50824%2C675.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5305600000002%2C656.1048%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C454.45957599999997%2C634.56%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWhile this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 4</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2219%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A20%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5240799999996%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5338240000002%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5245600000001%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.5353600000001%2C372.66479999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2219%22%7D%7D\">\u201c\u2018Preponderance of evidence\u2019 generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility.

These questions may arise for different purposes, not all of them legal. Even in a legal setting, proof of attribution may be required for different purposes, entailing different evidentiary standards.9 Specifically in the context of attribution of attacks, conventional or through cyber operations, the question has arisen whether the evidentiary requirements, in particular the standard of proof, would differ depending on whether the at issue is the legality of the alleged attack; or the legality of the response to it, in which case the attack is a fact that requires proof rather than a wrongful act in itself. If the requirements differ, it is not obvious in which of the cases the standards should be higher.10 The ICJ\u2019s practice suggests that the standard would not differ.11 The same approach emerges from scholarly work12 and from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual, which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach to which a victim state contemplates a response, rather than to whether the question arises before a response or retrospectively in Court. However, according to the Manual, the reasonableness of the state\u2019s assessment whether the relevant standard has been met has to be evaluated by reference to the circumstances in which its decision was taken. This assessment depends on such factors as reliability, quantum, directness, nature and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.13\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)", "\u201cInternational courts and tribunals have been willing to accept circumstantial evidence and to rely on inferences and presumptions, so long as those lead to conclusions consistent with the facts and the contrary is not indicated by the record or is not compelled as a matter of law.145One justification for the use of indirect evidence is that it mitigates the inequality of arms which sometimes results from the preservation of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact.146 When the required evidence is in the exclusive control of the state, and that state does not cooperate in bringing forth that evidence, the victim state would be allowed a more liberal recourse to circumstantial evidence, including inferences of fact.147\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)", "\u201cThe ICJ\u2019s case law mentions numerous standards of proof: \u2018too improbable\u2019,52 \u2018consistent with the probabilities\u2019,53 proof \u2018to the Court\u2019s satisfaction\u2019,54 \u2018sufficient certainty\u2019,55 \u2018a degree of certainty\u2019,56 'decisive legal proof\u2019,57 \u2018firm conclusion\u2019,58 \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence,59 \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019,60 \u2018the most credible and probative evidence\u2019,61 \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt\u2019,62 \u2018beyond possibility of reasonable doubt\u2019,63 \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019,64 \u2018little reasonable doubt\u2019,65 and \u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019.66 Some of these terms appear synonymous (eg \u2018conclusive evidence\u2019 and \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019), especially when they appear within the same judgment; their relative strength is nonetheless difficult to ascertain. In other cases, the Court does not indicate the standard that it applies, confining itself to statements such as that \u2018the burden of proof... has not been discharged\u2019.67 In some instances it may not even be clear whether the term used by the Court designates a specific standard or simply the existence of a standard that has not been met. Such is the case when the Court states that the evidence is \u2018insufficient\u2019 to prove the allegations,68 that the applicant \u2018has not provided the Court with adequate evidence\u2019,69 or that the information before the Court \u2018does not, however, suffice to establish with the requisite certainty\u2019 the facts substantiating attributability.70\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cIt is common practice in domestic law that different standards of proof apply in different areas of law: \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 in criminal law, \u2018balance of probabilities\u2019 in civil law, etc. The different standards correspond to the different legal consequences that each body of law carries. International law pertaining to state responsibility does not divide into the same categories, but different types of internationally wrongful do carry different consequences. There may is therefore be merit in a scale that reflects these differences.74\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 12)", "\u201cThe \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 has also featured in other judicial proceedings. The European Commission and the European Court of Human rights (ECtHR) applied this standard in the Greek Case (1969) (alleging an administrative practice of torture)96 and in the Ireland v UK case (1978) (alleging conduct constituting torture).97 The Court also enunciated this as the applicable standard in the Varnava v Turkey case (2009) (alleging conducting amount to enforced disappearances).98 One explanation for the choice of the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard may that all cases concerned systematic violations of non-derogable rights amounting to international crimes (although not ones susceptible in practice to prosecution in an international tribunal). However the Court itself had distanced itself from this interpretation in the Nachova case (2005) when it stated that it did not intend to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard, since its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but to ensure the observance by Contracting States\u2019 of their obligation to secure rights under the Convention.99 A different explanation may be that the Court followed the civil law system, where full persuasion of the judge is required both in criminal and in civil cases.100\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 16)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%223%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.5295279999995%2C553.4399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5171199999999%2C533.2799999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.5276799999999%2C513.1199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C540.5207199999999%2C494.1047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C461.84179687499994%2C540.5280639999999%2C472.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C540.5269599999997%2C452.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.5365599999999%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.52744%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5255199999999%2C392.8247999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.5287360000002%2C372.66479999999996%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.5960799999997%2C351.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C540.5320000000002%2C330.71999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.5307279999997%2C310.55999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.5240799999998%2C290.15999999999997%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C259.28179687499994%2C540.5307279999995%2C269.99999999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis paper is specifically concerned with the evidentiary questions as they pertain to attribution of state responsibility.

The European Commission and the European Court of Human rights (ECtHR) applied this standard in the Greek Case (1969) (alleging an administrative practice of torture)96 and in the Ireland v UK case (1978) (alleging conduct constituting torture).97 The Court also enunciated this as the applicable standard in the Varnava v Turkey case (2009) (alleging conducting amount to enforced disappearances).98 One explanation for the choice of the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard may that all cases concerned systematic violations of non-derogable rights amounting to international crimes (although not ones susceptible in practice to prosecution in an international tribunal). However the Court itself had distanced itself from this interpretation in the Nachova case (2005) when it stated that it did not intend to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard, since its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but to ensure the observance by Contracting States\u2019 of their obligation to secure rights under the Convention.99 A different explanation may be that the Court followed the civil law system, where full persuasion of the judge is required both in criminal and in civil cases.100\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 16</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Yael Ronen", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Some Evidentiary Dimensions of Attributing Unlawful Cyber Operations to States", "abstract": "This project is part of a larger research initiative to examine the feasibility and advisability of an international attribution mechanism dedicated to hostile cyber operations.

International tribunals therefore resort to steps such as making adverse inferences against a party only as a last resort and under special circumstances.166 Gattini holds that only an unjustified refusal by a party to produce documents as requested by the Court could justify adverse inferences, as only then is it a violation of the obligation to cooperate bona fide with the Court in the establishment of judicial truth,.167\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 26)", "\u201cAlongside the liberal policy of admissibility, through the case law the ICJ has established principles on the relative probative value and reliability that it would attach to different categories of evidence.137 The factors that the Court has clarified for assessing the relevance and probative value of documentary evidence have been summarised as follows.138 \u2022 Sources: whether the sources are partisan or independent, and whether they are corroborated by other evidence.139 Interest: whether the source of the evidence has an interest in the conduct of proceedings, or is neutral and indifferent, and whether the evidence contains any admissions against the interest of the party submitting it.140 \u2022 Relation to events: whether the evidence records direct observation or hearsay. 141 \u2022 Method: the means and methodology by which the information presented has been collected. \u2022 Verification: evidence will be considered to be more valuable if it has been subject to crossexamination either during its compilation or subsequently, and if it is corroborated by other sources.142 \u2022 Contemporaneity: generally less weight attaches to evidence which was not prepared or given at a time close to the facts it purports to prove. Equally, more caution is due with respect to documents prepared specifically for the purposes of litigation.143 \u2022 Procedure: whether the evidence was correctly submitted in accordance with procedural requirements. In 2011 the Court introduced the concept of \u2018legal significance\u2019. It denied such significance (ie probative value) to documents based on of formality, authorship, inaction, attribution, and notice. This has been harshly criticized by Judge Simma.144\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 23)", "\u201cIt has been suggested that the ECtHR has adopted the principle on the shift of burden specifically with regard to claims of enforced disappearance. The Court has stated that \u2018where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities\u2019.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)", "\u201cThe ICJ\u2019s case law mentions numerous standards of proof: \u2018too improbable\u2019,52 \u2018consistent with the probabilities\u2019,53 proof \u2018to the Court\u2019s satisfaction\u2019,54 \u2018sufficient certainty\u2019,55 \u2018a degree of certainty\u2019,56 'decisive legal proof\u2019,57 \u2018firm conclusion\u2019,58 \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence,59 \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019,60 \u2018the most credible and probative evidence\u2019,61 \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt\u2019,62 \u2018beyond possibility of reasonable doubt\u2019,63 \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019,64 \u2018little reasonable doubt\u2019,65 and \u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019.66 Some of these terms appear synonymous (eg \u2018conclusive evidence\u2019 and \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019), especially when they appear within the same judgment; their relative strength is nonetheless difficult to ascertain. In other cases, the Court does not indicate the standard that it applies, confining itself to statements such as that \u2018the burden of proof... has not been discharged\u2019.67 In some instances it may not even be clear whether the term used by the Court designates a specific standard or simply the existence of a standard that has not been met. Such is the case when the Court states that the evidence is \u2018insufficient\u2019 to prove the allegations,68 that the applicant \u2018has not provided the Court with adequate evidence\u2019,69 or that the information before the Court \u2018does not, however, suffice to establish with the requisite certainty\u2019 the facts substantiating attributability.70\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 11)", "\u201cThe question of admissibility could have arisen in a few cases where at issue was evidence that had been obtained illegally. The ICJ has never specifically rejected such evidence. In the Corfu Channel case the UK submitted evidence acquired, despite Albanian protest, through minesweeping operations in Albanian waters. The Court did not exclude the evidence. The reason may be that Albania did not challenge its admissibility; or it may be the general policy described above, of regarding flaws in the evidence as a factor for weighing it rather than for its exclusion.175\u201d (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2226%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A27%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C441.4417968749999%2C540.5269599999999%2C452.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C421.28179687499994%2C540.52048%2C431.99999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C401.121796875%2C540.5298400000001%2C411.84%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C380.72179687499994%2C540.5346400000001%2C391.43999999999994%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C360.5617968749999%2C540.4248160000001%2C372.66479999999996%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C340.40179687499995%2C540.5288559999995%2C351.11999999999995%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C320.00179687499997%2C540.5168799999999%2C330.888%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C343.62481600000007%2C311.94479999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2226%22%7D%7D\">\u201cNotwithstanding the power, adverse inferences from refusal to provide information have not often been utilised.

The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant\u2019s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 6</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A11%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B90.519928%2C299.84179687499994%2C540.5262399999997%2C311.94479999999993%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C279.44179687499997%2C540.424528%2C291.54479999999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe ICJ\u2019s case law mentions numerous standards of proof: \u2018too improbable\u2019,52 \u2018consistent with the probabilities\u2019,53 proof \u2018to the Court\u2019s satisfaction\u2019,54 \u2018sufficient certainty\u2019,55 \u2018a degree of certainty\u2019,56</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F3R2MZGXM%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A12%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.519928%2C704.7217968749999%2C540.424528%2C716.8248%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C684.5617968749999%2C540.5250399999998%2C696.6648%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C664.401796875%2C540.52984%2C676.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C644.001796875%2C540.5269599999995%2C656.1048%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C623.841796875%2C540.5250399999998%2C634.56%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C603.4417968749999%2C540.5291199999998%2C614.1599999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C583.2817968749999%2C540.424528%2C595.3848%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C563.121796875%2C540.5291199999995%2C573.8399999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C542.721796875%2C540.53512%2C553.608%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C522.5617968749999%2C540.5245599999997%2C534.6648%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C502.40179687499995%2C540.53344%2C514.5047999999999%5D%2C%5B72.519928%2C482.00179687499997%2C470.58452800000003%2C494.1047999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%7D\">'decisive legal proof\u2019,57 \u2018firm conclusion\u2019,58 \u2018conclusive\u2019 evidence,59 \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019,60 \u2018the most credible and probative evidence\u2019,61 \u2018beyond any reasonable doubt\u2019,62 \u2018beyond possibility of reasonable doubt\u2019,63 \u2018no reasonable doubt\u2019,64 \u2018little reasonable doubt\u2019,65 and \u2018no room for reasonable doubt\u2019.66 Some of these terms appear synonymous (eg \u2018conclusive evidence\u2019 and \u2018evidence that is fully conclusive\u2019), especially when they appear within the same judgment; their relative strength is nonetheless difficult to ascertain.

The ICJ has never specifically rejected such evidence. In the Corfu Channel case the UK submitted evidence acquired, despite Albanian protest, through minesweeping operations in Albanian waters. The Court did not exclude the evidence. The reason may be that Albania did not challenge its admissibility; or it may be the general policy described above, of regarding flaws in the evidence as a factor for weighing it rather than for its exclusion.175\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNJJ3GVR4%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2228%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Ronen, 2020, p. 28</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Yael Ronen", "date": "2020", "journal": null, "title": "Some Evidentiary Dimensions of Attributing Unlawful Cyber Operations to States", "abstract": "This project is part of a larger research initiative to examine the feasibility and advisability of an international attribution mechanism dedicated to hostile cyber operations.
