However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held that a \u201cstate of necessity\u201d can be invoked only under very restrictive circumstances.24\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 435)", "\u201cSince our analysis is restricted to the exercise of the right of self-defense and the use of countermeasures\u2014fundamental aspects of public international law\u2014the most authoritative source among international judicial bodies with regard to standards of proof is the ICJ.66 That Court seems to insist on as much judicial latitude as possible. As a former judge and president of the ICJ states, \u201cThe Court\u2019s prime objective as to standard of proof appears to have been to retain a freedom in evaluating the evidence, relying on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d67 Indeed, the ICJ has not articulated even a general standard of proof to be applied in cases brought before it.68 One plausible explanation for this lack of an articulated standard is that a truly international bench of judges, such as the ICJ, includes lawyers from various legal traditions, including both common law and civil law jurisdictions.69 This inclusivity, in turn, may contribute to a reluctance to make express reference to national concepts of standard of proof, each of which has its own legal history, doctrinal structure, and normative context. In fact, the ICJ restricts itself to drawing \u201cinspiration from both the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and continental systems of civil law.\u201d70\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 443)", "\u201cInternational criminal courts strictly adhere to the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard.64 Other international courts, tribunals, and dispute settlement bodies fluctuate between different standards of proof, often without providing precise definitions of each standard or their scope of application.65\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 442)", "\u201chich the international responsibility of a party is at stake the standard of proof depends on the nature of the international obligation allegedly breached by that party.71 If the obligation breached is of \u201cexceptional gravity,\u201d such as a claim alleging a violation of the prohibition of genocide, the standard of proof is that the \u201cevidence . . . is fully conclusive\u201d and the Court has to be \u201cfully convinced that [the] allegations . . . have been clearly established.\u201d72 Moreover, the Court stated, \u201c[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\u201d73 Some scholars have suggested that the Court is satisfied with a lower standard of proof74 when the claim is that a State \u201chas breached its undertakings to prevent genocide and to punish and extradite persons charged with genocide\u201d75 in requiring \u201cproof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.\u201d76 This argument is not persuasive.77 Still, \u201cappropriate to the seriousness of the allegation\u201d supports the view that the standard of proof applied by the ICJ varies with the seriousness of the alleged breach of international law.78\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 444)", "\u201cAdmittedly, the ICJ seems to apply an intermediate standard of proof in self-defense cases without distinction as to the gravity of the amount of force used by the victim-State.92 While expressly rejecting a \u201cbalance of evidence\u201d test,93 in Oil Platforms, the Court found the evidence presented by the United States \u201cinconclusive\u201d regarding Iran\u2019s responsibility for the naval mine struck by a U.S. warship or the missile attack on a U.S.-reflagged merchant vessel.94 In that same judgment, the Court indicated conclusive evidence constituted evidence that was more than merely \u201csuggestive\u201d or \u201chighly suggestive.\u201d95 This finding is consistent with earlier statements of the Court indicating convincing evidence is the standard of proof to be applied in jus ad bellum cases involving actions taken by military forces.96 Thus, as noted earlier,97 one should hesitate to equate this international standard of proof (convincing evidence) with the national standard of clear and convincing evidence found in common law jurisdictions.98\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 447)", "\u201cIn many, if not most cases, the standard of proof will be convincing evidence, a rather high standard of proof. This standard does not rule out the consideration of indirect evidence.128 Accordingly, depending on its reliability, value, and weight, indirect evidence may be sufficient to meet the convincing evidence standard.129 In Corfu Channel, the ICJ correctly held that \u201cindirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions.\u201d130 The Court further explained that indirect evidence \u201cmust be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.\u201d131 Indirect evidence is of the utmost importance if the conduct that breached an international obligation took place in territory under the exclusive control of the State being held accountable due to the difficulty of collecting evidence. The Court explicitly acknowledged that, \u201c[b]y reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility.\u201d132\u201d (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 454)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FTBBTDB7I%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22434%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B153.02%2C409.351796875%2C485.8519999999998%2C420.358%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C395.911796875%2C486.08200000000005%2C406.918%5D%2C%5B135.02%2C382.351796875%2C485.968%2C393.358%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FJ8QWBVHI%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22434%22%7D%7D\">\u201cCausality, attribution, and evidentiary issues resulting from adverse cyber operations are invariably linked to the legal basis for the potential responses by States affected by the operation (the victim-State).

struck by a U.S. warship or the missile attack on a U.S.-reflagged merchant vessel.94 In that same judgment, the Court indicated conclusive evidence constituted evidence that was more than merely

As a former judge and president of the ICJ states, \u201cThe Court\u2019s prime objective as to standard of proof appears to have been to retain a freedom in evaluating the evidence, relying on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d67 Indeed, the ICJ has not articulated even a general standard of proof to be applied in cases brought before it.68 One plausible explanation for this lack of an articulated standard is that a truly international bench of judges, such as the ICJ, includes lawyers from various legal traditions, including both common law and civil law jurisdictions.69 This inclusivity, in turn, may contribute to a reluctance to make express reference to national concepts of standard of proof, each of which has its own legal history, doctrinal structure, and normative context.
