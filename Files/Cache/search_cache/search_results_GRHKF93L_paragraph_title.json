[T]here is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action.\u201d42\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 195)", "\u201cSome states and nonstate actors use cyber tools to strike with impunity, knowing (or at least strongly suspecting) that their digital attacks will not prompt a response, certainly not a kinetic response. The exfiltration of data and intellectual property has been going on for some time, at great cost to governments and private industry. More recent and increasingly sophisticated forms of offensive hacking are capable of causing more significant harm, even catastrophic damage, such as shutting down financial systems, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and scrambling communications. These activities all place a premium on knowing the source of the cyber intrusion, so that states can respond accordingly.\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 191)", "\u201cStates are likewise not obligated to provide evidence of attribution when responding to another state\u2019s cyber intrusions.43 While the IGE acknowledged the value in such a disclosure requirement, it found insufficient state practice and opinio juris to recognize \u201can established basis under international law for such an obligation.\u201d44 The IGE noted that the highly classified nature of such attribution assessments is the primary reason for the absence of customary international law on this important point.45\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 195)", "\u201cIn a similar vein, the time it takes to produce a high confidence attribution judgment can limit the lawful responses to cyber operations. Mistaken attribution can lead to an unlawful response even if the state made a reasonable attribution judgment and implemented countermeasures.38 If a state victimized by an internationally wrongful cyber intrusion engages in countermeasures and ends up being wrong about state attribution, the victimized state has committed an internationally wrongful act.39 On the other hand, if the victim state waits until it has high confidence in its attribution of a state\u2019s responsibility for the intrusion, any countermeasures may be construed as punishment, a form of reprisal forbidden under international law.40 As a result, cyber deterrence may be undermined because the legally less risky but weak self-help retorsion responses to an intrusion are unlikely to deter similar cyber intrusions in the future.\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 195)", "\u201cYet international law has never had a precise definition of \u201ccoercion.\u201d According to a consensus among the cyber experts who contributed to Tallinn 2.0, \u201ccoercion is not limited to physical force, but rather refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice ... to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\u201d22 A state compels another state by, for example, providing cyber training or supplying malware to a terrorist group operating in the compelled state.23 Yet defining the full range of cyber conduct that qualifies as \u201ccoercion\u201d has been more difficult. The International Group of Experts (IGE) that provided the analysis in Tallinn 2.0 could only agree on the anodyne statement \u201cthat as a general matter, States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.\u201d24 The IGE elaborated: Reasonableness is always context dependent. It depends on such factors as, inter alia, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved. These factors must be considered together. Importantly in the cyber context, deficiencies in technical intelligence may be compensated by, for example, the existence of highly reliable human intelligence.25\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 194)", "\u201cAlthough attribution is necessarily probabilistic, the process serves its purpose if it convinces the responsible state (and victim state\u2019s citizens) that a response to the cyber intrusion is called for.46 The fact that attribution judgments draw on many different sources of information has one major temporal implication\u2014early judgments made with less information are generally less believable than later judgments made with more information. Continuing investigation may reveal additional useful information, which may (or may not) reinforce attribution judgments made earlier. Over time, an international consensus may develop on the minimum level of involvement needed to declare that a state is legally responsible for a cyber operation.\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 196)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FM7PUBMIB%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22193%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.9779%2C513.2483742999999%2C539.9538633799996%2C524.325475%5D%2C%5B72.00080930000001%2C500.20885575999995%2C539.9745914299994%2C511.0832223%5D%2C%5B71.99953715000001%2C487.22637430000003%2C539.99129572%2C498.303475%5D%2C%5B72.00084129999999%2C474.2436743%2C539.96602408%2C485.32115698%5D%2C%5B71.99976988000009%2C461.20415576%2C540.0115999999999%2C472.28125645999995%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22193%22%7D%7D\">\u201cOutside an armed conflict, international law forbids cyber intrusions that violate the prohibition on intervention.18 Based on the international law principle of sovereignty, the principle forbids coercive intervention by cyber means.19 The consensus among experts is that state-on-state cyber intrusions that are not coercive but are \u201cdetrimental, objectionable, or otherwise unfriendly\u201d20 are not international legal violations.

More recent and increasingly sophisticated forms of offensive hacking are capable of causing more significant harm, even catastrophic damage, such as shutting down financial systems, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and scrambling communications.

Drawing from the ILC rules, the starting point in the cyber context is that \u201ca State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\u201d15 In essence, states are responsible for the wrongful cyber-related acts of their own officials, agents, contractors, nonstate actors, and other states, to the extent they actually control the operations.16 States do not escape legal responsibility for internationally wrongful acts by perpetrating them through proxies.17\u201d (Banks, 2019, p. 193)", "\u201cYet international law has never had a precise definition of \u201ccoercion.\u201d According to a consensus among the cyber experts who contributed to Tallinn 2.0, \u201ccoercion is not limited to physical force, but rather refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice ... to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way.\u201d22 A state compels another state by, for example, providing cyber training or supplying malware to a terrorist group operating in the compelled state.23 Yet defining the full range of cyber conduct that qualifies as \u201ccoercion\u201d has been more difficult. The International Group of Experts (IGE) that provided the analysis in Tallinn 2.0 could only agree on the anodyne statement \u201cthat as a general matter, States must act as reasonable States would in the same or similar circumstances when considering responses to them.\u201d24 The IGE elaborated: Reasonableness is always context dependent. It depends on such factors as, inter alia, the reliability, quantum, directness, nature (e.g., technical data, human intelligence), and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved. These factors must be considered together.

States often use technical tools to hide their responsibility and/or rely on nonstate proxies to carry out cyber activities for them.5 However, significant technological strides in attributing cyber events in the last decade have made the task \u201cmore nuanced, more common, and more political than has typically been acknowledged.\u201d6 The nuance involves combining experienced and disciplined technical operators with the intuition and judgment of intelligence professionals. The political aspect includes assessing what is at stake in making the attribution judgment, starting with the damage incurred, whether physical, financial, or reputational.7 As such, attribution is often expressed in degrees of certainty, and it requires input from a range of actors and sources, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and diplomatic relations.8\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22192%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2019, p. 192</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FM7PUBMIB%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22194%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B81.9779%2C353.20437430000004%2C540.0099638899999%2C364.281475%5D%2C%5B71.99970929%2C340.2216743%2C539.9772134499999%2C351.298775%5D%2C%5B71.99995915%2C327.2390743%2C539.9930662399998%2C338.31645698%5D%2C%5B72.0004118%2C314.19955576%2C539.9776660999999%2C325.27665645999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22194%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe IGE opined that \u201cas a general matter the graver the underlying breach ... , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response35 ... because the robustness of permissible selfhelp responses ... grows commensurately with the seriousness of the breach.\u201d36 However, the severity of the cyber intrusion directed at an injured state is also relevant, so that a state confronted with \u201clow-level cyber operations</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FM7PUBMIB%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22195%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72%2C666.2058743%2C539.9706542399998%2C677.2829750000001%5D%2C%5B71.99999999999999%2C653.22355628%2C446.41159999999996%2C664.3006569800001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22195%22%7D%7D\">that are merely disruptive\u201d may be expected to amass more evidence for attribution than a state victimized by \u201cdevastating cyber operations and needing to respond immediately to terminate them.\u201d37\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22195%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2019, p. 195</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "William C Banks", "date": "2019", "journal": "AJIL Unbound", "title": "The Bumpy Road to a Meaningful International Law of Cyber Attribution", "abstract": "Attributing computer network intrusions has grown in importance as cyber penetrations across sovereign borders have become commonplace.

short-term prospects for international legal regulation of cyber attribution are not encouraging. The failure of a state to provide persuasive proof of attribution is not itself an internationally wrongful act. Nor are there burdens of proof or additional legal criteria for establishing attribution. The 2015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) report noted that accusations of wrongful acts by states \u201cshould be substantiated,\u201d41 but the GGE gave no indication of which or how much evidence would suffice or even count. The U.S. view, articulated by State Department Legal Adviser Brian Egan in November 2016, is that \u201ca State acts as its own judge of the facts and may make a unilateral determination with respect to attribution of a cyber operation to another State. ... [T]here is no international legal obligation to reveal evidence on which attribution is based prior to taking appropriate action.\u201d42\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22195%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2019, p. 195</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "William C Banks", "date": "2019", "journal": "AJIL Unbound", "title": "The Bumpy Road to a Meaningful International Law of Cyber Attribution", "abstract": "Attributing computer network intrusions has grown in importance as cyber penetrations across sovereign borders have become commonplace.

The customary law of state responsibility for violations of international law, and with it the law of attribution, is drawn largely from the long-term work of the International Law Commission (ILC) and its Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.14 The ILC rules were commended to the member states by the UN General Assembly in 2001 and have become the authoritative guidepost for public international cyber law. Drawing from the ILC rules, the starting point in the cyber context is that \u201ca State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation.\u201d15 In essence, states are responsible for the wrongful cyber-related acts of their own officials, agents, contractors, nonstate actors, and other states, to the extent they actually control the operations.16 States do not escape legal responsibility for internationally wrongful acts by perpetrating them through proxies.17\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22193%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2019, p. 193</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "William C Banks", "date": "2019", "journal": "AJIL Unbound", "title": "The Bumpy Road to a Meaningful International Law of Cyber Attribution", "abstract": "Attributing computer network intrusions has grown in importance as cyber penetrations across sovereign borders have become commonplace.

The political aspect includes assessing what is at stake in making the attribution judgment, starting with the damage incurred, whether physical, financial, or reputational.7 As such, attribution is often expressed in degrees of certainty, and it requires input from a range of actors and sources, including technical forensics, human intelligence, signals intelligence, history, and diplomatic relations.8\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FGRHKF93L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22192%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Banks, 2019, p. 192</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "William C Banks", "date": "2019", "journal": "AJIL Unbound", "title": "The Bumpy Road to a Meaningful International Law of Cyber Attribution", "abstract": "Attributing computer network intrusions has grown in importance as cyber penetrations across sovereign borders have become commonplace.
