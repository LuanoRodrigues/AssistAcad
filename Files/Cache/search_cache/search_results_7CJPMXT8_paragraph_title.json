There are competing viewpoints.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 4)", "\u201cSecond, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decisions to make\u2014such as whether, when, and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated action from allies. This political decisionmaking is, of course, \u201ca highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.\u201d14 The accusing state may take into account a complex matrix of political pursuits, including: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms. Simply put, a state\u2019s decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 2)", "\u201cFirst, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and describe the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is, in large part, a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber activities back to a machine or a location. Yet pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires intense corroboration from human intelligence as well; it goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law. States\u2019 capabilities in this regard are far from evenly distributed,12 which will inevitably lead to an asymmetric pattern of attribution practices. Empirical data shows that technically capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.13\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 1)", "\u201cThe term \u201cill-substantiated public attribution\u201d refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assign responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. It\u2019s a problem with a moving scale, rather than a simple yes-orno judgment. Around this concept, two illustrating points are necessary.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 2)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWEY6KIP7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%227%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B117%2C656.106%2C558.0648%2C667.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C642.106%2C558.0218999999996%2C653.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C628.106%2C557.979%2C639.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C614.106%2C557.9668999999998%2C625.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C600.106%2C276.64189999999996%2C611.26%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7CJPMXT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIf a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous\u2014or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations\u2014what legal consequences should the accusing state face?

The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is, in large part, a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber activities back to a machine or a location. Yet pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires intense corroboration from human intelligence as well; it goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law. States\u2019 capabilities in this regard are far from evenly distributed,12 which will inevitably lead to an asymmetric pattern of attribution practices. Empirical data shows that technically capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.13\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7CJPMXT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Yang, 2022, p. 1</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FWEY6KIP7%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%222%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B117%2C152.106%2C557.9657999999997%2C163.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C138.106%2C558.0229999999996%2C149.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C124.106%2C558.0065000000002%2C135.26%5D%2C%5B117%2C110.106%2C422.39849999999996%2C121.26%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7CJPMXT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe term \u201cill-substantiated public attribution\u201d refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assign responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence.

They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, but most cyber public attribution cases won\u2019t ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and quality of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, \u201cEven if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.\u201d42\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 6)", "\u201cGeneral international law has not developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence.

Extant cases that adopt the \u201cpreponderance standard\u201d are mostly regarding territory disputes, which rarely involve state responsibility.40 From these premises, two deductions can be safely made. First, the adequate level of evidence for cyber public attribution should lie around the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. Second, in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking can be a proper guideline.41\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 6)", "\u201cThe term \u201cill-substantiated public attribution\u201d refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assign responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. It\u2019s a problem with a moving scale, rather than a simple yes-orno judgment. Around this concept, two illustrating points are necessary.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 2)", "\u201cIn a combined norm on the rules of attribution, evidentiary requirements and legal consequences of erroneous attribution could be termed as: 1. A state cannot be held responsible under international law solely because a problematic ICT activity was launched or otherwise originated from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. 2. A state should substantiate its public attribution with an adequate level of evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a clear and convincing case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. 3. A state should refrain from taking responsive measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making an erroneous or falsified attribution.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 8)", "\u201cState responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.21 Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution. The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3. Legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attributions are not clearly defined.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 4)", "\u201cSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.19 The United States and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can, thereby, \u201cact reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d20\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 3)", "\u201cThis proposal is not a suitable solution for two reasons.27 First, both the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the non-state actor\u2014thus, they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control.

A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, it must be proven that the original cyber operation stems from within the territorial state; that it causes serious, adverse consequences about which the territorial state has actual or constructive knowledge; and that the territorial state can but fails to take all feasible measures.

Linking state organs\u2019 activity to that state, per ARSIWA stipulations, proves to be less troublesome; it\u2019s a different story when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors. Unfortunately, most of the situations that concern cyber attribution are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate actor\u2019s behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial.

A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, it must be proven that the original cyber operation stems from within the territorial state; that it causes serious, adverse consequences about which the territorial state has actual or constructive knowledge; and that the territorial state can but fails to take all feasible measures. Moreover, the original cyber operation must constitute a breach of international obligation should it be conducted by the territorial state.32\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2F7CJPMXT8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Yang, 2022, p. 5</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Fan Yang", "date": "2022", "journal": null, "title": "The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Cyber Attribution: A Legal Perspective - Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution", "abstract": "Compared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it\u2019s only logical that public attribution should be better supported.

The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3. Legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attributions are not clearly defined.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 4)", "\u201cIn a combined norm on the rules of attribution, evidentiary requirements and legal consequences of erroneous attribution could be termed as: 1. A state cannot be held responsible under international law solely because a problematic ICT activity was launched or otherwise originated from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. 2. A state should substantiate its public attribution with an adequate level of evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a clear and convincing case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. 3. A state should refrain from taking responsive measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making an erroneous or falsified attribution.\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 8)", "\u201cSecond, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.19 The United States and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can, thereby, \u201cact reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d20\u201d (Yang, 2022, p. 3)", "\u201cIf the accusing state argues that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith, could claims of \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201chonesty\u201d exonerate its false judgment? Positive view is echoed by some scholarly papers,44 as well as official statements.45 For example, the Tallinn Manual explicitly asserts that \u201cthe exercise of the right of self-defense . . . is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made ex ante, not ex post facto.

The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3.

The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3.

Linking state organs\u2019 activity to that state, per ARSIWA stipulations, proves to be less troublesome; it\u2019s a different story when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors. Unfortunately, most of the situations that concern cyber attribution are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate actor\u2019s behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial.

The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3.

Linking state organs\u2019 activity to that state, per ARSIWA stipulations, proves to be less troublesome; it\u2019s a different story when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors. Unfortunately, most of the situations that concern cyber attribution are in the latter camp.
