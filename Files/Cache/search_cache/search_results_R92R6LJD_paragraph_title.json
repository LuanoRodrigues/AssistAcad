The problem is then...the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator.66\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22113%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 113</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2299%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A25%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B100%2C327.40310453125%2C480.7265000000002%2C333.49536%5D%2C%5B100%2C309.25310453125%2C503.75280000000015%2C315.34536%5D%2C%5B100%2C291.10310453125%2C486.2731400000002%2C297.19536%5D%2C%5B100%2C272.95310453125%2C494.06917000000004%2C279.04536%5D%2C%5B100%2C254.80310453125003%2C511.24831000000006%2C267.5771978000001%5D%2C%5B100%2C236.65310453125002%2C493.6977000000003%2C242.74536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C218.50310453125002%2C510.02346000000006%2C224.59536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C200.35310453125%2C267.3835702%2C213.1271978%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2299%22%7D%7D\">\u201cArguments have also been made that individuals could even be responsible under international law for cyber \u201cwar crimes.\u201d For example, Fidler has argued that the videos showing the killing of human beings by the Islamic State are themselves violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and constitute war crimes.41 Under the Rome Statute (which establishes the International Criminal Court and gives it jurisdiction over individuals charged with war crimes), Fidler argues that \u201cthose making and posting the Islamic State\u2019s videos are criminally accountable\u201d under IHL.42\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2299%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 99</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Herbert Lin", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts", "abstract": "Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

Mandiant was also able to develop profiles (\u201cpersonas\u201d) on several individuals within APT1, though it was not able to determine with any certainty their real names or identities.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 90)", "\u201cIdentifying a particular nation-state as the party ultimately responsible for a cyber intrusion hinges on what it means to be \u201cresponsible.\u201d A variety of different forms of state responsibility can be imagined. The following hierarchy of national involvement as it corresponds to responsibility is largely based on Jason Healey\u2019s taxonomy in \u201cBeyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\u201d32 \u2022 A state could be incapable of detecting hacking activities within its borders.33 \u2022 A state could prohibit hacking activities (defined here as conducting cyber intrusions of various kinds), but have no ability to enforce this prohibition against third-party actors. \u2022 A state could tolerate hacking activities. States could decide not to outlaw these actions, or not to prosecute those who launch attacks. \u2022 A state could encourage hacking activities. In this scenario, a state may provide under-the-table support (intelligence, operational guidance, or \u201csuggestions\u201d), or simply promote a culture whereby these actions are lauded. \u2022 A state could direct hacking activities. For example, a state could ask organizations within its jurisdictional reach or contract with non-state organizations to conduct specific hacking activities. \u2022 A state could conduct hacking activities. A state uses its military or intelligence assets to conduct offensive cyber operations, perhaps integrated with third-party hackers.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 97)", "\u201cIn principle, it is also possible for A to use \u201cloud\u201d cyber weapons that self-attribute, much like nationality markings on aircraft assert that an airplane using the U.S. nationality marking is in fact a U.S. military airplane and national uniforms worn by soldiers assert that a soldier wearing a U.S. military uniform is in fact a member of the U.S. armed forces. But even if such cyber weapons are used (and U.S. Cyber Command has expressed an interest in obtaining such weapons), B might still have to go through the process of determining A was indeed responsible, even if the weapon was eminently traceable to A.94 (The technical challenge for self-attributing cyber weapons is two-fold. First, the self-attributing characteristic must not enable an adversary\u2019s defenses to identify the weapon as hostile before it acts. Second, the self-attributing characteristic must not be usable by another Nation C.)\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 128)", "\u201cThe Budapest Convention, also known as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, is an international agreement that seeks to harmonize national laws explicating offenses that constitute cyber crimes, to improve national capabilities for investigating such crimes, and to increase international cooperation among the signatories on investigations.31 The convention\u2019s provisions on cooperation are a rough substitute for pairs of signatory nations that do not have a MLAT in place, but existing MLATs between other pairs of nations supersede the convention\u2019s provisions. Increased international cooperation on investigations may well increase the amount and quality of useful information available for attribution judgments.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 96)", "\u201cIn addition to the Mandiant APT1 report described above, some other examples of private-sector involvement in attribution include:57 \u2022 FireEye\u2019s report, \u201cAPT28 - A Window Into Russia\u2019s Cyber Espionage Operations,\u201d indicating Russian involvement in a variety of espionage activities against private-sector and government actors.58 \u2022 Novetta\u2019s report, \u201cOperation SNM: Axiom Threat Actor Group Report,\u201d indicating Chinese government involvement in cyber espionage against a variety of private companies, governments, journalists, and pro-democracy groups.59 \u2022 CrowdStrike\u2019s report, \u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence Report: Putter Panda,\u201d identifying Unit 61486 in the Chinese PLA as responsible for the cyber-enabled theft of corporate trade secrets primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace, and communication industries.60\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 107)", "\u201cAt least two noteworthy proposals for an attribution court have surfaced in the past few years. In 2012, the Atlantic Council proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) that would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d In June 2016, Microsoft advanced a similar proposal for an international nongovernmental body that could weigh in credibly on attribution judgments for cyber attacks that exceeded a certain threshold of consequence.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 119)", "\u201cIn 2015, the DOD Cyber Strategy stated that attribution is a \u201cfundamental part of an effective cyber deterrence strategy as anonymity enables malicious cyber activity by state and non-state groups. On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 106</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Herbert Lin", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts", "abstract": "Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

Mandiant was also able to develop profiles (\u201cpersonas\u201d) on several individuals within APT1, though it was not able to determine with any certainty their real names or identities.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 90)", "\u201cIdentifying a particular nation-state as the party ultimately responsible for a cyber intrusion hinges on what it means to be \u201cresponsible.\u201d A variety of different forms of state responsibility can be imagined.

States could decide not to outlaw these actions, or not to prosecute those who launch attacks. \u2022 A state could encourage hacking activities. In this scenario, a state may provide under-the-table support (intelligence, operational guidance, or \u201csuggestions\u201d), or simply promote a culture whereby these actions are lauded. \u2022 A state could direct hacking activities. For example, a state could ask organizations within its jurisdictional reach or contract with non-state organizations to conduct specific hacking activities. \u2022 A state could conduct hacking activities. A state uses its military or intelligence assets to conduct offensive cyber operations, perhaps integrated with third-party hackers.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 97)", "\u201cIn principle, it is also possible for A to use \u201cloud\u201d cyber weapons that self-attribute, much like nationality markings on aircraft assert that an airplane using the U.S. nationality marking is in fact a U.S. military airplane and national uniforms worn by soldiers assert that a soldier wearing a U.S. military uniform is in fact a member of the U.S. armed forces. But even if such cyber weapons are used (and U.S. Cyber Command has expressed an interest in obtaining such weapons), B might still have to go through the process of determining A was indeed responsible, even if the weapon was eminently traceable to A.94 (The technical challenge for self-attributing cyber weapons is two-fold. First, the self-attributing characteristic must not enable an adversary\u2019s defenses to identify the weapon as hostile before it acts. Second, the self-attributing characteristic must not be usable by another Nation C.)\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 128)", "\u201cThe Budapest Convention, also known as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, is an international agreement that seeks to harmonize national laws explicating offenses that constitute cyber crimes, to improve national capabilities for investigating such crimes, and to increase international cooperation among the signatories on investigations.31 The convention\u2019s provisions on cooperation are a rough substitute for pairs of signatory nations that do not have a MLAT in place, but existing MLATs between other pairs of nations supersede the convention\u2019s provisions. Increased international cooperation on investigations may well increase the amount and quality of useful information available for attribution judgments.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 96)", "\u201cIn addition to the Mandiant APT1 report described above, some other examples of private-sector involvement in attribution include:57 \u2022 FireEye\u2019s report, \u201cAPT28 - A Window Into Russia\u2019s Cyber Espionage Operations,\u201d indicating Russian involvement in a variety of espionage activities against private-sector and government actors.58 \u2022 Novetta\u2019s report, \u201cOperation SNM: Axiom Threat Actor Group Report,\u201d indicating Chinese government involvement in cyber espionage against a variety of private companies, governments, journalists, and pro-democracy groups.59 \u2022 CrowdStrike\u2019s report, \u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence Report: Putter Panda,\u201d identifying Unit 61486 in the Chinese PLA as responsible for the cyber-enabled theft of corporate trade secrets primarily relating to the satellite, aerospace, and communication industries.60\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 107)", "\u201cAt least two noteworthy proposals for an attribution court have surfaced in the past few years. In 2012, the Atlantic Council proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) that would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d In June 2016, Microsoft advanced a similar proposal for an international nongovernmental body that could weigh in credibly on attribution judgments for cyber attacks that exceeded a certain threshold of consequence.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 119)", "\u201cIn 2015, the DOD Cyber Strategy stated that attribution is a \u201cfundamental part of an effective cyber deterrence strategy as anonymity enables malicious cyber activity by state and non-state groups. On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 106)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B100%2C236.65310453125002%2C491.35635000000013%2C242.74536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C218.50310453125002%2C509.53902000000005%2C224.59536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C200.35310453125%2C503.8435500000001%2C206.44536000000002%5D%2C%5B100%2C182.20310453125%2C505.09227%2C194.97719780000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C164.05310453125003%2C493.78966000000014%2C170.14536000000004%5D%2C%5B100%2C145.90310453125002%2C507.11055000000016%2C151.99536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C127.75310453125002%2C456.1610800000003%2C133.84536000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn 2013, Mandiant released a report called \u201cAPT1: Exposing One of China\u2019s Cyber Espionage Units,\u201d identifying a group it called \u201cAPT1\u201d as a single organization of operators that conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims between 2006 and 2013.23 Mandiant concluded that APT1 was most likely sponsored by the Chinese government.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 106</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Herbert Lin", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts", "abstract": "Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

The following hierarchy of national involvement as it corresponds to responsibility is largely based on Jason Healey\u2019s taxonomy in \u201cBeyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks.\u201d32 \u2022 A state could be incapable of detecting hacking activities within its borders.33 \u2022 A state could prohibit hacking activities (defined here as conducting cyber intrusions of various kinds), but have no ability to enforce this prohibition against third-party actors. \u2022 A state could tolerate hacking activities. States could decide not to outlaw these actions, or not to prosecute those who launch attacks. \u2022 A state could encourage hacking activities. In this scenario, a state may provide under-the-table support (intelligence, operational guidance, or \u201csuggestions\u201d), or simply promote a culture whereby these actions are lauded. \u2022 A state could direct hacking activities. For example, a state could ask organizations within its jurisdictional reach or contract with non-state organizations to conduct specific hacking activities. \u2022 A state could conduct hacking activities. A state uses its military or intelligence assets to conduct offensive cyber operations, perhaps integrated with third-party hackers.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 97)", "\u201cIn principle, it is also possible for A to use \u201cloud\u201d cyber weapons that self-attribute, much like nationality markings on aircraft assert that an airplane using the U.S. nationality marking is in fact a U.S. military airplane and national uniforms worn by soldiers assert that a soldier wearing a U.S. military uniform is in fact a member of the U.S. armed forces. But even if such cyber weapons are used (and U.S. Cyber Command has expressed an interest in obtaining such weapons), B might still have to go through the process of determining A was indeed responsible, even if the weapon was eminently traceable to A.94 (The technical challenge for self-attributing cyber weapons is two-fold. First, the self-attributing characteristic must not enable an adversary\u2019s defenses to identify the weapon as hostile before it acts. Second, the self-attributing characteristic must not be usable by another Nation C.)\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 128)", "\u201cThe Budapest Convention, also known as the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, is an international agreement that seeks to harmonize national laws explicating offenses that constitute cyber crimes, to improve national capabilities for investigating such crimes, and to increase international cooperation among the signatories on investigations.31 The convention\u2019s provisions on cooperation are a rough substitute for pairs of signatory nations that do not have a MLAT in place, but existing MLATs between other pairs of nations supersede the convention\u2019s provisions.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 106</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Herbert Lin", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts", "abstract": "Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

But even if such cyber weapons are used (and U.S. Cyber Command has expressed an interest in obtaining such weapons), B might still have to go through the process of determining A was indeed responsible, even if the weapon was eminently traceable to A.94 (The technical challenge for self-attributing cyber weapons is two-fold.

In 2012, the Atlantic Council proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) that would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d In June 2016, Microsoft advanced a similar proposal for an international nongovernmental body that could weigh in credibly on attribution judgments for cyber attacks that exceeded a certain threshold of consequence.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 119)", "\u201cIn 2015, the DOD Cyber Strategy stated that attribution is a \u201cfundamental part of an effective cyber deterrence strategy as anonymity enables malicious cyber activity by state and non-state groups. On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 106)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2290%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A16%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B100%2C236.65310453125002%2C491.35635000000013%2C242.74536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C218.50310453125002%2C509.53902000000005%2C224.59536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C200.35310453125%2C503.8435500000001%2C206.44536000000002%5D%2C%5B100%2C182.20310453125%2C505.09227%2C194.97719780000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C164.05310453125003%2C493.78966000000014%2C170.14536000000004%5D%2C%5B100%2C145.90310453125002%2C507.11055000000016%2C151.99536000000003%5D%2C%5B100%2C127.75310453125002%2C456.1610800000003%2C133.84536000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2290%22%7D%7D\">\u201cIn 2013, Mandiant released a report called \u201cAPT1: Exposing One of China\u2019s Cyber Espionage Units,\u201d identifying a group it called \u201cAPT1\u201d as a single organization of operators that conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims between 2006 and 2013.23 Mandiant concluded that APT1 was most likely sponsored by the Chinese government.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 106</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Herbert Lin", "date": "2016", "journal": "Journal of International Affairs", "title": "Attribution of Malicious Cyber Incidents: From Soup to Nuts", "abstract": "Attribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

First of all, there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them.... Thirdly, there is the secrecy in which some of the conduct attributed to one or other of the Parties has been carried on. This makes it more difficult for the Court not only to decide on the imputability of the facts, but also to establish what are the facts (emphasis added). Sometimes there is no question...that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it.

First of all, there is marked disagreement between the Parties not only on the interpretation of the facts, but even on the existence or nature of at least some of them.... Thirdly, there is the secrecy in which some of the conduct attributed to one or other of the Parties has been carried on. This makes it more difficult for the Court not only to decide on the imputability of the facts, but also to establish what are the facts (emphasis added). Sometimes there is no question...that an act was done, but there are conflicting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 106)", "\u201cattribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue, about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance. Attribution has many aspects, and a variety of well-researched and well-executed papers cover one or more of these aspects; these papers are referenced in the body of the paper and are called out again in the acknowledgements section. This paper tries to synthesize the best aspects of these works with some original thoughts of the author\u2019s own into a coherent picture of how attribution works, why it is both important and difficult, and how the entire process relates to policymaking.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 76)", "\u201cAttribution is a key element of taking responsive action, but attribution and responsive action are not independent variables.

Efforts to improve technical forensics are also underway. A contemporary example is the DARPA Enhanced Attribution Program (Box 1).:In April 2016, DARPA announced a solicitation for proposals related to enhanced attribution. The announced program aims to make currently opaque malicious cyber adversary actions and individual cyber operator attribution transparent by providing high-fidelity visibility into all aspects of malicious cyber operator actions and to increase the government\u2019s ability to publicly reveal the actions of individual malicious cyber operators without damaging sources and methods. The program will develop techniques and tools for generating operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent independent malicious cyber campaigns, each involving several operators, and the means to share such information with any of a number of interested parties (e.g., as part of a response option). The program seeks to develop: \u2022 technologies to extract behavioral and physical biometrics from a range of devices and vantage points to consistently identify virtual personas and individual malicious cyber operators over time and across different endpoint devices and C2 infrastructures; \u2022 techniques to decompose the software tools and actions of malicious cyber operators into semantically rich and compressed knowledge representations; \u2022 scalable techniques to fuse, manage, and project such ground-truth information over time, toward developing a full historical and current picture of malicious activity; \u2022 algorithms for developing predictive behavioral profiles within the context of cyber campaigns; and \u2022 technologies for validating and perhaps enriching this knowledge base with other sources of data, including public and commercial sources of information.

A honeypot is in essence a decoy, configured to look attractive to an intruder but instrumented so that the intruder\u2019s behavior can be clandestinely observed and monitored. If and when the same intruder returns to the targeted installation, his behavior can be recognized more easily.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 83)", "\u201cThe center of gravity of informed judgment seems to indicate greater overall confidence in attribution today compared to a decade ago, but the future remains cloudy as intruders and attributers advance their respective capabilities. Regardless of how these competing factors compare in the future, a number of fundamental propositions will remain. To be successful, attribution will always entail an all-source proposition, and technical forensics will be only one part of an attribution judgment. Attribution judgments will always have some degree of uncertainty associated with them, and the significance of such uncertainty is a political and policy matter rather than a technical one. Victims will have to live with the possibility that they will not be able to arrive at accurate attribution judgments with high confidence, and adversaries will have to live with the possibility that their victims will be able to attribute their malicious cyber activities to them.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 129)", "\u201cAt least two noteworthy proposals for an attribution court have surfaced in the past few years. In 2012, the Atlantic Council proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC) that would \u201cprovide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.\u201d In June 2016, Microsoft advanced a similar proposal for an international nongovernmental body that could weigh in credibly on attribution judgments for cyber attacks that exceeded a certain threshold of consequence.\u201d (Lin, 2016, p. 119)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22123%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A49%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B100%2C714.60310453125%2C502.74454000000003%2C720.6953599999999%5D%2C%5B100%2C696.20496%2C504.7275100000001%2C707.36116%5D%2C%5B100%2C678.30310453125%2C503.6544600000001%2C684.39536%5D%2C%5B100%2C660.15310453125%2C508.49963000000025%2C666.24536%5D%2C%5B100%2C642.0031045312501%2C505.6210400000002%2C648.09536%5D%2C%5B100%2C623.85310453125%2C298.96875020000004%2C636.6271978%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22123%22%7D%7D\">\u201cNote also that responses even to an armed attack may not entail the use of military force.

On matters of intelligence, attribution, and warning, DOD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to unmask an actor\u2019s cyber persona, identify the attack\u2019s point of origin, and determine tactics, techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.\u201d The 2015 articulation is thus more measured and moderate in tone than Panetta\u2019s comments of 2012.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 106</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2276%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B131.54294%2C714.60310453125%2C495.60059%2C720.6953599999999%5D%2C%5B131.54294%2C696.45310453125%2C485.3892900000002%2C702.54536%5D%2C%5B100%2C678.30310453125%2C502.20037000000013%2C684.39536%5D%2C%5B100%2C660.15310453125%2C501.52882000000034%2C666.24536%5D%2C%5B100%2C642.0031045312501%2C509.79301000000004%2C648.09536%5D%2C%5B100%2C623.85310453125%2C502.4048600000002%2C629.9453599999999%5D%2C%5B100%2C605.70310453125%2C500.5354100000003%2C611.79536%5D%2C%5B100%2C587.55310453125%2C429.71653000000015%2C593.64536%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2276%22%7D%7D\">\u201cattribution of malicious cyber activities is a deep issue, about which confusion and disquiet can be found in abundance.

The announced program aims to make currently opaque malicious cyber adversary actions and individual cyber operator attribution transparent by providing high-fidelity visibility into all aspects of malicious cyber operator actions and to increase the government\u2019s ability to publicly reveal the actions of individual malicious cyber operators without damaging sources and methods. The program will develop techniques and tools for generating operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent independent malicious cyber campaigns, each involving several operators, and the means to share such information with any of a number of interested parties (e.g., as part of a response option). The program seeks to develop: \u2022 technologies to extract behavioral and physical biometrics from a range of devices and vantage points to consistently identify virtual personas and individual malicious cyber operators over time and across different endpoint devices and C2 infrastructures; \u2022 techniques to decompose the software tools and actions of malicious cyber operators into semantically rich and compressed knowledge representations; \u2022 scalable techniques to fuse, manage, and project such ground-truth information over time, toward developing a full historical and current picture of malicious activity; \u2022 algorithms for developing predictive behavioral profiles within the context of cyber campaigns; and \u2022 technologies for validating and perhaps enriching this knowledge base with other sources of data, including public and commercial sources of information.

Regardless of how these competing factors compare in the future, a number of fundamental propositions will remain. To be successful, attribution will always entail an all-source proposition, and technical forensics will be only one part of an attribution judgment. Attribution judgments will always have some degree of uncertainty associated with them, and the significance of such uncertainty is a political and policy matter rather than a technical one. Victims will have to live with the possibility that they will not be able to arrive at accurate attribution judgments with high confidence, and adversaries will have to live with the possibility that their victims will be able to attribute their malicious cyber activities to them.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22129%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Lin, 2016, p. 129</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FV4EQSF55%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22119%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A45%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.82000000000001%2C687.37907046875%2C480.6968000000003%2C697.34709%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C675.27907046875%2C495.7625100000001%2C685.24709%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C663.17907046875%2C492.02427%2C673.1470899999999%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C651.07907046875%2C499.6586000000001%2C661.04709%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C638.97907046875%2C494.2026%2C648.94709%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C626.87907046875%2C496.4279000000004%2C636.84709%5D%2C%5B106.82000000000001%2C614.77907046875%2C487.28910000000025%2C624.74709%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FR92R6LJD%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22119%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAt least two noteworthy proposals for an attribution court have surfaced in the past few years.
