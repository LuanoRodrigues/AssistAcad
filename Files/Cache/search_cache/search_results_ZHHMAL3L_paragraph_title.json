The political, non-military national strategies and concepts of cyberspace are the first indicators suggesting the state\u2019s approach and behaviour in the cyber environment. Even more telling is the study of the military doctrines of the state, as they may indicate whether the state has inclinations toward building and using offensive cyber weapons or employing cyber-attacks as a force multiplier alongside conventional warfare.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cA similar logic can be observed in regard to the second category of indirect proof \u2013 the level of preparedness. A number of different types of cyber-attacks require time for situation mapping, reconnaissance and implementation so that they reach the necessary sophistication and maximum psychological effect. For instance, the right offensive graphics or collage of pictures posted on a defaced ministerial website may cause not only a denial of information to citizens, but also an offensive effect targeting the citizens\u2019 psychology. To reach a certain level of sophistication in this respect, the perpetrators would need to receive intelligence from a state source and plan such cyber-attacks well in advance.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cThe cyber-attacks on Georgia during the Russian-Georgian conflict in the summer of 2008 most probably contributed to the current widespread trend of tagging cyberspace the \u201cfifth domain\u201d of military combat alongside land, sea, air, and space. However, unlike in the cases of these four historically codified domains, a suitable international legal regime of cyberspace which would regulate it and include both jus ad bellum and jus in bello has appeared to be elusive so far, notably regarding the crucial issues of attribution and state responsibility. Modern technological advancement and its subsequent use in practice raises a range of international relations and legal concerns. For instance, cyber warfare deeply challenges the nature and understanding of the traditional perception of warfare. The attribution of a kinetic attack launched through conventional weaponry is obviously much easier to determine than the identity of a perpetrator of a cyber-attack. Alternatively, the transnational character of cyber-attacks leads to questioning of the current treaty framework, which is helpful but not sufficient since it does not properly cover issues such as state responsibility and sovereignty in cyberspace. The problems regarding defence against or launching of a cyber-assault are numerous, but the most fundamental issues are associated with attribution of these attacks and state responsibility for them. Although it can be technically possible to trace the geographical location of the attacker and so attribute the attack to some extent, it is difficult to actually determine who was sitting in front of the computer screen in the moment when the attack was launched; it could be a state representative, a group of hackers or an individual. Therefore, one of the critical challenges to the international relations and legal systems is keeping up with technological development.3\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37)", "\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law. Yet, many international actors do not hesitate to attribute responsibility in political terms, and with political consequences. It is clear that key actors in international law and international relations understand the issue of attribution in different ways \u2013 international law perceives it through the work of international courts of justice and lawyers who apply binding international legal rules while international relations are based on the (oftentimes rather pragmatic) behaviour of governments and international organisations, and the work of politicians, journalists or, for example, activists. They have different understandings of what is viable and legitimate in their fields. There are various methods which define states\u2019 behaviour within international relations which, however, might not be necessarily supported by international legal norms. On the other hand, states oftentimes acknowledge international legal governance, but their reaction is political in the end. In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)", "\u201cThis section analyses the cyber-warfare in the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008 and distils four different categories of indirect evidence from it. The analysis works mainly with secondary sources, such as publications from Project Grey Goose and other publications by recognised cyber experts (e.g. Dmitri Alperovitch [2009], Jeffrey Carr [2008], Jart Armin [2008a, 2008b], Eneken Tikk [et al. 2008] or Ronald Deibert, Rafal Rohozinski and Masashi Crete-Nishihata [2012]). The following analysis will begin with an introduction to the political and security background to the Russian-Georgian conflict in cyber-space in 2008. Later on, this section will introduce four different types of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cThe dispute between Georgia and Russia was not, however, limited only to operations in the air, on the ground, and at sea. It was the first time that an international political and military conflict was accompanied by orchestrated cyber-attacks of such a scale.6 Georgian websites became a target of the first cyber-attacks several weeks before the actual operation on the ground began. The most serious assault preceding the war took place on 19 July 2008, when the website of President Saakashvili was unavailable for 24 hours. This was caused by a heavy distributed denial of service7 attack (Tikk et al. 2008: 36). The peak of the attacks in cyberspace took place in the week beginning on 8 August, coinciding with the rise of military operations on the Russian-Georgian borders. The cyber-attacks became well-orchestrated and coordinated with the development on the ground by that time. The last serious cyber-attack against Georgia\u2019s websites was registered on 27 August, only a couple of days after the peace agreement was signed.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cThe analysis provides the reader with a categorisation of indirect evidence which, however, has a limited impact. This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types. Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic. Future research might also focus on other major cases of cyber-attacks \u2013 for example, the 2010 Stuxnet worm used against the Iranian nuclear programme, and the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids, which can both potentially offer further indirect evidence for related studies.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cThe cyber operations during the Russian-Georgian conflict in August 2008 might initially appear to be a strategically unimportant example of an attack in cyberspace that was overshadowed by the military campaign on the ground. The kinetic military operations lasted five days and were characterised by conventional warfare that was constrained by the limited communication environment. However, cyber-attacks on Georgian websites played a crucial \u201cif not decisive\u201d role in the overall campaign (Deibert Rohozinski \u2013 Crete-Nishihata 2012: 4), as control of cyberspace quickly became a strategic advantage in the conflict. Security experts immediately became concerned about the identities of the perpetrators of the cyber-attacks on Georgia. Although the Kremlin has never acknowledged any involvement of Russia in activities against Georgia in cyberspace in August 2008, a number of state representatives and cyber experts, together with most of the media, either directly or indirectly pointed their fingers at the Russian government in connection with this matter.1 On what basis could these actors claim what they claim?\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 35)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2243%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6139%2C302.3302999999999%2C445.74389999999966%2C311.0902999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C291.24529999999993%2C445.75090000000023%2C300.0052999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C280.16029999999995%2C445.73389999999966%2C288.92029999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C269.07529999999997%2C445.7628999999989%2C277.83529999999996%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C257.9903%2C445.72889999999984%2C266.7503%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C246.90529999999995%2C399.3628999999998%2C255.66529999999997%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%7D%7D\">\u201cFinally, the fourth category of indirect proof is the state conception of cyber security.

Therefore, one of the critical challenges to the international relations and legal systems is keeping up with technological development.3\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61349999999999%2C154.13920000000002%2C445.74049999999966%2C162.89920000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C142.95620000000002%2C445.74550000000016%2C151.71620000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C131.77320000000003%2C445.7584999999993%2C140.53320000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C120.59020000000004%2C445.7424999999995%2C129.35020000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C109.40720000000005%2C445.7384999999992%2C118.16720000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C98.22420000000005%2C445.6924999999992%2C106.98420000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C87.04120000000006%2C445.75649999999956%2C95.80120000000007%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law.

They have different understandings of what is viable and legitimate in their fields. There are various methods which define states\u2019 behaviour within international relations which, however, might not be necessarily supported by international legal norms. On the other hand, states oftentimes acknowledge international legal governance, but their reaction is political in the end. In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2238%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C511.2646%2C454.23109999999986%2C520.0246%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C500.1276%2C454.2440999999996%2C508.88759999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C488.9906%2C454.19509999999946%2C497.75059999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C477.8536%2C454.21510000000023%2C486.61359999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C466.71659999999997%2C454.22109999999975%2C475.47659999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C455.57959999999997%2C454.22709999999967%2C464.33959999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C444.44259999999997%2C454.2500999999996%2C453.20259999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C433.30559999999997%2C454.23809999999884%2C442.06559999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C422.16859999999997%2C394.54709999999966%2C430.92859999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis section analyses the cyber-warfare in the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008 and distils four different categories of indirect evidence from it.

It was the first time that an international political and military conflict was accompanied by orchestrated cyber-attacks of such a scale.6 Georgian websites became a target of the first cyber-attacks several weeks before the actual operation on the ground began. The most serious assault preceding the war took place on 19 July 2008, when the website of President Saakashvili was unavailable for 24 hours. This was caused by a heavy distributed denial of service7 attack (Tikk et al. 2008: 36). The peak of the attacks in cyberspace took place in the week beginning on 8 August, coinciding with the rise of military operations on the Russian-Georgian borders. The cyber-attacks became well-orchestrated and coordinated with the development on the ground by that time. The last serious cyber-attack against Georgia\u2019s websites was registered on 27 August, only a couple of days after the peace agreement was signed.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2243%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6139%2C235.82029999999995%2C445.73490000000055%2C244.58029999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C224.73529999999994%2C445.74590000000046%2C233.49529999999996%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C213.65029999999993%2C445.75189999999947%2C222.41029999999995%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C202.56529999999992%2C445.7458999999997%2C211.32529999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C191.48029999999991%2C445.72889999999967%2C200.24029999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C180.3952999999999%2C445.73889999999966%2C189.15529999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C169.3102999999999%2C445.72389999999984%2C178.07029999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C158.2252999999999%2C445.7288999999996%2C166.9852999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C147.14029999999988%2C445.729899999999%2C155.9002999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C136.05529999999987%2C232.93290000000002%2C144.8152999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe analysis provides the reader with a categorisation of indirect evidence which, however, has a limited impact. This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types. Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic. Future research might also focus on other major cases of cyber-attacks \u2013 for example, the 2010 Stuxnet worm used against the Iranian nuclear programme, and the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids, which can both potentially offer further indirect evidence for related studies.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6142%2C310.6959%2C445.6911999999998%2C319.4559%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C299.5129%2C445.7651999999998%2C308.2729%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C288.3299%2C445.7262000000002%2C297.0899%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C277.1469%2C445.6932000000001%2C285.9069%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C265.9639%2C445.7212000000003%2C274.7239%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C254.7809%2C445.71819999999906%2C263.5409%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C243.5979%2C445.7311999999999%2C252.35790000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C232.41490000000002%2C445.76320000000044%2C241.17490000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C221.23190000000002%2C445.7381999999997%2C229.99190000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C210.04890000000003%2C445.7051999999998%2C218.80890000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C198.86590000000004%2C445.7301999999997%2C207.62590000000006%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C187.68290000000005%2C445.74719999999957%2C196.44290000000007%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000005%2C176.49990000000005%2C445.7084999999997%2C185.9823%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C165.3222%2C134.0725%2C174.08220000000003%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe cyber operations during the Russian-Georgian conflict in August 2008 might initially appear to be a strategically unimportant example of an attack in cyberspace that was overshadowed by the military campaign on the ground. The kinetic military operations lasted five days and were characterised by conventional warfare that was constrained by the limited communication environment. However, cyber-attacks on Georgian websites played a crucial \u201cif not decisive\u201d role in the overall campaign (Deibert Rohozinski \u2013 Crete-Nishihata 2012: 4), as control of cyberspace quickly became a strategic advantage in the conflict. Security experts immediately became concerned about the identities of the perpetrators of the cyber-attacks on Georgia. Although the Kremlin has never acknowledged any involvement of Russia in activities against Georgia in cyberspace in August 2008, a number of state representatives and cyber experts, together with most of the media, either directly or indirectly pointed their fingers at the Russian government in connection with this matter.1 On what basis could these actors claim what they claim?\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 35</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain.

Yet, many international actors do not hesitate to attribute responsibility in political terms, and with political consequences. It is clear that key actors in international law and international relations understand the issue of attribution in different ways \u2013 international law perceives it through the work of international courts of justice and lawyers who apply binding international legal rules while international relations are based on the (oftentimes rather pragmatic) behaviour of governments and international organisations, and the work of politicians, journalists or, for example, activists. They have different understandings of what is viable and legitimate in their fields. There are various methods which define states\u2019 behaviour within international relations which, however, might not be necessarily supported by international legal norms. On the other hand, states oftentimes acknowledge international legal governance, but their reaction is political in the end. In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe importance of indirect evidence in the attribution of state responsibility in cyberspace will be illustrated on the case of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. Although that case is a decade old, it is an example which involved the richest variety of indirect evidence of different kinds given that the cyber campaign accompanied military attacks on ground and thus served as a force multiplier. Moreover, because of the lapse of time between the campaign itself and the publication of this article, there is a sufficient number of quality sources for the discussion, as other potential cases for a study of this sort such as the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids would not provide such an advantage. The Russian-Georgian war was a typical example of the high degree of care with which cyber-attacks are usually prepared and of the timing and coordination of cyber and kinetic operations. The alleged good relations between the Kremlin, Russian organised crime and Russian youth organisations can serve as further possible indirect proof of certain involvement of Russian government in the cyber-attacks during the war. Because the Russian government has rejected all accusations of its involvement in the cyber-attacks, and no substantive direct link between the perpetrators of the attacks and the Russian government has ever been found, the chance that direct evidence would be uncovered to establish state responsibility in this case is marginal, as it is in the majority of similar cases. The Georgian case thus emphasises the importance of indirect evidence and illustrates the broad range of its types.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37)", "\u201cThis article begins by examining the concepts of attribution and state responsibility within the international legal framework applied to cyberspace. In that context, the article surveys the most often proposed doctrines of state responsibility attribution: the effective and the overall control doctrine. The following analytical section has five subsections. The first sub-section introduces the security and political context of the Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008. The following four sub-sections identify four different categories of indirect evidence of state responsibility for cyber-attacks: level of coordination, level of preparedness, state relations with the national hacker community, and the state conception of cyber-security.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37)", "\u201cThe article works with the international legal concepts of attribution and state responsibility and transfers them into an analysis of international relations. It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine. In the overall control doctrine, it suffices to find a proof of an operational control or support coming from a state to invoke state responsibility, which lowers the necessary threshold of evidence. Thus, our judgement could draw from the more common indirect evidence rather than from the oftentimes lacking direct evidence.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThis section analyses the cyber-warfare in the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008 and distils four different categories of indirect evidence from it. The analysis works mainly with secondary sources, such as publications from Project Grey Goose and other publications by recognised cyber experts (e.g. Dmitri Alperovitch [2009], Jeffrey Carr [2008], Jart Armin [2008a, 2008b], Eneken Tikk [et al. 2008] or Ronald Deibert, Rafal Rohozinski and Masashi Crete-Nishihata [2012]). The following analysis will begin with an introduction to the political and security background to the Russian-Georgian conflict in cyber-space in 2008. Later on, this section will introduce four different types of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cThe relations between the government of the suspected state and the national hacker community represents the third possible type of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks to states. Russia is traditionally known for its distinctive features of a huge reliance on cyber-crime structures, such as the aforementioned RBN, and technologically educated individuals from youth organisations such as Nashi, which is controlled by the Kremlin, and one has to bear in mind that the boundary between the two might often be very thin (Smith 2012: 3).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cThe proposed categorisation of indirect evidence is based on an analysis of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. On the one hand, the Russian government and officials have officially denied any engagement in the cyber-attacks and there is no first-hand evidence proving their involvement. On the other hand, as a number of pieces of indirect evidence illustrate, it is most likely that the Kremlin encouraged the attacks and provided the attackers with the necessary information to coordinate the cyber and kinetic operations. This particular case study was chosen because it provides one of the richest arrays of indirect evidence of various kinds, illustrating the flexibility of this form of proof in comparison to investigating cyber-attacks solely with a focus on direct evidence.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61349999999999%2C154.13920000000002%2C445.74049999999966%2C162.89920000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C142.95620000000002%2C445.74550000000016%2C151.71620000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C131.77320000000003%2C445.7584999999993%2C140.53320000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C120.59020000000004%2C445.7424999999995%2C129.35020000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C109.40720000000005%2C445.7384999999992%2C118.16720000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C98.22420000000005%2C445.6924999999992%2C106.98420000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C87.04120000000006%2C445.75649999999956%2C95.80120000000007%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law.

In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2236%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11789999999999%2C489.40449999999987%2C454.23589999999973%2C498.16449999999986%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C478.22749999999985%2C454.24289999999974%2C486.98749999999984%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C467.05049999999983%2C454.2568999999995%2C475.8104999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C455.8734999999998%2C454.2528999999992%2C464.6334999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C444.6964999999998%2C454.22689999999955%2C453.4564999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C433.51949999999977%2C454.241899999999%2C442.27949999999976%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C422.34249999999975%2C454.2588999999996%2C431.10249999999974%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C411.1654999999997%2C454.21589999999975%2C419.9254999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C399.9884999999997%2C454.2329000000003%2C408.7484999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C388.8114999999997%2C454.2299000000002%2C397.5714999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C377.63449999999966%2C454.21389999999957%2C386.39449999999965%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C366.45749999999964%2C454.2469000000004%2C375.21749999999963%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C355.2804999999996%2C454.2109000000004%2C364.0404999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C344.1034999999996%2C454.2448999999996%2C352.8634999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C332.9264999999996%2C454.1908999999999%2C341.68649999999957%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C321.74949999999956%2C454.17790000000036%2C330.50949999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C310.57249999999954%2C454.225899999999%2C319.3324999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C299.3954999999995%2C454.1888999999992%2C308.1554999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C288.2184999999995%2C454.22390000000007%2C296.9784999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C277.0414999999995%2C339.7668999999998%2C285.80149999999946%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C321.34130000000005%2C454.23909999999944%2C330.10130000000004%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C310.18430000000006%2C454.2500999999995%2C318.94430000000006%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C299.0273000000001%2C454.24109999999894%2C307.7873000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C287.8703000000001%2C454.227099999999%2C296.6303000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C276.7133000000001%2C454.23309999999884%2C285.4733000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C265.55630000000014%2C454.24509999999964%2C274.3163000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C254.39930000000012%2C454.23409999999893%2C263.15930000000014%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C243.2423000000001%2C454.23209999999904%2C252.00230000000013%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C232.0853000000001%2C454.2530999999994%2C240.84530000000012%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C220.9283000000001%2C454.2310999999997%2C229.6883000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C209.77130000000008%2C170.6171%2C218.5313000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2236%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11789999999999%2C265.8654999999995%2C454.2498999999994%2C274.6254999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C254.68849999999944%2C454.2348999999997%2C263.44849999999946%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C243.51149999999944%2C454.24489999999946%2C252.27149999999946%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C232.33449999999945%2C454.2578999999996%2C241.09449999999947%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C221.15749999999946%2C454.2358999999998%2C229.91749999999948%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C209.98049999999947%2C454.2598999999988%2C218.74049999999949%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C198.80349999999947%2C454.2148999999994%2C207.5634999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C187.62649999999948%2C454.2389000000004%2C196.3864999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C176.4494999999995%2C454.23789999999974%2C185.2094999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C165.2724999999995%2C454.2419000000003%2C174.03249999999952%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C154.0954999999995%2C454.2449000000005%2C162.85549999999952%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C142.9184999999995%2C454.22389999999956%2C151.67849999999953%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C131.74149999999952%2C454.2378999999998%2C140.50149999999954%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C120.56449999999953%2C454.2448999999997%2C129.32449999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C109.38749999999953%2C454.2408999999995%2C118.14749999999954%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C98.21049999999954%2C454.2308999999999%2C106.97049999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C87.03349999999955%2C454.2418999999993%2C95.79349999999955%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe importance of indirect evidence in the attribution of state responsibility in cyberspace will be illustrated on the case of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. Although that case is a decade old, it is an example which involved the richest variety of indirect evidence of different kinds given that the cyber campaign accompanied military attacks on ground and thus served as a force multiplier. Moreover, because of the lapse of time between the campaign itself and the publication of this article, there is a sufficient number of quality sources for the discussion, as other potential cases for a study of this sort such as the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids would not provide such an advantage. The Russian-Georgian war was a typical example of the high degree of care with which cyber-attacks are usually prepared and of the timing and coordination of cyber and kinetic operations. The alleged good relations between the Kremlin, Russian organised crime and Russian youth organisations can serve as further possible indirect proof of certain involvement of Russian government in the cyber-attacks during the war. Because the Russian government has rejected all accusations of its involvement in the cyber-attacks, and no substantive direct link between the perpetrators of the attacks and the Russian government has ever been found, the chance that direct evidence would be uncovered to establish state responsibility in this case is marginal, as it is in the majority</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87.6929%2C657.0503%2C445.7348999999996%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B87.6929%2C645.8933%2C257.11289999999997%2C654.6533%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">of similar cases.

In that context, the article surveys the most often proposed doctrines of state responsibility attribution: the effective and the overall control doctrine. The following analytical section has five subsections. The first sub-section introduces the security and political context of the Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008. The following four sub-sections identify four different categories of indirect evidence of state responsibility for cyber-attacks: level of coordination, level of preparedness, state relations with the national hacker community, and the state conception of cyber-security.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C198.61430000000007%2C454.2500999999997%2C207.3743000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C187.45730000000006%2C454.2370999999996%2C196.21730000000008%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C176.30030000000005%2C454.25110000000006%2C185.06030000000007%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C165.14330000000004%2C454.2621%2C173.90330000000006%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C153.98630000000003%2C454.2260999999987%2C162.74630000000005%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C142.82930000000002%2C454.2361000000003%2C151.58930000000004%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C131.6723%2C454.2491000000004%2C140.43230000000003%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C120.51530000000001%2C272.82710000000003%2C129.27530000000002%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe article works with the international legal concepts of attribution and state responsibility and transfers them into an analysis of international relations. It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine. In the overall control doctrine, it suffices to find a proof of an operational control or support coming from a state to invoke state responsibility, which lowers the necessary threshold of evidence. Thus, our judgement could draw from the more common indirect evidence rather than from the oftentimes lacking direct evidence.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2238%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C511.2646%2C454.23109999999986%2C520.0246%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C500.1276%2C454.2440999999996%2C508.88759999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C488.9906%2C454.19509999999946%2C497.75059999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C477.8536%2C454.21510000000023%2C486.61359999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C466.71659999999997%2C454.22109999999975%2C475.47659999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C455.57959999999997%2C454.22709999999967%2C464.33959999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C444.44259999999997%2C454.2500999999996%2C453.20259999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C433.30559999999997%2C454.23809999999884%2C442.06559999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C422.16859999999997%2C394.54709999999966%2C430.92859999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThis section analyses the cyber-warfare in the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008 and distils four different categories of indirect evidence from it. The analysis works mainly with secondary sources, such as publications from Project Grey Goose and other publications by recognised cyber experts (e.g. Dmitri Alperovitch [2009], Jeffrey Carr [2008], Jart Armin [2008a, 2008b], Eneken Tikk [et al. 2008] or Ronald Deibert, Rafal Rohozinski and Masashi Crete-Nishihata [2012]). The following analysis will begin with an introduction to the political and security background to the Russian-Georgian conflict in cyber-space in 2008. Later on, this section will introduce four different types of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C243.24259999999998%2C454.2400999999998%2C252.0026%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C232.08559999999997%2C454.2020999999999%2C240.8456%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C220.92859999999996%2C454.2440999999987%2C229.68859999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C209.77159999999995%2C454.24810000000036%2C218.53159999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C198.61459999999994%2C454.19710000000003%2C207.37459999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C187.45759999999993%2C454.25709999999964%2C196.21759999999995%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C176.30059999999992%2C329.2370999999999%2C185.06059999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe relations between the government of the suspected state and the national hacker community represents the third possible type of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks to states.

However, unlike in the cases of these four historically codified domains, a suitable international legal regime of cyberspace which would regulate it and include both jus ad bellum and jus in bello has appeared to be elusive so far, notably regarding the crucial issues of attribution and state responsibility. Modern technological advancement and its subsequent use in practice raises a range of international relations and legal concerns. For instance, cyber warfare deeply challenges the nature and understanding of the traditional perception of warfare. The attribution of a kinetic attack launched through conventional weaponry is obviously much easier to determine than the identity of a perpetrator of a cyber-attack. Alternatively, the transnational character of cyber-attacks leads to questioning of the current treaty framework, which is helpful but not sufficient since it does not properly cover issues such as state responsibility and sovereignty in cyberspace. The problems regarding defence against or launching of a cyber-assault are numerous, but the most fundamental issues are associated with attribution of these attacks and state responsibility for them. Although it can be technically possible to trace the geographical location of the attacker and so attribute the attack to some extent, it is difficult to actually determine who was sitting in front of the computer screen in the moment when the attack was launched; it could be a state representative, a group of hackers or an individual.

The categorization of indirect proof is based on the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008, which provides one of the richest arrays of this kind of evidence.

As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406). However, in contrast to the effective control doctrine, in its judgment in the Tadic\u0301 case the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the effective control standard is inconsistent with the practice of states and is not in accord with the logic of principles of state responsibility (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The ICTY (1999) concluded that if a state participates in the organisation and coordination of private actors, in addition to supporting them, it possesses sufficient overall control over them and so the conduct of the non-state actors can be attributed to the state.4\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61349999999999%2C154.13920000000002%2C445.74049999999966%2C162.89920000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C142.95620000000002%2C445.74550000000016%2C151.71620000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C131.77320000000003%2C445.7584999999993%2C140.53320000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C120.59020000000004%2C445.7424999999995%2C129.35020000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C109.40720000000005%2C445.7384999999992%2C118.16720000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C98.22420000000005%2C445.6924999999992%2C106.98420000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C87.04120000000006%2C445.75649999999956%2C95.80120000000007%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law.

In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C232.08540000000002%2C445.75419999999946%2C240.84540000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C220.9284%2C445.71619999999973%2C229.68840000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.7714%2C445.72919999999965%2C218.53140000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.6144%2C445.73519999999974%2C207.3744%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45739999999998%2C445.74019999999916%2C196.2174%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C176.30039999999997%2C445.733199999999%2C185.0604%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14339999999996%2C445.7312000000003%2C173.90339999999998%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98639999999995%2C445.7341999999998%2C162.74639999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82939999999994%2C445.7331999999996%2C151.58939999999996%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C131.67239999999993%2C445.7222000000002%2C140.43239999999994%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C120.51539999999993%2C445.70419999999956%2C129.27539999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C109.35839999999993%2C445.71519999999987%2C118.11839999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C98.20139999999994%2C445.7162000000004%2C106.96139999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69220000000004%2C87.04439999999994%2C445.7551999999996%2C95.80439999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406).

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001).

The most notorious one is the Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement \u201cOurs!\u201d (Molodezhnoye Demokraticheskoye Antifashistskoye Dvizhenye in Russian), also known as Nashi. Nashi was founded in 2005 with two main goals: firstly, it was meant as a counterweight to the growing popularity of Nazi ideology in the Russian Federation. Secondly, it was supposed to be a political tool to help Russia avoid a similar youth revolt like the one which evolved during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 (Atwal 2009). Although it officially claims to be funded by Russian business elites, speculations exist which claim that it gains its finances from the Kremlin (Carr 2011, Betz \u2013 Stevens 2011: 32). The purported link between Nashi and the Russian government is also based on other strong evidence. For example, in the late 2000s Vladislav Surkov, the then First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff and one of the closest co-workers of Vladimir Putin, was a very keen supporter of Nashi. He even proclaimed the intention to use Nashi\u2019s computer skills to enhance the will of the Kremlin in Russian cyberspace and to \u201censure the domination of pro-Kremlin views on the Internet\u201d (Carr 2009: 21). A practical example of this proclamation was reported in February 2009, when the Russian media published a story uncovering how the government encourages and funds the establishment of Russian youth organisations that are to get involved in cyber operations, including hacking and the subsequent suppression of opposition groups (Carr 2009: 21). Similarly, in 2009 Sergei Markov, a then State Duma Deputy, released the information that his assistant, most probably Konstantin Goloskov, a Nashi Commissar, had participated as one of the leaders in a cyber-attack against Estonia two years earlier (Carr 2009: 22). Thus, it appears that the Kremlin might be taking advantage of its very good relations with the youth organisations and their technologically educated and talented individual members as well.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C232.08540000000002%2C445.75419999999946%2C240.84540000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C220.9284%2C445.71619999999973%2C229.68840000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.7714%2C445.72919999999965%2C218.53140000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.6144%2C445.73519999999974%2C207.3744%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45739999999998%2C445.74019999999916%2C196.2174%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C176.30039999999997%2C445.733199999999%2C185.0604%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14339999999996%2C445.7312000000003%2C173.90339999999998%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98639999999995%2C445.7341999999998%2C162.74639999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82939999999994%2C445.7331999999996%2C151.58939999999996%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C131.67239999999993%2C445.7222000000002%2C140.43239999999994%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C120.51539999999993%2C445.70419999999956%2C129.27539999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C109.35839999999993%2C445.71519999999987%2C118.11839999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C98.20139999999994%2C445.7162000000004%2C106.96139999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69220000000004%2C87.04439999999994%2C445.7551999999996%2C95.80439999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406). However, in contrast to the effective control doctrine, in its judgment in the Tadic\u0301 case the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the effective control</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2238%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A3%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.2377999999998%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.9133%2C454.23079999999976%2C654.6733%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7763000000001%2C454.25679999999943%2C643.5363000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.6393000000002%2C454.22679999999986%2C632.3993000000002%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C612.5023000000002%2C294.9019%2C621.978%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%7D\">standard is inconsistent with the practice of states and is not in accord with the logic of principles of state responsibility (Tikk et al. 2008: 21).

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect.

The most notorious one is the Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement \u201cOurs!\u201d (Molodezhnoye Demokraticheskoye Antifashistskoye Dvizhenye in Russian), also known as Nashi. Nashi was founded in 2005 with two main goals: firstly, it was meant as a counterweight to the growing popularity of Nazi ideology in the Russian Federation. Secondly, it was supposed to be a political tool to help Russia avoid a similar youth revolt like the one which evolved during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004 (Atwal 2009). Although it officially claims to be funded by Russian business elites, speculations exist which claim that it gains its finances from the Kremlin (Carr 2011, Betz \u2013 Stevens 2011: 32). The purported link between Nashi and the Russian government is also based on other strong evidence. For example, in the late 2000s Vladislav Surkov, the then First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff and one of the closest co-workers of Vladimir Putin, was a very keen supporter of Nashi. He even proclaimed the intention to use Nashi\u2019s computer skills to enhance the will of the Kremlin in Russian cyberspace and to \u201censure the domination of pro-Kremlin views on the Internet\u201d (Carr 2009: 21). A practical example of this proclamation was reported in February 2009, when the Russian media published a story uncovering how the government encourages and funds the establishment of Russian youth organisations that are to get involved in cyber operations, including hacking and the subsequent suppression of opposition groups (Carr 2009: 21). Similarly, in 2009 Sergei Markov, a then State Duma Deputy, released the information that his assistant, most probably Konstantin Goloskov, a Nashi Commissar, had participated as one of the leaders in a cyber-attack against Estonia two years earlier (Carr 2009: 22). Thus, it appears that the Kremlin might be taking advantage of its very good relations with the youth organisations and their technologically educated and talented individual members as well.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain.

Cyber-Attacks and the Russian-Georgian Conflict:3.5 The state conception of cyber-security", "2. Attribution of State Responsibility in Cyberspace"], "paragraph_title": ["Russian cyber security documents highlight a distinct approach differing from Western perspectives.", "The effective control doctrine requires direct state control for attributing responsibility."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406). However, in contrast to the effective control doctrine, in its judgment in the Tadic\u0301 case the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the effective control standard is inconsistent with the practice of states and is not in accord with the logic of principles of state responsibility (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The ICTY (1999) concluded that if a state participates in the organisation and coordination of private actors, in addition to supporting them, it possesses sufficient overall control over them and so the conduct of the non-state actors can be attributed to the state.4\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C232.08540000000002%2C445.75419999999946%2C240.84540000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C220.9284%2C445.71619999999973%2C229.68840000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.7714%2C445.72919999999965%2C218.53140000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.6144%2C445.73519999999974%2C207.3744%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45739999999998%2C445.74019999999916%2C196.2174%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C176.30039999999997%2C445.733199999999%2C185.0604%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14339999999996%2C445.7312000000003%2C173.90339999999998%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98639999999995%2C445.7341999999998%2C162.74639999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82939999999994%2C445.7331999999996%2C151.58939999999996%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C131.67239999999993%2C445.7222000000002%2C140.43239999999994%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C120.51539999999993%2C445.70419999999956%2C129.27539999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C109.35839999999993%2C445.71519999999987%2C118.11839999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C98.20139999999994%2C445.7162000000004%2C106.96139999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69220000000004%2C87.04439999999994%2C445.7551999999996%2C95.80439999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406).

It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine. In the overall control doctrine, it suffices to find a proof of an operational control or support coming from a state to invoke state responsibility, which lowers the necessary threshold of evidence. Thus, our judgement could draw from the more common indirect evidence rather than from the oftentimes lacking direct evidence.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law. Yet, many international actors do not hesitate to attribute responsibility in political terms, and with political consequences. It is clear that key actors in international law and international relations understand the issue of attribution in different ways \u2013 international law perceives it through the work of international courts of justice and lawyers who apply binding international legal rules while international relations are based on the (oftentimes rather pragmatic) behaviour of governments and international organisations, and the work of politicians, journalists or, for example, activists. They have different understandings of what is viable and legitimate in their fields. There are various methods which define states\u2019 behaviour within international relations which, however, might not be necessarily supported by international legal norms. On the other hand, states oftentimes acknowledge international legal governance, but their reaction is political in the end. In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cThis article begins by examining the concepts of attribution and state responsibility within the international legal framework applied to cyberspace. In that context, the article surveys the most often proposed doctrines of state responsibility attribution: the effective and the overall control doctrine. The following analytical section has five subsections. The first sub-section introduces the security and political context of the Russian-Georgian conflict in 2008. The following four sub-sections identify four different categories of indirect evidence of state responsibility for cyber-attacks: level of coordination, level of preparedness, state relations with the national hacker community, and the state conception of cyber-security.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe importance of indirect evidence in the attribution of state responsibility in cyberspace will be illustrated on the case of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. Although that case is a decade old, it is an example which involved the richest variety of indirect evidence of different kinds given that the cyber campaign accompanied military attacks on ground and thus served as a force multiplier. Moreover, because of the lapse of time between the campaign itself and the publication of this article, there is a sufficient number of quality sources for the discussion, as other potential cases for a study of this sort such as the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids would not provide such an advantage. The Russian-Georgian war was a typical example of the high degree of care with which cyber-attacks are usually prepared and of the timing and coordination of cyber and kinetic operations. The alleged good relations between the Kremlin, Russian organised crime and Russian youth organisations can serve as further possible indirect proof of certain involvement of Russian government in the cyber-attacks during the war. Because the Russian government has rejected all accusations of its involvement in the cyber-attacks, and no substantive direct link between the perpetrators of the attacks and the Russian government has ever been found, the chance that direct evidence would be uncovered to establish state responsibility in this case is marginal, as it is in the majority of similar cases. The Georgian case thus emphasises the importance of indirect evidence and illustrates the broad range of its types.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37)", "\u201cThe relations between the government of the suspected state and the national hacker community represents the third possible type of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks to states.

It begins from the assumption that the overall control doctrine of state responsibility is more suitable for cyberspace in international relations than the effective control doctrine. In the overall control doctrine, it suffices to find a proof of an operational control or support coming from a state to invoke state responsibility, which lowers the necessary threshold of evidence. Thus, our judgement could draw from the more common indirect evidence rather than from the oftentimes lacking direct evidence.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2236%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11789999999999%2C489.40449999999987%2C454.23589999999973%2C498.16449999999986%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C478.22749999999985%2C454.24289999999974%2C486.98749999999984%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C467.05049999999983%2C454.2568999999995%2C475.8104999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C455.8734999999998%2C454.2528999999992%2C464.6334999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C444.6964999999998%2C454.22689999999955%2C453.4564999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C433.51949999999977%2C454.241899999999%2C442.27949999999976%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C422.34249999999975%2C454.2588999999996%2C431.10249999999974%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C411.1654999999997%2C454.21589999999975%2C419.9254999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C399.9884999999997%2C454.2329000000003%2C408.7484999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C388.8114999999997%2C454.2299000000002%2C397.5714999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C377.63449999999966%2C454.21389999999957%2C386.39449999999965%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C366.45749999999964%2C454.2469000000004%2C375.21749999999963%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C355.2804999999996%2C454.2109000000004%2C364.0404999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C344.1034999999996%2C454.2448999999996%2C352.8634999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C332.9264999999996%2C454.1908999999999%2C341.68649999999957%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C321.74949999999956%2C454.17790000000036%2C330.50949999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C310.57249999999954%2C454.225899999999%2C319.3324999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C299.3954999999995%2C454.1888999999992%2C308.1554999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C288.2184999999995%2C454.22390000000007%2C296.9784999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C277.0414999999995%2C339.7668999999998%2C285.80149999999946%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61349999999999%2C154.13920000000002%2C445.74049999999966%2C162.89920000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C142.95620000000002%2C445.74550000000016%2C151.71620000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C131.77320000000003%2C445.7584999999993%2C140.53320000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C120.59020000000004%2C445.7424999999995%2C129.35020000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C109.40720000000005%2C445.7384999999992%2C118.16720000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C98.22420000000005%2C445.6924999999992%2C106.98420000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C87.04120000000006%2C445.75649999999956%2C95.80120000000007%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law.

As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic.

The following four sub-sections identify four different categories of indirect evidence of state responsibility for cyber-attacks: level of coordination, level of preparedness, state relations with the national hacker community, and the state conception of cyber-security.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 37</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C321.34130000000005%2C454.23909999999944%2C330.10130000000004%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C310.18430000000006%2C454.2500999999995%2C318.94430000000006%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C299.0273000000001%2C454.24109999999894%2C307.7873000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C287.8703000000001%2C454.227099999999%2C296.6303000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C276.7133000000001%2C454.23309999999884%2C285.4733000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C265.55630000000014%2C454.24509999999964%2C274.3163000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C254.39930000000012%2C454.23409999999893%2C263.15930000000014%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C243.2423000000001%2C454.23209999999904%2C252.00230000000013%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C232.0853000000001%2C454.2530999999994%2C240.84530000000012%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C220.9283000000001%2C454.2310999999997%2C229.6883000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C209.77130000000008%2C170.6171%2C218.5313000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2236%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11789999999999%2C265.8654999999995%2C454.2498999999994%2C274.6254999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C254.68849999999944%2C454.2348999999997%2C263.44849999999946%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C243.51149999999944%2C454.24489999999946%2C252.27149999999946%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C232.33449999999945%2C454.2578999999996%2C241.09449999999947%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C221.15749999999946%2C454.2358999999998%2C229.91749999999948%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C209.98049999999947%2C454.2598999999988%2C218.74049999999949%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C198.80349999999947%2C454.2148999999994%2C207.5634999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C187.62649999999948%2C454.2389000000004%2C196.3864999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C176.4494999999995%2C454.23789999999974%2C185.2094999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C165.2724999999995%2C454.2419000000003%2C174.03249999999952%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C154.0954999999995%2C454.2449000000005%2C162.85549999999952%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C142.9184999999995%2C454.22389999999956%2C151.67849999999953%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C131.74149999999952%2C454.2378999999998%2C140.50149999999954%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C120.56449999999953%2C454.2448999999997%2C129.32449999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C109.38749999999953%2C454.2408999999995%2C118.14749999999954%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C98.21049999999954%2C454.2308999999999%2C106.97049999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C87.03349999999955%2C454.2418999999993%2C95.79349999999955%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe importance of indirect evidence in the attribution of state responsibility in cyberspace will be illustrated on the case of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. Although that case is a decade old, it is an example which involved the richest variety of indirect evidence of different kinds given that the cyber campaign accompanied military attacks on ground and thus served as a force multiplier. Moreover, because of the lapse of time between the campaign itself and the publication of this article, there is a sufficient number of quality sources for the discussion, as other potential cases for a study of this sort such as the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids would not provide such an advantage. The Russian-Georgian war was a typical example of the high degree of care with which cyber-attacks are usually prepared and of the timing and coordination of cyber and kinetic operations. The alleged good relations between the Kremlin, Russian organised crime and Russian youth organisations can serve as further possible indirect proof of certain involvement of Russian government in the cyber-attacks during the war. Because the Russian government has rejected all accusations of its involvement in the cyber-attacks, and no substantive direct link between the perpetrators of the attacks and the Russian government has ever been found, the chance that direct evidence would be uncovered to establish state responsibility in this case is marginal, as it is in the majority</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B87.6929%2C657.0503%2C445.7348999999996%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B87.6929%2C645.8933%2C257.11289999999997%2C654.6533%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">of similar cases.

Although some minor cyber-attacks on Georgian websites had been launched a couple of days or weeks before the Russian troops entered Georgian territory, the major wave of assaults in cyberspace was coordinated with the main military operation. It appears that the organisers of the cyber-attacks had advanced knowledge of what the Russian military intentions were and subsequently, they were given notice about the Russian campaign on the ground while the assaults were being executed. The cyber-attacks of the largest scale commenced at the same time that the Russian military began its operations, and they ended just a while after the Russians accomplished the aims of their campaign so it almost indicates that the operation in cyberspace supplemented those on the ground (Bumgarner \u2013 Borg 2009: 6). Asmus (2010: 167) also takes note of a high degree of \u201cdiscipline, coordination, command, and control\u201d in the cyber-attacks against the Georgian financial and banking sector, which closely followed the kinetic operations on the ground.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)", "\u201cThe proposed categorisation of indirect evidence is based on an analysis of the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008. On the one hand, the Russian government and officials have officially denied any engagement in the cyber-attacks and there is no first-hand evidence proving their involvement. On the other hand, as a number of pieces of indirect evidence illustrate, it is most likely that the Kremlin encouraged the attacks and provided the attackers with the necessary information to coordinate the cyber and kinetic operations. This particular case study was chosen because it provides one of the richest arrays of indirect evidence of various kinds, illustrating the flexibility of this form of proof in comparison to investigating cyber-attacks solely with a focus on direct evidence.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cThe third category of indirect evidence to investigate is the long-term relations between the state institutions and the national hacker community. For example, in countries with a long and prosperous history of criminal networks, criminal mobs oftentimes follow up on their usual activities with their malicious activities in cyberspace and thus might become convenient partners for a sponsoring state, especially if they can build on previously established contacts. A similar example is the case of youth organisations with a progovernment ideology and government contacts which unite young people with a talent for IT who are eager to support their state\u2019s activities.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe analysis provides the reader with a categorisation of indirect evidence which, however, has a limited impact. This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types. Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic. Future research might also focus on other major cases of cyber-attacks \u2013 for example, the 2010 Stuxnet worm used against the Iranian nuclear programme, and the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids, which can both potentially offer further indirect evidence for related studies.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43)", "\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law. Yet, many international actors do not hesitate to attribute responsibility in political terms, and with political consequences. It is clear that key actors in international law and international relations understand the issue of attribution in different ways \u2013 international law perceives it through the work of international courts of justice and lawyers who apply binding international legal rules while international relations are based on the (oftentimes rather pragmatic) behaviour of governments and international organisations, and the work of politicians, journalists or, for example, activists. They have different understandings of what is viable and legitimate in their fields. There are various methods which define states\u2019 behaviour within international relations which, however, might not be necessarily supported by international legal norms. On the other hand, states oftentimes acknowledge international legal governance, but their reaction is political in the end. In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic. In other words, accepting that direct evidence is mostly unavailable, the article asks which indirect evidence might be available to reliably establish attribution in international relations.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cThis section analyses the cyber-warfare in the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008 and distils four different categories of indirect evidence from it. The analysis works mainly with secondary sources, such as publications from Project Grey Goose and other publications by recognised cyber experts (e.g. Dmitri Alperovitch [2009], Jeffrey Carr [2008], Jart Armin [2008a, 2008b], Eneken Tikk [et al. 2008] or Ronald Deibert, Rafal Rohozinski and Masashi Crete-Nishihata [2012]). The following analysis will begin with an introduction to the political and security background to the Russian-Georgian conflict in cyber-space in 2008. Later on, this section will introduce four different types of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36)", "\u201cRussia\u2019s official approach toward cyber security might also offer a clue as to whether the Russian government was or was not involved in the cyber-attacks on Georgia, thus forming the last type of categorisation of indirect evidence introduced in the article. As early as September 2000, the Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation defined three major objectives: the first of them is common to most of the world \u2013 to protect strategically important information (Security Council of the Russian Federation 2000). However, the other two objectives distinguish Russia from most of the democratic world: \u201cto protect against deleterious foreign information and to inculcate in the people patriotism and values\u201d (Smith 2012: 2\u20133). This doctrine has then settled a broader Russian cyber security framework for both the military and civilian spheres for the next decade.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6142%2C611.5008%2C445.74220000000025%2C620.2608%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C600.3638000000001%2C445.7332000000004%2C609.1238000000001%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C589.2268000000001%2C445.7171999999992%2C597.9868000000001%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C578.0898000000002%2C445.75319999999965%2C586.8498000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C566.9528000000003%2C445.74719999999957%2C575.7128000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C555.8158000000003%2C445.73119999999943%2C564.5758000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C544.6788000000004%2C445.70519999999897%2C553.4388000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C533.5418000000004%2C445.75319999999965%2C542.3018000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C522.4048000000005%2C445.7311999999997%2C531.1648000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C511.26780000000053%2C445.7452000000001%2C520.0278000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C500.13080000000053%2C445.7241999999991%2C508.8908000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C488.99380000000053%2C445.7011999999998%2C497.7538000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C477.85680000000053%2C445.73519999999974%2C486.6168000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C466.71980000000053%2C303.2231999999999%2C475.4798000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe first category of indirect evidence is the timing and coordination of the attacks taking place in cyberspace and on the ground.

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2243%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A8%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6139%2C235.82029999999995%2C445.73490000000055%2C244.58029999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C224.73529999999994%2C445.74590000000046%2C233.49529999999996%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C213.65029999999993%2C445.75189999999947%2C222.41029999999995%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C202.56529999999992%2C445.7458999999997%2C211.32529999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C191.48029999999991%2C445.72889999999967%2C200.24029999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C180.3952999999999%2C445.73889999999966%2C189.15529999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C169.3102999999999%2C445.72389999999984%2C178.07029999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C158.2252999999999%2C445.7288999999996%2C166.9852999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C147.14029999999988%2C445.729899999999%2C155.9002999999999%5D%2C%5B87.69290000000001%2C136.05529999999987%2C232.93290000000002%2C144.8152999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe analysis provides the reader with a categorisation of indirect evidence which, however, has a limited impact. This article focussed only on one cyber campaign, thus offering only a limited number of types of indirect evidence, and not necessarily an exhaustive list of indirect evidence types. Thus, adding other categories to this categorisation of indirect evidence based on an analysis of a broader spectrum of individual cases from practice might certainly become a useful and much needed goal of future studies on the topic. Future research might also focus on other major cases of cyber-attacks \u2013 for example, the 2010 Stuxnet worm used against the Iranian nuclear programme, and the 2015 cyber-attacks against Ukrainian power grids, which can both potentially offer further indirect evidence for related studies.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2243%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 43</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2235%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A0%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61349999999999%2C154.13920000000002%2C445.74049999999966%2C162.89920000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C142.95620000000002%2C445.74550000000016%2C151.71620000000004%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C131.77320000000003%2C445.7584999999993%2C140.53320000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C120.59020000000004%2C445.7424999999995%2C129.35020000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C109.40720000000005%2C445.7384999999992%2C118.16720000000005%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C98.22420000000005%2C445.6924999999992%2C106.98420000000006%5D%2C%5B87.6925%2C87.04120000000006%2C445.75649999999956%2C95.80120000000007%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2235%22%7D%7D\">\u201cWe are often in lack of convincing direct evidence which would allow us to attribute responsibility for cyber-attacks in terms of international law.

In this regard, this article works with international legal concepts, but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. As such, the article at hand is an exploratory study which aims to highlight and examine the importance of indirect evidence, which is an international legal concept, in the political attribution of state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations.2 The goal of this article is to introduce a basic categorisation of indirect evidence which could serve as a starting point for future research on the given topic.

The following analysis will begin with an introduction to the political and security background to the Russian-Georgian conflict in cyber-space in 2008. Later on, this section will introduce four different types of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2238%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2236%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11789999999999%2C489.40449999999987%2C454.23589999999973%2C498.16449999999986%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C478.22749999999985%2C454.24289999999974%2C486.98749999999984%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C467.05049999999983%2C454.2568999999995%2C475.8104999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C455.8734999999998%2C454.2528999999992%2C464.6334999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C444.6964999999998%2C454.22689999999955%2C453.4564999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C433.51949999999977%2C454.241899999999%2C442.27949999999976%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C422.34249999999975%2C454.2588999999996%2C431.10249999999974%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C411.1654999999997%2C454.21589999999975%2C419.9254999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C399.9884999999997%2C454.2329000000003%2C408.7484999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C388.8114999999997%2C454.2299000000002%2C397.5714999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C377.63449999999966%2C454.21389999999957%2C386.39449999999965%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C366.45749999999964%2C454.2469000000004%2C375.21749999999963%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C355.2804999999996%2C454.2109000000004%2C364.0404999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C344.1034999999996%2C454.2448999999996%2C352.8634999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C332.9264999999996%2C454.1908999999999%2C341.68649999999957%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C321.74949999999956%2C454.17790000000036%2C330.50949999999955%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C310.57249999999954%2C454.225899999999%2C319.3324999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C299.3954999999995%2C454.1888999999992%2C308.1554999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C288.2184999999995%2C454.22390000000007%2C296.9784999999995%5D%2C%5B96.1969%2C277.0414999999995%2C339.7668999999998%2C285.80149999999946%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6142%2C220.9287%2C445.7241999999995%2C229.6887%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.77169999999998%2C445.72219999999965%2C218.5317%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.61469999999997%2C445.74719999999974%2C207.3747%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45769999999996%2C445.7161999999996%2C196.21769999999998%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C176.30069999999995%2C445.6952%2C185.06069999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14369999999994%2C445.7111999999996%2C173.90369999999996%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98669999999993%2C445.72919999999954%2C162.74669999999995%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82969999999992%2C445.72419999999954%2C151.58969999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C131.6726999999999%2C445.70420000000024%2C140.43269999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C120.51569999999991%2C445.7382000000002%2C129.27569999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C109.35869999999991%2C117.95319999999998%2C118.11869999999992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cRussia\u2019s official approach toward cyber security might also offer a clue as to whether the Russian government was or was not involved in the cyber-attacks on Georgia, thus forming the last type of categorisation of indirect evidence introduced in the article. As early as September 2000, the Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation defined three major objectives: the first of them is common to most of the world \u2013 to protect strategically important information (Security Council of the Russian Federation 2000). However, the other two objectives distinguish Russia from most of the democratic world: \u201cto protect against deleterious foreign information and to inculcate in the people patriotism and values\u201d (Smith 2012: 2\u20133). This doctrine has then settled a broader Russian cyber security framework for both the military and civilian spheres for the next decade.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain.

The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001).

Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406). However, in contrast to the effective control doctrine, in its judgment in the Tadic\u0301 case the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the effective control standard is inconsistent with the practice of states and is not in accord with the logic of principles of state responsibility (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The ICTY (1999) concluded that if a state participates in the organisation and coordination of private actors, in addition to supporting them, it possesses sufficient overall control over them and so the conduct of the non-state actors can be attributed to the state.4\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C232.08540000000002%2C445.75419999999946%2C240.84540000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C220.9284%2C445.71619999999973%2C229.68840000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.7714%2C445.72919999999965%2C218.53140000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.6144%2C445.73519999999974%2C207.3744%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45739999999998%2C445.74019999999916%2C196.2174%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C176.30039999999997%2C445.733199999999%2C185.0604%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14339999999996%2C445.7312000000003%2C173.90339999999998%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98639999999995%2C445.7341999999998%2C162.74639999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82939999999994%2C445.7331999999996%2C151.58939999999996%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C131.67239999999993%2C445.7222000000002%2C140.43239999999994%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C120.51539999999993%2C445.70419999999956%2C129.27539999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C109.35839999999993%2C445.71519999999987%2C118.11839999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C98.20139999999994%2C445.7162000000004%2C106.96139999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69220000000004%2C87.04439999999994%2C445.7551999999996%2C95.80439999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984.

They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C657.0503%2C454.2200999999991%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C645.8933%2C454.2370999999989%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.23909999999967%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.25109999999967%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.25910000000033%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2330999999996%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2420999999997%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.2350999999999%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22809999999987%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2491000000001%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.2047999999999%2C554.9576%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C534.3235999999999%2C295.62679999999995%2C543.0835999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion.

Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001).

Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C321.34130000000005%2C454.23909999999944%2C330.10130000000004%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C310.18430000000006%2C454.2500999999995%2C318.94430000000006%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C299.0273000000001%2C454.24109999999894%2C307.7873000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C287.8703000000001%2C454.227099999999%2C296.6303000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C276.7133000000001%2C454.23309999999884%2C285.4733000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C265.55630000000014%2C454.24509999999964%2C274.3163000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C254.39930000000012%2C454.23409999999893%2C263.15930000000014%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C243.2423000000001%2C454.23209999999904%2C252.00230000000013%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C232.0853000000001%2C454.2530999999994%2C240.84530000000012%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C220.9283000000001%2C454.2310999999997%2C229.6883000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C209.77130000000008%2C170.6171%2C218.5313000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow.

In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead.

Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339).

Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace. Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C657.0503%2C454.2200999999991%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C645.8933%2C454.2370999999989%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.23909999999967%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.25109999999967%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.25910000000033%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2330999999996%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2420999999997%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.2350999999999%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22809999999987%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2491000000001%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.2047999999999%2C554.9576%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C534.3235999999999%2C295.62679999999995%2C543.0835999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion.

This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow.

Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow.

The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect.

Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow.

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339).

The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace.

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C657.0503%2C454.2200999999991%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C645.8933%2C454.2370999999989%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.23909999999967%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.25109999999967%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.25910000000033%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2330999999996%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2420999999997%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.2350999999999%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22809999999987%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2491000000001%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.2047999999999%2C554.9576%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C534.3235999999999%2C295.62679999999995%2C543.0835999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001).

Cyber-attacks committed by non-state actors that were supported by governments in various manners and on various scales have generally been more common in the past several years. States use the non-state actors to hide behind them so as to avoid accountability for malicious cyber campaigns. Hence, there is an urgent need for states which become victims of such cyber-attacks to start invoking state responsibility and thus narrow this grey area if they want international norms to apply to this new domain. So far, it seems that the only reliable way to determine state responsibility is to analyse indirect proofs which have the potential to build a strong attribution beyond a reasonable doubt in a number of cases.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)", "\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C321.34130000000005%2C454.23909999999944%2C330.10130000000004%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C310.18430000000006%2C454.2500999999995%2C318.94430000000006%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C299.0273000000001%2C454.24109999999894%2C307.7873000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C287.8703000000001%2C454.227099999999%2C296.6303000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C276.7133000000001%2C454.23309999999884%2C285.4733000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C265.55630000000014%2C454.24509999999964%2C274.3163000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C254.39930000000012%2C454.23409999999893%2C263.15930000000014%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C243.2423000000001%2C454.23209999999904%2C252.00230000000013%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C232.0853000000001%2C454.2530999999994%2C240.84530000000012%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C220.9283000000001%2C454.2310999999997%2C229.6883000000001%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C209.77130000000008%2C170.6171%2C218.5313000000001%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe goal of this exploratory study was to articulate a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used by international actors to attribute responsibility to states for attacks in cyberspace.

The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain.

As early as September 2000, the Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation defined three major objectives: the first of them is common to most of the world \u2013 to protect strategically important information (Security Council of the Russian Federation 2000). However, the other two objectives distinguish Russia from most of the democratic world: \u201cto protect against deleterious foreign information and to inculcate in the people patriotism and values\u201d (Smith 2012: 2\u20133). This doctrine has then settled a broader Russian cyber security framework for both the military and civilian spheres for the next decade.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41)", "\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39)", "\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect.

Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40)", "\u201cAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, an unstable economy and limited labour market opportunities resulted in many highly educated and technologically qualified Russian individuals starting their own cyber-crime activities. These factors combined with a lack of legal enforcement and a power vacuum then contributed to the boom of cyber-crime business in Russia (Kadlecov\u00e1 2015), including clandestine activities for the Russian government in the post-Soviet era (Alperovitch 2009). Oleg Gordievsky, a former KGB Colonel until his defection to the British MI6 in 1985, openly explained to the public at an international conference in 1998 how hackers convicted of cyber-crimes in Russia are occasionally offered an alternative to imprisonment \u2013 employing their technological skills and working for the Russian FSB (Krebs 2008). Khatuna Mshvidobadze (2011) highlights another example of such suspicious Russian cyber activities \u2013 the Russian internationally-known \u201chacker schools\u201d, where tuition fees are often paid by unspecified donors. One of such hacker education institutions in Russia is supposedly run by the former Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information (FAPSI) in Voronezh. Moreover, Khaker: Computer Hooligan Magazine is particularly popular among the young generation in Russia, where any print content unacceptable to the Kremlin usually suffers from serious existential obstacles (Mshvidobadze 2011). Hence, it appears that Russia has a great potential to preserve its status as a cyber-crime power.\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.6142%2C220.9287%2C445.7241999999995%2C229.6887%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.77169999999998%2C445.72219999999965%2C218.5317%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.61469999999997%2C445.74719999999974%2C207.3747%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45769999999996%2C445.7161999999996%2C196.21769999999998%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C176.30069999999995%2C445.6952%2C185.06069999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14369999999994%2C445.7111999999996%2C173.90369999999996%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98669999999993%2C445.72919999999954%2C162.74669999999995%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82969999999992%2C445.72419999999954%2C151.58969999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C131.6726999999999%2C445.70420000000024%2C140.43269999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C120.51569999999991%2C445.7382000000002%2C129.27569999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C109.35869999999991%2C117.95319999999998%2C118.11869999999992%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cRussia\u2019s official approach toward cyber security might also offer a clue as to whether the Russian government was or was not involved in the cyber-attacks on Georgia, thus forming the last type of categorisation of indirect evidence introduced in the article.

This doctrine has then settled a broader Russian cyber security framework for both the military and civilian spheres for the next decade.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 41</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2239%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C455.58280000000053%2C445.7121999999996%2C464.3428000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C444.44580000000053%2C445.7351999999996%2C453.2058000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C433.30880000000053%2C445.73019999999974%2C442.0688000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C422.17180000000053%2C445.7541999999995%2C430.9318000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C411.03480000000053%2C445.72319999999985%2C419.7948000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C399.89780000000053%2C445.7261999999997%2C408.6578000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C388.76080000000053%2C445.73519999999894%2C397.5208000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C377.62380000000053%2C445.7291999999996%2C386.3838000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C366.4868000000005%2C445.72319999999945%2C375.2468000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C355.3498000000005%2C445.73120000000046%2C364.1098000000005%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C344.2128000000005%2C170.82319999999999%2C352.9728000000005%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%7D\">\u201cJohn Bumgarner and Scott Borg (2009: 6) from the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit also point out the telling choices of the targets for the cyber-attacks, as in most of the cases, attacks against these targets would have brought benefits for Moscow. They claim that during an ordinary military assault the communication facilities and media stations are usually destroyed or at least damaged by airstrikes or bombs. In the case of Georgia, they were spared physical damage and were put out of order by cyber-attacks instead. A tangible example is the case of the city of Gori, where the official websites and news sites were shut down before the Russian military aircraft even reached the city (Menn 2008). Thus, it seems that quite a widespread consensus exists that the operations in cyberspace and on the ground appear coordinated from the beginning in regard to both timing and the choice of targets.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2239%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 39</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2241%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A6%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C98.20169999999992%2C445.7461999999998%2C106.96169999999992%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C87.04469999999992%2C445.71119999999974%2C95.80469999999993%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2241%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe Russian public stance on issues of cyber security might be illustrated by the examples of two documents \u2013 the Concept of a Convention on International Information</span> <span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2242%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A7%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B96.1968%2C657.0503%2C454.1968%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C645.8933%2C454.23179999999996%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.2237999999995%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.215799999999%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.21779999999956%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2447999999998%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2397999999999%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.23679999999945%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22879999999975%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2537999999988%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.232799999999%2C554.2402999999996%5D%2C%5B96.19679999999997%2C534.3232999999996%2C383.9367999999998%2C543.0832999999996%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%7D\">Security (Russian Federation 2011) and the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe 2001). The former was released in September 2011 and it defines the key issues which concern Russia in cyberspace. As Keir Giles (2012: 64) notes, the document sets Russia apart from the Western approach when it perceives \u201cthe use of content for influence on the social-humanitarian sphere\u201d as a threat while most of the other countries consider a hostile code to be a real danger in this respect. The Concept also touches upon Internet sovereignty, which is a bone of contention for Russia, along with several like-minded states, and the rest of the world. Russia advocates that a state should control all Internet resources which are based within its physical frontier and subsequently it should manage its cyberspace according to the local legislation. This step would cause each state to define its own regulations of the Internet, which, as argued by the West, would undermine human rights as well as the interoperability of the Internet (Giles 2012: 65\u201366).\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2242%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 42</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.1181%2C657.0503%2C454.2200999999991%2C665.8103%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C645.8933%2C454.2370999999989%2C654.6533%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C634.7362999999999%2C454.23909999999967%2C643.4962999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C623.5792999999999%2C454.25109999999967%2C632.3392999999999%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C612.4222999999998%2C454.25910000000033%2C621.1822999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C601.2652999999998%2C454.2330999999996%2C610.0252999999998%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C590.1082999999998%2C454.2420999999997%2C598.8682999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C578.9512999999997%2C454.2350999999999%2C587.7112999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C567.7942999999997%2C454.22809999999987%2C576.5542999999997%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C556.6372999999996%2C454.2491000000001%2C565.3972999999996%5D%2C%5B96.1971%2C545.4802999999996%2C454.2047999999999%2C554.9576%5D%2C%5B96.1968%2C534.3235999999999%2C295.62679999999995%2C543.0835999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cEven the distribution of malicious software and information on how and which Georgian websites were to be attacked can arouse suspicion. Posting cyber-attack tools on specially designated websites was the main method for attackers to expand the cyber campaign. The fact that the attacked websites\u2019 vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited signals a certain level of planning, targeted reconnaissance and technical sophistication (Tikk et al. 2008: 38\u201339). Moreover, although the two types of cyber-attacks launched against Georgian websites \u2013 defacement and denial of service \u2013 are usually considered to have a rather unsophisticated nature, in this case, the operations were carried out in a highly sophisticated way. Cyber security researcher Jart Armin (2008a, 2008b) even notes that the character of these attacks strikingly reminds one of the methods usually employed by the organised cyber crime mob Russian Business Network (RBN)8 in order to avoid investigation and put the blame on other suspects.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 40</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2240%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A5%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B106.11810000000003%2C165.1435999999999%2C454.2330999999995%2C173.90359999999993%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C153.9865999999999%2C454.209099999999%2C162.74659999999992%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C142.82959999999989%2C454.24509999999975%2C151.5895999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C131.67259999999987%2C454.2370999999998%2C140.4325999999999%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C120.51559999999988%2C454.23310000000004%2C129.27559999999988%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C109.35859999999988%2C454.2150999999998%2C118.11859999999989%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C98.20159999999989%2C454.2470999999999%2C106.96159999999989%5D%2C%5B96.19710000000003%2C87.04459999999989%2C454.24109999999996%2C95.8045999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2240%22%7D%7D\">\u201cAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, an unstable economy and limited labour market opportunities resulted in many highly educated and technologically qualified Russian individuals starting their own cyber-crime activities.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) asserted that the responsibility for the actions of private actors \u2013 both entities and individuals \u2013 might be attributed to the state only if the government executed its effective control over these actors. Since the USA did not have effective control over the paramilitaries in Nicaragua, the ICJ could not find Washington responsible for the activities of the contras (ICJ 1986). Hence, in order for a state to be found responsible for the conduct of private actors under the effective control doctrine, based on the Nicaragua case, it must explicitly delegate at least part of the tasks to such nonstate actors (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The effective control standard was reaffirmed in practice by the Court in the Bosnian Genocide case in 2007 so that Serbia was exculpated from the genocide in Srebrenica (ICJ 2007, paragraph 406). However, in contrast to the effective control doctrine, in its judgment in the Tadic\u0301 case the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the effective control standard is inconsistent with the practice of states and is not in accord with the logic of principles of state responsibility (Tikk et al. 2008: 21). The ICTY (1999) concluded that if a state participates in the organisation and coordination of private actors, in addition to supporting them, it possesses sufficient overall control over them and so the conduct of the non-state actors can be attributed to the state.4\u201d (Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 38)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FY7MY295G%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%2237%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A2%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B97.61419999999998%2C232.08540000000002%2C445.75419999999946%2C240.84540000000004%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C220.9284%2C445.71619999999973%2C229.68840000000003%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C209.7714%2C445.72919999999965%2C218.53140000000002%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C198.6144%2C445.73519999999974%2C207.3744%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C187.45739999999998%2C445.74019999999916%2C196.2174%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C176.30039999999997%2C445.733199999999%2C185.0604%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C165.14339999999996%2C445.7312000000003%2C173.90339999999998%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C153.98639999999995%2C445.7341999999998%2C162.74639999999997%5D%2C%5B87.69319999999999%2C142.82939999999994%2C445.7331999999996%2C151.58939999999996%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C131.67239999999993%2C445.7222000000002%2C140.43239999999994%5D%2C%5B87.6932%2C120.51539999999993%2C445.70419999999956%2C129.27539999999993%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C109.35839999999993%2C445.71519999999987%2C118.11839999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69320000000008%2C98.20139999999994%2C445.7162000000004%2C106.96139999999994%5D%2C%5B87.69220000000004%2C87.04439999999994%2C445.7551999999996%2C95.80439999999994%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2237%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe doctrine of effective control originated in the International Court of Justice\u2019s Nicaragua case between the Republic of Nicaragua and the USA from 1984.

Introduction"], "paragraph_title": ["Attribution of responsibility for cyber-attacks varies between international law and international relations."], "paragraph_text": ["\u201cAttribution and state responsibility in other contexts than cyber security are amongst the most fully developed concepts in international relations and law. However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations.

However, given the peculiar characteristics of cyberspace, where attributing the cyber-attack to a particular perpetrator can become a highly difficult political issue, there exists only a paucity of well-argued sources that would focus on the key role of indirect evidence. Nevertheless, the debate on the topic has been evolving quickly lately and there are certain works which deserve to be highlighted at this point. The most significant contribution in this regard is, without hesitation, Tallinn Manual 2.0 by Professor Michael Schmitt (2017) and his team of experts, who, among other things, formulated several rules for attribution of cyber operations by various actors and, subsequently, state responsibility for such operations. Although the rules of Tallinn Manual 2.0 are non-binding, the book is, to date, one of the most authoritative sources in legal writing on how international law applies to cyber operations. Recent works by Professor Nicholas Tsagourias (2016) and Kubo Mac\u030c\u00e1k (2016) must also be mentioned as valuable contributions to the latest debate on non-state actors and attribution. Two studies by Richard Andres and Scott Shackelford (2010\u20132011) and Jason Healey (2011) should be mentioned too as they address the threshold of proof necessary to constitute responsibility, which is important for this study. Still, none of these most recent works on attribution and state responsibility addresses the importance of indirect evidence enough and thus, this article aspires to contribute to filling the above-described gap in the literature.\u201d</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-citation=\"%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FZHHMAL3L%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2236%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D\">(<span class=\"citation-item\">Kadlecov\u00e1, 2018, p. 36</span>)</span></p>\n</blockquote>"], "metadata": [{"authors": "Lucie Kadlecov\u00e1", "date": "2018", "journal": "Mezin\u00e1rodn\u00ed Vztahy", "title": "State Responsibility in the Cyber Age: The Course towards Indirect Evidence", "abstract": "The problem of attributing responsibility for cyber-attacks is almost as old as cyberspace itself, yet it remains one of the most troublesome issues of that domain. It is often impossible to uncover direct evidence that would reveal the identities of the attackers. Investigators must therefore rely on other, more indirect avenues of proof. The aim of this exploratory study is to develop a basic categorisation of indirect evidence that can be used to attribute state responsibility for cyber-attacks in international relations. To do so, the article works with international legal concepts but transposes them into the analysis of international relations. The categorization of indirect proof is based on the Russian-Georgian conflict of 2008, which provides one of the richest arrays of this kind of evidence. The analysis identifies four kinds of indirect evidence: level of coordination, level of preparedness, state relations with the national hacker community, and state conception of cyber-security.", "doi": "10.32422/mv.1585", "item_type": "journalArticle", "url": "https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/state-responsibility-cyber-age-course-towards/docview/2168814305/se-2?accountid=14511", "conferenceName": null, "pages": "35-46", "short_title": "", "item_id": "ZHHMAL3L", "citation_key": "kadlecovaStateResponsibilityCyber2018", "attachment": {"href": "https://api.zotero.org/users/9047943/items/Y7MY295G", "type": "application/json", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 132136}}], "keywords": ["#attribution_of_cyber_operations #state_responsibility #indirect_evidence #cyber_security #Tallinn_Manual_20 #Michael_Schmitt #Nicholas_Tsagourias #Kubo_Mac\u030c\u00e1k #Richard_Andres #Scott_Shackelford #Jason_Healey #rules_for_attribution #non-binding_rules"], "score": [4.0]}}
