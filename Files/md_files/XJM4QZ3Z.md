# <h1>Proving a State's Involvement in a Cyber-Attack: Evidentiary Standards before the ICJ</h1>

## 1. Introduction

### The frequency and impact of cyber operations have risen significantly since the Internet emerged.

> “Since the emergence of the Internet in the 1980s, various actors – both private and governmental – became the target of foreign cyber operations.1 While thus being a ‘relatively’ new phenomenon in our society, it is unquestionable that their frequency and impact is rising with each year. This is owed to the fact that nowadays, individuals, private companies and governments increasingly and more intensely operate online.2” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)

## 1. Introduction

### Cyber attacks have targeted government infrastructures, exemplified by notable incidents in Estonia, Georgia, and the United States.

> “Cyber operations targeted against states themselves generally aim to bring down governmental infrastructures, such as computer systems of institutions and governmental web pages. This has occurred, for instance, in Estonia and Georgia, where several facilities were brought down through so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.3 Another operation that has created widespread interest among international lawyers and remains heavily debated is the cyber hack into the emails of the US Democratic National Committee during the 2016 US presidential elections. One of the most recent large-scale cyber operations was the so-called NotPetya attack on 27 June 2017, targeting primarily Ukraine.4 However, the most consequential cyber operation so far remains the 2010 attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility plant, which is believed to have been carried out by Israel and the US. Through an infected USB device, it allegedly led to the physical damage of a significant number of centrifuges.5” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 76)

## 1. Introduction

### Attributing cyber attacks to specific states remains challenging, complicating accountability and state responsibility.

> “As demonstrated above, the methods of launching a cyber-attack may vary in many ways (be it a DDoS attack or infiltration of malicious software). Nevertheless, all cyber-attacks so far have had one thing in common: the attacker was and remains fairly difficult to determine. As a consequence, it appears that cyber operations may gradually be seen as a new and viable method through which states are able to inflict harm upon other states, enabling them to ‘hide behind their proxy servers’ while reaching their objectives.6 This results from the immense technical difficulties in attributing cyber operations to other states – also due to the possibility to conceal traces by methods such as IP spoofing – essentially giving states ‘impunity in cyberspace’.7 Therefore, victim states are often left unable to evince the origins of the act, making it impossible to persuasively attribute a wrongful act to another state. These factual difficulties, however, have significant legal consequences, especially because they will most certainly prevent state responsibility from being triggered, which thus gradually undermines the international legal order. Thus, although victim states often have at least an educated guess on the identity of the actual perpetrator, they remain reluctant to point fingers. And while some states have publicly accused other states for cyber operations in the past,8 so far none has resorted to international litigation in an attempt to pursue reparation. In fact, to date there has not been a single dispute on this issue brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ).” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 77)

## 1. Introduction

### The paper explores how past ICJ case law might guide responses to state responsibility for injuries from cyber-attacks.

> “This contribution therefore explores how far the past case law of the ICJ gives guidance on how it might deal with a case concerning state responsibility for an injury arising out of a cyber-attack.9” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 77)

## 1. Introduction

### The article defines cyber-attacks as state-operated intrusions and outlines the focus on evidentiary issues related to these attacks.

> “For the purpose of this article, cyber-attacks shall be considered to constitute any state-operated hostile intrusion into the cyber facilities of another state.10 Thus, the focus lies solely on cyber activities conducted by a state targeting another state.11 This contribution, however, will not delve into issues that might arise out of the law of armed conflict.12 In section 2, this article starts with illustrating evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber operations exemplified by Estonia and Georgia – two states that have been suffering under relatively harmful DDoS attacks. Thereafter, in section 3, the contribution provides a general overview over the ICJ’s past jurisprudence on its evidentiary standards and clarifies the standards the Court has required in the past for the establishment of certain breaches of international law. In particular, two possible breaches, the violation of the use of force principle and the prohibition of non-intervention and their attribution to a state are of interest in the case of cyber-attacks. In this context, the present authors will also address the newest large-scale cyber operations and conclude if they could be considered a violation of these two principles (section 4). Thereafter, the specific standard of proof required by the Court when examining the violation of the prohibition of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, as well as the burden of proof, will be addressed in more detail. Finally, in section 5, already suggested solutions by legal scholars to overcome evidentiary difficulties related to cyber-attacks will be analysed: shifting the burden of proof and lowering the evidentiary standard used by the Court (sections 5.1 and 5.2). The present authors will additionally address a significant topic that has been disregarded so far, namely the extremely difficult task to collect sufficient evidence in the cyber-context. Thus, without the Court’s involvement, it is the authors’ contention that it would be almost impossible for states to meet the required evidentiary standard (section 5.3).” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 78)atum deleniti atque corrupti, quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint, qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt.

## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia

### attacks are increasingly threatening states reliant on digital networks.

> “In the current cyberspace era, where societies are more and more reliant on computer networks, cyber-attacks are becoming an ever-growing threat.13 As Roscini rightly pointed out: ‘The more digitally reliant a state is, the more vulnerable to cyber attacks: if computer systems become the society’s ‘nerve system’, incapacitating them may mean paralyzing the country.’14” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 79)

## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia

### Estonia's DDoS attacks in 2007 highlighted vulnerabilities linked to political tensions with Russia.

> “The weakness of a state, which is highly dependent on computer networks and electronic information, was best observed in Estonia, when it was the target of several DDoS attacks15 in 2007.16 In what was one of the most prominent cyber-attacks in history to date, several Estonian governmental web pages and services became victims of DDoS attacks.17 The series of attacks, which lasted about three weeks, also targeted the Estonian banking system and media, including newspapers and TV stations, as well as other companies.18 Interestingly, the operation occurred closely after the Estonian Government decided to remove a Soviet Second World War memorial from the Tallinn city centre, which led to protests of Russian youth groups and vocal opposition by the Russian Government itself.19 Due to the political circumstances and the fact that some of the attacks could be traced back to IP addresses of Russian state institutions, Estonia accused Russia of the operation.20 Russia, however, denied any involvement and responsibility for the attacks and eventually, Estonia backed away from its accusations.21 Similarly, the DDoS attacks conducted against Georgia in 2008 could, to some extent, be traced back to IP addresses belonging to Russian stateoperated companies.22 The attacks happened at the time where Georgia was already involved in an armed conflict with Russia over South Ossetia.23 While Georgia tried to hold on to the region, Russia supported it in its aim to become independent.24” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 80)

## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia

### attacks to Russia in Estonia and Georgia lacked sufficient evidence.

> “Both attacks were merely accompanied by circumstantial evidence.25 In order to successfully claim Russia’s involvement, the tense political climate between both Georgia and Russia as well as Estonia and Russia was brought forward in combination with the fact that the attack could be tracked back to Russian IP addresses.26 However, neither Estonia nor Georgia could provide essential evidence in order to attribute those cyber operations to Russia.27 What is more, many experts do not believe that Russian authorities were behind the Georgian attacks, but want to attribute them rather to Russian patriotic hackers.28” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 80)

## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia

### attacks is complicated by tactics like IP spoofing, complicating the accountability of states.

> “While technical attribution is very helpful in the determination of the originator of an attack, it cannot provide perfect accuracy.29 First, the actual attacker can make attribution30 very difficult and conceal his/her paths and traces through tactics like IP spoofing, botnets31 or ‘onion routing’.32 Through IP spoofing, for instance, individual hackers might try to feign their identity and erroneously attribute cyber-attacks to an innocent state.33 Hackers can also use computer networks over the whole world to launch an attack, and as data goes through various countries, it is even more difficult to identify one single state as responsible for the cyber operation.34 For instance, 85,000 computers from 178 different countries carried out the DDoS attacks against Estonia.35” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 81)

## 2. Cyber-Attacks and Evidentiary Difficulties: Estonia and Georgia

### attack damages may seek to invoke international responsibility, contingent on proving state involvement.

> “If a state suffers damage from a cyber-attack like Estonia, where damage amounted to tens of millions of euros,36 and if it can be established that the attack constitutes an internationally wrongful act (eg an unlawful intervention),37 one would think that it might have an interest in invoking state responsibility for its injury before the ICJ. In this case, the victim state would have to provide evidence in support of its claim, namely that a specific state was behind the cyber-attack which is consequently obligated to make reparation under the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Despite the fact that the Court has not dealt with a dispute concerning cyber-attacks yet, it was nevertheless already confronted with difficult fact-finding. Therefore, the next section will deal with a general analysis on the standard of proof which the ICJ will require in a proceeding tto successfully attribute an internationally wrongful act to the perpetrator.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 81)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### A victim state must provide persuasive evidence to establish state responsibility.

> “In order to invoke state responsibility, a victim state needs evidence to 1) establish the material elements of the wrongful act, as well as 2) attribute this act to the alleged perpetrator.38 In general, such evidence needs to be persuasive in order to satisfy the court/tribunal of the truthfulness of its allegation.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 81)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The ICJ’s case law has identified three distinct standards for state responsibility.

> “This section will show that, concerning the responsibility of states, the ICJ’s case law indicates that three different types of standards can be distinguished. All of them will be explained below.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 82)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The ICJ has wide discretion in determining evidentiary standards.

> “Before examining the evidentiary standards, it is important to highlight that the Court generally enjoys wide discretion in matters of evidence.39 Neither the Statute nor the Rules of Court contain formal rules regarding the Court’s handling of evidence and in particular, the evaluation of the probative value of evidence submitted by the parties.40 Accordingly, Article 58(2) Rules of Court only stipulates that ‘[...] the method of handling the evidence [...] shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained [...].’41 The Rules of the Court, equally, do not mention which standard of proof has to be applied by the Court nor which methods of proof (eg documentary evidence) are persuasive enough to the ICJ to meet a certain standard.42 This wide discretionary power, therefore, not only applies to fact-finding in general, but also to the Court’s choice of the appropriate evidentiary standard in a given case.43” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 82)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The burden of proof must be clearly established before determining the standard of proof.

> “When discussing the standard of proof, however, it is inevitable to discuss the issue of burden of proof beforehand.44 Most importantly, the two should not be confused. Burden of proof means that the party who asserts a fact in the proceeding is also the party who bears the burden of proving it,45 namely ‘to convince the Court of the truthfulness of its claim’.46 Only after it becomes clear which party bears the burden of proof, the Court is called upon to decide on the necessary standard.47 In this sense, the standard of proof stipulates which degree of probability has to be provided by the party to convince the Court48 or more specifically, the quantum of proof that has to be shown in order to ‘[...] discharge the burden of proof when that burden rests upon [that party]’.49 Looking at the rare amount of cases where the ICJ has touched upon the question of evidentiary standards, it becomes evident that there is not a single standard for all disputes arising before it.50 In cases concerning state responsibility,51 the actual standard of proof in a given case is determined by the substantive nature of the obligation, which was breached and is claimed by a party.52” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 83)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The ICJ requires different evidentiary standards based on the gravity of the charges.

> “The fact that the Court requires different evidentiary standards depending on the level of seriousness of the breach became most evident in its Bosnian Genocide judgment.53 In that case, the Court highlighted the difference between proving the commission of genocide and proving the failure to prevent genocide, as well as to punish and extradite persons charged with the crime of genocide.54 While the Court stated that it requires fully conclusive evidence for charges of exceptional gravity and has to be fully convinced that the act of genocide was committed by the respondent, it pointed out that it ‘only’ requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation for other charges than of exceptional gravity.55 This was the case with proving that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia failed to prevent the commission of genocide,56 which is consequently a less severe violation of international law compared to the commission of genocide. Accordingly, Judge Greenwood pointed out that if cases exist where a state claims charges of exceptional gravity against another state, there have to be cases where a party claims less serious breaches and in those disputes, a lower standard of proof would be appropriate.57 While the Bosnian Genocide case clearly shows that the ICJ requires a higher degree of certainty for serious charges, it is more difficult to perceive the exact difference between – in what seems like – a variety of evidentiary standards mentioned in the Court’s other case law. This is exemplified by the Court’s approach to use terms such as ‘convincing/convinced’,58 ‘conclusive’,59 ‘sufficient’60 and ‘insufficient/not sufficient evidence’61 rather confusable so far instead of explaining which specific standard it applies to find the facts of an allegation established.62 The inconsistency in its method can also be seen in the fact that the ICJ mentions different standards in the same judgment, as can be seen in Corfu Channel.63 Nevertheless, it must be noted that this case is significant in the sense that it helps to identify two standards which are not appropriate in state responsibility cases.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 85)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### Judge Krylov opposed using a probability standard in establishing state responsibility.

> “In his Dissenting Opinion in Corfu Channel, Judge Krylov, for instance, remarkably spoke out against a preponderance of evidence/balance of probabilities standard64 when state responsibility is invoked by a party: ‘One cannot condemn a State on the basis of probabilities. To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.’65” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 85)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### A balance of probabilities standard is inadequate for establishing international responsibility.

> “In the authors’ opinion, this seems plausible. The application of a balance of probabilities standard essentially means that the truthfulness of an allegation has to be ‘more probable than not’66 compared to the evidence submitted by the alleged perpetrator. This, however, cannot suffice to establish international responsibility convincingly. Such a low standard might very easily lead to a false attribution of internationally wrongful acts, which ultimately were not committed by the state, although it might indeed seem this way.67 Accordingly, it is important to highlight that the Court itself never used a balance of probabilities standard with regard to a state responsibility case.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 85)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### Proof beyond reasonable doubt is not typically required by the ICJ for state responsibility.

> “The Corfu Channel case also indicates that proof beyond reasonable doubt, a standard applied in national and international cases concerning the criminal responsibility of individuals,68 is not an appropriate standard before the ICJ, even if charges against a state are of exceptional gravity.69 However, where such a grave breach is alleged, the Court does require a relatively high degree of certainty, namely fully conclusive evidence. Consequently, in Corfu Channel, the Court has not found that the UK met this high standard when claiming that the minefield was laid with the connivance of Albania.70 This finding was later confirmed in Bosnian Genocide, where the Court equally refrained from applying the proof beyond reasonable doubt standard.71” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 86)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### Circumstantial evidence must leave no room for reasonable doubt.

> “However, the foregoing only applies to claims for which direct proof is available.72 Where mere circumstantial evidence is submitted by a party, the ICJ did require that proof must leave no room for reasonable doubt.73 Again, the ICJ determined the exact parameters in Corfu Channel, when it noted with regards to the claim brought forward by the UK that Albania knew about the minefield in its territorial waters: [...] the fact of this exclusive territorial control exercised by a State within its frontiers has a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events. By reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. [...] The proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt.74” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 86)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The ICJ held that circumstantial evidence can support claims if direct evidence is unavailable.

> “Essentially, the ICJ held on the basis of circumstantial evidence – meaning facts which considered together lead ‘logically to a single conclusion’ – that Albania must have known about the mines in the Corfu Channel.75 Where the Court allows recourse to indirect evidence, this only being the case where direct evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other party and circumstantial evidence does not ‘contradict’ any existing direct proof,76 the standard will be elevated to proof beyond reasonable doubt.77 In two other cases, Oil Platforms and Armed Activities, where the violation of the prohibition of the use of force was claimed respectively, the ICJ applied a clear and convincing standard.78 Additionally, the Court also mentioned several times that the submitted evidence was either sufficient79 or insufficient.80 In Nicaragua, the Court merely noted that there was insufficient evidence to prove ‘various points’ but abstained from establishing a certain standard of proof, which needed to be met by the parties.81” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 87)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The evidentiary standards used by the ICJ remain unclear and inconsistent.

> “It is not clear, however, how the evidentiary standards mentioned by the ICJ in those cases exactly differ from each other and how, in the end, they are decisive for the Court in the determination of the amount of proof the party has to provide in order to discharge its burden.82” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 87)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### Commentators have attempted to delineate between various evidentiary standards used by the ICJ.

> “Consequently, commentators have tried to highlight the differences between those standards by, inter alia, referring to their ordinary meaning as referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary.83 In doing so, they established a hierarchy between the terms conclusive, convincing and sufficient, with conclusive being the highest of the three standards.84 What is more, the lack of precise definitions for the different evidentiary standards, and especially the reluctance of international courts from discussing the standards they use85 may also be ascribed to the influence of the civil/continental law – as opposed to common law – tradition on inter-state dispute settlement.86 In the civil law system, judges determine the probative value of submitted evidence in both civil, and criminal law cases based on their internal conviction and are thus not required to apply a specific standard.87 In common law jurisdictions, however, judges generally apply the preponderance of evidence or reasonable degree of probability standard with regard to civil law cases, whereas in criminal law cases, a higher standard, namely proof beyond reasonable doubt, has to be met.88 Above all, many difficulties when determining evidentiary standards arise due to the simple fact that the evaluation of evidence is a subjective matter – ultimately leading to contradictions between judges on what kind of evidence suffices to be convincing to discharge the burden.89” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 88)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### The ICJ’s standards for evidence need clearer definitions for parties involved in proceedings.

> “However, it would still be important to know for parties what the ICJ itself exactly means by conclusive, convincing and sufficient evidence.90 What is more, the parties appearing before the Court should, already during the proceedings, have at least some clue as to which evidentiary standard will be applied to the case and not be taken by surprise by the Court’s final judgment.91 Particularly in Bosnian Genocide, however, the Court already went a step further by giving more detailed answers than in previous cases and hopefully will continue to develop the case law more consistently with regard to the question of evidentiary standards.92”

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### Legal scholars identify three standards of proof in ICJ state responsibility cases.

> “In conclusion, legal scholars have identified three types of state responsibility cases before the ICJ when it comes to determining the relevant standard of proof.93 First, in regular cases, the ICJ demands proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.94 The amount of certainty the Court generally requires in those cases seems to be clear and convincing evidence by parties.95 Second, the Court requires a higher standard of proof/higher degree of certainty for cases where charges of exceptional gravity are claimed by a party against another state.96 Here, the Court needs to be fully convinced that a state has actually committed the breach of an obligation.97 In other words, the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be on the truthfulness of the claim.98 Third, where states are only able to provide circumstantial evidence, this being the case where direct evidence is absent and the Court draws inferences from facts, it ultimately requires the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.99” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 89)

## Evidentiary Standards before the International Court of Justice

### case basis based on the seriousness of the allegation.

> “The ICJ’s case law so far clearly shows that it adopts the relevant standard of proof on a case-by-case basis, appropriate to the circumstances and seriousness of the allegation.100 The next step in this contribution is, therefore, to examine which internationally wrongful act states may want to attribute to other states before the ICJ, as far as cyber-attacks are concerned. This makes it then possible to explore the level of seriousness of the alleged breach in order to determine the evidentiary standard which has to be met by the parties in the dispute.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 89)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts

### attacks must violate international law to warrant adjudication.

> “Cyber-attacks may vary greatly in scale and form. However, only when these ‘hostile uses of cyberspace’101 amount to a violation of international law, the question of international adjudication arises.102 In the authors’ opinion, the international obligations most relevant for a cyber-attack to constitute an internationally wrongful act are those that most severely infringe a state’s sovereignty. Thus, the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the principle of non-intervention and their applicability to cyber operations are of special interest. Based on these two principles, the question of how to attribute these ‘attacks’ to a state will be examined and the necessary standard of proof to be applied in those cases will be determined. It is also important to note that the term cyber-‘attack’, being a non-legal term, is not to be equated to the term ‘armed attack’, triggering the right of self-defence under Article 51 UN Charter.103” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 90)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.1. The Threat or Use of Force

### Cyber operations can be classified as a use of force if they have severe effects comparable to traditional warfare.

> “Due to its severity, the first international obligation to be discussed here is the prohibition of the threat or use of force, enshrined in Article 2(4) UN Charter.104 This prohibition is considered to be a norm of customary international law105 and the overall consensus is that it is also applicable to cyber operations.106 This is in line with the ICJ’s Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, where it noted that the prohibition to use force applies ‘regardless of the weapons employed’.107 It is more the effect of a weapon upon which a breach of Article 2(4) is determined.108 Traditionally, only physical damage to property, loss of life or injury of persons were thought to meet this requirement.109 Moreover, a state would need to prove that the cyber-attack has caused a severe effect, meaning that ‘its scale and effects are comparable to non-cyber operations rising to the level of a use of force’.110 Given the virtual (rather than physical) nature of cyber-attacks, this seems to be the most difficult part.111 To give an example of such severity, the Stuxnet virus launched at the Iranian Natanz nuclear plant, supposedly leading to the physical damage of the plant’s centrifuges could be considered, if proven, to be of such gravity that it would constitute a use of force.112 Another attack worth mentioning in this regard is the recent NotPetya operation at the end of June this year. It was initially thought to be a ransomware attack,113 but then later qualified as being more than that, as the generation of revenue did not seem to be the primary goal of its operation.114 It also led to chaos on a large scale, with Ukraine seeming to be the main target.115 Despite the fact that physical damage did not occur, the NotPetya operation may nevertheless open up the discussion as to whether non-destructive cyber operations, which still massively disrupt the apparatus of the state, might be considered a violation of Article 2(4) in the future.116” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 91)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.1. The Threat or Use of Force

### attacks with traditional uses of force.

> “To conclude, there seems to be a relatively high threshold of invoking the violation of Article 2(4), since the damage must be so severe it can be equated to a use of force in the traditional sense. Thus, in the case of less than forceful cyber-attacks or general lack of evidence, a state might have more success in claiming that the cyber intrusion constituted an unlawful intervention.117” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 91)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.2. Non-Intervention

### attacks as unlawful interference in state affairs.

> “The principle of non-intervention derived out of the principle of the sovereign equality of states, which is enshrined in Article 2(1) UN Charter.118 It also reflects customary international law.119 It is widely seen to be equally applicable to cyber-attacks.120 According to the ICJ, a state’s coercive interference in another state’s internal affairs constitutes an unlawful intervention.121 The Court noted in the Nicaragua judgment, that the requirement of coercion is fulfilled, when a state is deprived of its free ‘choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’.122 The most obvious form of such coercion, according to the ICJ, is an intervention that uses force.123 Being a much broader obligation than the prohibition of threat or use of force, it thus prohibits both forceful and less than forceful operations.124” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 92)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.2. Non-Intervention

### Coercive cyber operations, even without severe damage, can be considered unlawful interventions.

> “Having determined previously that severe damage is needed to establish a use of force, less than forceful – but still coercive – cyber operations might thus still be unlawful. To give an example, the cyber-attack against Estonia in 2007 (if it is assumed that it was conducted by Russia) could be seen as an unlawful intervention in Estonia’s affairs, as it was a coercive attempt to influence Estonia not to relocate the Second World War memorial.125” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 92)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.2. Non-Intervention

### intervention principle, but proving coercion is challenging.

> “More recently, the hack and release of a vast amount of internal emails of the US Democratic National Committee to WikiLeaks right before the US elections has sparked widespread media attention. It primarily led to the increased negative portrayal of candidate Clinton in the media and is widely believed to have been conducted by the Russian Government in order to help candidate Trump win the presidency.126 Another consequential hack was the attack against President Macron’s election campaign, which led to the release of thousands of emails and documents related to the campaign.127 Some cybersecurity research firms linked the attack to the same Russianaffiliated hackers that were involved in the hack before the US elections.128 In this regard, the Tallinn Manual129 notes under Rule 10 that ‘the [coercive] manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections’ constitutes a prohibited intervention.130 It thus might be plausible to assume that these cyber operations – the US and France hacks – might constitute a violation of the principle of non-intervention.131 Note, however, that this remains a heavily debated issue, especially due to the fact that the necessary element of coercion to establish such a violation is very difficult to prove.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 93)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.3. Attribution

### Attribution of wrongful conduct to a state is essential for state responsibility.

> “Eventually, for state responsibility to arise, the wrongful conduct must be attributable to a state. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility set out in Articles 4 to 11 the different activities by individuals which are attributable to a state. These include first and foremost the conduct of de jure and de facto state organs as well as persons/entities ‘exercising elements of governmental authority’.132” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 93)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.3. Attribution

### Private hackers can be attributed to state actions if they operate under state control.

> “Particular notice shall be made to private hackers, whose expertise might be used by states to conduct a cyber-attack. Two provisions of the ILC Articles might be of relevance in this regard. First, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that Article 4 ILC Articles might enable the attribution of acts of private individuals that are not formally recognised as state organs to the state, if they are ‘in a relationship of complete dependence on the State’.133 Proving a complete dependence, however, might be very difficult. Thus, according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,134 the conduct of private individuals may still be attributable to a state if they are either acting under the instructions of that state or under their direction or control.135 In the Nicaragua judgment, the ICJ determined the degree of control to be one of effective control ‘in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred’.136 The ICTY’s Appeals Chamber argued in Tadić that its ‘overall control’ test, which was a test to establish the internationality of a conflict, would be equally applicable to questions of state responsibility.137 This, however, was rejected by the ICJ in Bosnian Genocide, which considered the test to be too broad to apply it to the context of Article 8 and upheld its reasoning from Nicaragua.138 This stricter test, however, poses another difficulty for an injured state, since proving effective control is a much higher threshold than claiming overall control of a state over the activities of a non-state actor.139” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 94)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.3. Attribution

### Victim states must prove the affiliation or control of individuals to attribute cyber-attacks to states.

> “Therefore, in order to attribute an act to a state, the ‘victim’ state would need to prove that the cyber-attack was launched from a device that belonged to someone who was either completely dependent on that state or his/her activities were somehow conducted under effective control of that state.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 94)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.3. Attribution

### Attribution of cyber-attacks to specific territories is complicated by technological obfuscation.

> “Setting aside this high threshold of proving an individual’s affiliation with the state, the attribution to a specific territory itself proves already extremely difficult. To start with, one may have to identify the exact location of the device. In the simplest cases, this could be achieved by tracing back the IP address from which the attack was launched.140 Thus, if the IP address reveals a government-owned facility, the device can be identified as a government computer and thus, state responsibility may arise.141 However, as explained in section 2 in more detail, there are many ways to obscure the identity of the actual perpetrator, eg through IP spoofing, or computer hijacking. Moreover, the Tallinn Manual notes that ‘the fact that a cyber operation has been routed via the cyber infrastructure located in a State’ does not constitute ‘sufficient evidence’ that the cyber activity is attributable to that state.142 And, even if an attack could be traced back to a specific governmental computer infrastructure, this is only an indication which government was behind the attack.143 Thus, attribution in the context of cyberspace proves extremely difficult.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 95)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)

### The applicability of proving a state's breach of nonintervention principles in cyber context is questioned.

> “Having demonstrated the various hurdles of applying the principle of nonintervention and Article 2(4) to the cyber context, the question now remains whether the current regime of proving a state’s breach of these principles remains applicable. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that the material elements of a breach (such as coercion or severe damage) are sufficiently proven. Of particular interest is the question of proving the attribution of the attack to a state. For that as well, however, two main elements of proof need to be considered: the burden and the standard of proof.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 95)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)4.4.1. Burden of Proof

### The burden of proof in ICJ proceedings rests with the party asserting a fact.

> “It is important to note that the formal status of the parties in the proceedings, whether applicant or respondent, has no bearing on the allocation of the burden.144 When asserting which party carries the burden of proof, the Court generally applies the onus probandi incumbit actori principle: It is the party asserting a fact that is responsible for providing the Court with proof thereof.145 The allocation of the burden of proof is of fundamental importance since there can only be a decision in favour of a party that has to prove a certain fact when it has successfully discharged the burden.146 Thus, if a state wants to successfully claim reparations for a state’s violations of the threat or use of force and non-intervention principle, it is up to the victim state to collect enough evidence to discharge the burden. The onus probandi rule, however, is not an absolute one, the determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subjectmatter and nature of each dispute brought before the Court; it varies according to the type of facts which it is necessary to establish for the purpose of the decision of this case.147” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 96)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4)4.4.1. Burden of Proof

### The obligation of states to disclose evidence remains a debated issue linked to the burden of proof.

> “The question whether or not a state is under a general duty to disclose all relevant evidence that may be solely in its possession, is also closely linked to the burden of proof and to this date remains the subject of significant scholarly debate. Even if a state could successfully trace back IP addresses to another government’s computer infrastructures, it would not have access to these computers in the same way as the perpetrator state. While some argue for the general notion that states need to act in good faith when participating in a judicial procedure,148 with regard to the wording of Article 49 of the Court’s Statute (‘formal note shall be taken of any refusal’), this provision for the production of evidence does not seem to imply a binding legal obligation for states to comply with Article 49 requests.149 While the Court might be allowed to draw adverse inferences from not complying with such a request (even though it has been reluctant to do so in the past), this does not mean it could compel a party to produce evidence.150 It can therefore be assumed that an argument for the non-binding nature of Article 49 requests stands on stronger footing.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 96)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4):4.4.2. Standard of Proof

### The ICJ requires the same standard of proof for both attribution and violations in cyber-attacks.

> “Due to the technical difficulty of attributing a cyber-attack, it might be argued that different standards of proof shall apply for the attribution on the one hand and claiming the substantive violation on the other. For attribution, certain scholars refer to the Yeager arbitration.151 There, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal noted that the attribution of a wrongful conduct to a state must be proven with reasonable certainty.152 However, the ICJ noted in Bosnian Genocide that the same standard of proof applies to both the violation of the substantive rule as well as the attribution for such acts.153 In other words, rather than separating attribution and violation, both of them require the same standard of proof. Thus, since the standard of proof varies with the violation, the standard of reasonable certainty does not apply to all cases.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 97)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4):4.4.2. Standard of Proof

### The ICJ has set a threshold of clear and convincing evidence for allegations of unlawful force.

> “In Armed Activities and Oil Platforms, the ICJ set the threshold of alleging an unlawful use of force to clear and convincing evidence.154 As noted in section 3, the Court demands the higher standard of fully conclusive evidence only in charges of exceptional gravity. This suggests that the violation of Article 2(4) is not considered to be of such grave nature, which – given that a non-forceful intervention is considered less harmful, must hold true for the principle of non-intervention as well. Consequently, the clear and convincing standard would most likely equally apply to prove an intervention.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 97)

## 4. Cyber-Attacks as Internationally Wrongful Acts:4.4. Proving a State’s Breach of the Prohibition of Non-Intervention and Article 2(4):4.4.2. Standard of Proof

### Circumstantial evidence will often be the only available proof in cyber-attack cases, complicating state attribution.

> “However, especially when alleging a cyber-attack that violated the prohibition of use of force or non-intervention, direct proof will often be missing and thus the only type of evidence the parties may be able to offer is circumstantial evidence.155 In that case, as we have seen before, the proof provided ‘must leave no room for reasonable doubt’.156 However, with current techniques, it is almost impossible to attribute an attack to a state beyond reasonable doubt, especially without giving away specific know-how that might be too delicate to share with the rest of the world.157 Therefore, without lowering the standard to give credit to the special circumstances of cyber-attacks, it will be almost impossible for states to prove the affiliation of a state to the attack. See section 5.2 on this issue.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 97)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace

### attacks exemplify situations with exclusive evidence control and necessitate a reevaluation of evidentiary burdens by the ICJ.

> “Cyber-attacks might to some extent be considered textbook examples of a scenario where one party has exclusive control over the evidence required and where direct proof is often not available.158 Section 5.1 thus seeks to shine some light on whether or not the Court would be inclined to shift the burden of proof in the cyber context. Next, the question whether the ICJ might depart from its strict approach concerning circumstantial evidence will be addressed in section 5.2.159 For both questions, opinions of different legal scholars will be analysed. Finally, as a new way forward to resolve some of the evidentiary issues in the cyber context, the present authors suggest that – as an alternative solution – the Court should make more use of its inherent powers regarding the production of evidence (section 5.3).” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 98)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof

### attack cases due to attribution challenges.

> “As attribution poses one of the biggest problems in the cyber context, some authors have called for a reversal of the burden of proof, even though the reasons for arriving at this conclusion are very different. One of them makes a case for not applying the ICJ’s findings in Corfu Channel, arguing that by their very nature computers are different to sea-mines.160 Therefore, the same standards cannot be applied in the cyber context; hence a reversal of the burden of proof is appropriate.161 For authors dealing with problems like identification or attribution, fairness and efficiency seem to be their focal point for arguing for a reversal of the burden, assuming that the party whose territory the attack has emanated from, has superior access to information.162 Consequently, the onus should be on the country where the attack had been launched from (allegedly).163 Proponents of this approach also put forward that, with a reversal of the burden, states would take their due diligence obligations of preventing cyber-attacks more seriously.164 This is closely linked to the claim that the precautionary principle originating from environmental law can be applied to cyberspace, which then automatically shifts the burden of proof.165 While the application of the precautionary principle might well be appropriate for the cyber context, the ICJ has decidedly rejected that its application would result in a reversal of the burden of proof.166” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 99)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof

### The ICJ has historically been resistant to shifting the burden of proof, as seen in its case law.

> “As already established, it depends on the subject matter and nature of each dispute how the burden of proof is allocated.167 While this could be taken as an argument for a potential reversal of the burden with regard to cyber-attacks, this seems highly unlikely. When looking at the ICJ’s case law, ever since its first decision, the Court has not been inclined to shift the burden, even when evidence was exclusively located in the territory of one state.168 This finding in Corfu Channel has so far not been overruled in any way.169 What is more, the Court reaffirmed its findings in the Nicaragua case, acknowledging that even in times of ongoing armed conflicts (as was the case in eg Georgia in 2008), where evidence might be hard to come by, this might affect the standard of proof, not however the burden.170 Even Judge Owada’s Separate Opinion to the Oil Platforms case dealt with difficulties arising from evidentiary imbalances between the applicant and the respondent in a self-defence scenario, as it was the US’s duty to establish that Iran had launched an armed attack against them, against which they defended themselves. While not wholeheartedly content with the situation, he stated that: Nevertheless, there is no denying the fact that there undoubtedly exists an asymmetry in the situation surrounding the case [...]. I am prepared to accept that this asymmetry is inherent in the circumstances of the present case and there is little the Court can do under the circumstances. It is primarily the task incumbent upon the party which claims certain facts as the basis of its contention to establish them by producing sufficient evidence in accordance with the principle actori incumbit onus probandi.171” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 99)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof

### attack cases due to their complexities.

> “In light of the discussion above, it can be therefore concluded that it is highly unlikely that the ICJ would shift the burden of proof in the cyber context, not only because of the established case law but also because of certain characteristics of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often routed through numerous countries,172 thus a reversal could place the burden of proof on a wholly uninvolved party.173” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.1. Reversing the Burden of Proof

### The Court aims for fairness and may consider lowering evidentiary standards rather than reversing the burden of proof.

> “It is, however, important to note that the Court has always been concerned with a level playing field for the parties, which could not be facilitated by a reversal of the burden. What may however be considered, might be lowering the evidentiary standard to facilitate the discharge of the burden.174” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### The ICJ's evidentiary standard for cyber-attack allegations remains stringent.

> “As was already explained above, the ICJ seems to have a case-to-case approach for the evidentiary standard to be applied. This makes it incredibly difficult for the parties to assess how much evidence is needed to successfully discharge the burden. However, there are certain signpost judgments shining light on an expected standard to be met (such as Armed Activities or Oil Platforms in the case of claiming use of force).175 As was already mentioned in section 4.4.b), it only seems logical to assume that the party alleging such violations in the form of a cyber-attack would need to meet the same clear and convincing evidentiary standard.176 Some authors regard this standard as still too high, deeming it as too strict and advocating for the lower balance of probabilities standard.177” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 100)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### The ICJ is unlikely to lower the evidentiary standard below 'clear and convincing'.

> “However, looking at the ICJ’s previous case law, it is very unlikely that the Court would apply a lower standard than clear and convincing. In fact, as noted above, the ICJ might even set the standard to proof beyond reasonable doubt, since direct proof will often be missing.178 This, however, would set the standard for cyber-attacks incredibly high. On the other hand, it would do away with concerns that a lower evidentiary standard would make it easier to blame a state for conduct it had nothing to do with. Protecting the respondent from false attribution, be it through IP spoofing, botnets or onion routing,179 is an argument that should not be left out of the debate concerning a lower evidentiary standard.180” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 101)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### Applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in cyber contexts may be impractical.

> “However, applying a beyond reasonable doubt standard in the cyber context might also be too far reaching: With regard to cyber-attacks, collecting evidence will always remain extremely hard and it would be (at least at the moment) impossible to collect information that reaches a higher level than clear and convincing.181 The victim state would be left with the impossible task to meet a standard which is ‘unreachable’, which could potentially result in perpetrator states evading their responsibility under international law. As Judge Owada held in his Separate Opinion to Oil Platforms: As a court of justice whose primary function is the proper administration of justice, should see to it that this problem relating to evidence be dealt with in such a way that utmost justice is brought to bear on the final finding of the Court [...] It would seem to me that the only way to achieve this would have been for the Court to take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding in the present case. This brings me to the standard of proof to be required for discharging the burden of proof in a case where the party who carries the burden of proof, though responsible for discharging that burden, finds itself in an extremely difficult situation as seen from an objective point of view.182” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 101)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### The ICJ prioritizes justice over unattainable evidentiary standards.

> “These opinions, however, clearly show that the ICJ itself would not be interested in applying a standard that would be impossible to meet for the parties involved and that the paramount principle underlying the ICJ’s assessment of evidence is the proper administration of justice.183 Such is unlikely when the Court would require parties to prove their allegations beyond reasonable doubt, even when direct proof is not available.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 101)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### The clear and convincing standard balances state protection and proof obligations.

> “This leaves us with the still relatively high clear and convincing standard that effectively protects states from false attribution, while at the same time making it possible to discharge the burden of proof successfully.184” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.2. Lowering the Evidentiary Standard – The Indirect Evidence Dilemma

### States may require ICJ assistance to meet evidence standards due to sovereignty issues.

> “However, it is nevertheless unrealistic to assume that states themselves are able to collect sufficient evidence in order to meet the clear and convincing standard without the Court’s involvement. This, particularly due to the fact that evidence is often located in the exclusive territory of the alleged perpetrator and obtaining said evidence one-sidedly would constitute a violation of that state’s sovereignty.185 The present authors therefore suggest combining the clear and convincing standard with a more enhanced use of the Court’s inherent fact-finding powers. This new approach will be discussed below.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### The section explores how court-appointed experts can help overcome evidentiary hurdles in cyber-attack cases.

> “As discussed above, the present authors propose that the clear and convincing standard would be the best way to aptly deal with the evidentiary difficulties relating to cyber-attacks. Authors such as Roscini and Schmitt have already illustrated quite convincingly why this standard, being still significantly high, would be appropriate.186 However, little has been said so far on how exactly the Court could be furnished with evidence that would satisfy the demands of a clear and convincing standard. Therefore, this section seeks to shine light on how to overcome certain evidentiary hurdles through the Court’s more active usage of its powers to produce evidence. More specifically, it will do so by focusing on the evidentiary power that might become indispensable in these highly scientific and technical matters: the use of court-appointed experts. Before analysing those in detail, however, this section will start with a more general overview on ways to collect evidence in an ICJ proceeding.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 102)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### The ICJ has inherent powers to collect evidence but has been criticized for its reluctance to utilize them.

> “First, in theory, the Court has the inherent power to request additional documents, call its own witnesses, appoint own experts, or make on site visits. This has rarely happened in the past, as the Court has always been of the opinion that parties to the dispute should first and foremost furnish the Court with evidence themselves.187 However, the extremely cautious approach as an intermediary not making use of its powers has been widely criticised.188 For example, in Bosnian Genocide, the Court did not grant an evidentiary request by Bosnia (as according to the Court, they already had extensive evidence in their possession) but then ultimately found that it had not successfully discharged its burden.189 The backlash created by this finding might open up the road to a more proactive stance in the future, particularly in the cyber context.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 103)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### Parties can appoint experts, but the ICJ has criticized past practices that limited cross-examination.

> “Second, the parties can appoint experts according to Articles 57 and 64 Rules of the Court.190 It happened before that scientific experts appeared as counsel for one of the parties, which, however, due to not having been appointed as experts according to the ICJ’s Statute, barred the other party to the proceeding from cross-examining this counsel.191 The Court criticised this approach in Pulp Mills of having limited value.192 This critique seems to have been successful, as in recent cases, such as Whaling, the parties appointed experts according to the Rules, that could be cross-examined by both the Court and other parties.193” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 103)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### Court-appointed experts can reduce bias and enhance the credibility of evidence in technical matters.

> “Lastly, the Court may appoint experts itself. Pursuant to Article 50 of the Statute, ‘[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion’.194 The advantages of using court-appointed experts are manifold, aside from the fact that a potential bias plays less of a role as opposed to party-appointed experts.195 Therefore, the present authors argue that making better usage of the Court’s own powers to appoint experts under Article 50 would help resolve attribution issues in the cyber context.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 103)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### Despite difficulties in summoning experts, their use is increasingly necessary due to technical nature of cases.

> “It is important to note that the Court’s summoning of experts includes significant difficulties (those of a financial nature, among others).196 However, the increasing case load of international tribunals and the growing number of cases of a highly technical nature warrant for a wider use of this device.197 So far, the ICJ and its predecessor have been reluctant to use their powers under Article 50. Only in the Chorzow Factory case in front of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), as well as the Corfu Channel and the Gulf of Maine case in front of the ICJ, experts have been appointed under this procedure.198 This reluctance has been widely criticised not only by doctrine199 but also within the Court.200” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 104)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### Bias concerns and outdated perceptions about expert necessity hinder effective evidence gathering.

> “One explanation for the neglect of Article 50 might be the fact that court-appointed experts almost exclusively appear in civil law jurisdictions and that to jurists from common law backgrounds, this appointment might seem like an undue interference, especially with regard to the burden of proof of the parties.201 It has also been the Court’s contention that the use of experts was just not necessary, as the parties involved in the proceedings seldom disagreed on matters of fact but rather on matters of law.202 This, however, is an outdated notion, as proceedings seem to gradually focus more on scientific and technical questions and the Court is increasingly involved in extensive fact-finding.203 Consequently, particularly due to the specific technical and scientific knowledge required in cyber-related proceedings, judges will not be able to obtain such expertise easily by themselves and reliance on party-appointed experts will likely not yield a satisfactory outcome due to the uncertainty resulting out of their potential bias.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 105)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### Court-appointed experts are crucial in cyber cases because of asymmetric access to information.

> “Another argument in favour of court-appointed experts is that particularly in the cyber context, one party may have superior access to information, or might even be the only one able to access specific documents.204 Also, it is hard to imagine that the decision in a proceeding involving cyber-attacks would not to a large part hinge on the establishment of factual circumstances, as traces can be erased so easily, computers hijacked and so forth. Gaining that kind of knowledge through court-appointed experts seems to be one of the best ways to establish those facts.205” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 105)

## 5. Possible Means to Address the Evidentiary Dilemma in Cyberspace:5.3. The Court’s Powers for the Production of Evidence

### A more active use of the Court’s fact-finding powers could help address evidentiary challenges in cyber contexts.

> “Legal scholar Roscini proposes that the ICJ should use the fact-finding powers mentioned above to counterbalance evidentiary difficulties in cases where an exceptionally high standard has to be met (such as for example ‘fully conclusive’ in the case of genocide).206 However, the present authors argue that – in the cyber context – not even a more proactive stance on fact-finding could produce evidence that meets the requirements of a fully conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt standard. These evidentiary difficulties in the cyber context become clear when comparing a typical cyber scenario to a state responsibility case, where the Court made use of its fact-finding powers. In Corfu Channel, the Court concluded that the exceptionally high standard of beyond reasonable doubt to decide on Albania’s international responsibility was met due to the tests run by court-appointed experts. It might thus be possible for experts to arrive at a single logical conclusion on whether an Albanian coastguard would have been able to see a ship passing through in the dark.207 This, however, cannot be said for experts having to determine whether an attack, which was routed through multiple countries, was caused by a specific state. Not even the biggest team of experts could furnish the Court with evidence that simply does not exist. This is why the present authors propose that the best way to overcome evidentiary problems in the cyber context would be a more active use of the Court’s fact-finding powers to reach the lower, but still satisfying clear and convincing standard. The fact that the Court has recently appointed experts in the Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the first appointment in over 30 years – might be an indicator that the Court is about to change its reluctant stance on Article 50.208” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 106)

## 6. Conclusion

### States are likely to seek ICJ intervention for cyber-attack damages.

> “It is probably only a matter of time until a state lodges an application before the ICJ, claiming that it suffered damage arising out of a cyber-attack. It is almost certain that the Court will then be faced with several new questions, starting with whether a specific cyber-attack amounts to a violation of international law, to whether the current regime of evidentiary standards employed by the Court so far gives credit to the specific technical difficulties of proving cyber-attacks. As demonstrated by Estonia and Georgia, this contribution displayed the severe evidentiary troubles victim states have faced so far when trying to prove a state’s involvement and thus, arguably, a reluctance to address international tribunals in this matter.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 106)

## 6. Conclusion

### The ICJ applies varying evidentiary standards based on claim severity.

> “First, the present authors started with analysing the current evidentiary regime of the Court to shine light on this delicate topic. It became clear that when dealing with state responsibility, the Court has applied three different standards. These vary according to the seriousness of the claim. Thus, for charges of exceptional gravity, for example, it found that it must be convinced by fully conclusive evidence.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 106)

## 6. Conclusion

### A breach of international obligation is essential for establishing proof standards in cyber contexts.

> “Therefore, there must be a breach of an international obligation first, in order to assess what standard of proof the Court will most likely apply in the cyber context. Consequently, the present authors analysed two principles of international law that are most probable to be violated in the case of a cyberattack against a state: the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the non-intervention principle: two principles, that by their very nature want to protect a state’s territorial integrity.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 106)

## 6. Conclusion

### Technical difficulties complicate proving state involvement in cyber-attacks.

> “Although the Court already held that it will require clear and convincing evidence when a breach of Article 2(4) – and most likely also an unlawful intervention – is claimed, this only applies when direct proof is available. Nowadays, where technical difficulties hinder states to gather evidence linking a state directly to a cyber-attack, only indirect evidence can be submitted. In such a case, however, the Court established that it will require proof beyond reasonable doubt to let international responsibility arise. It is very likely that the ICJ will face various problems with this standard. Above all, a victim state would be left having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a state is the originator of an attack. This is something that is obviously impossible with our current technical expertise.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 107)

## 6. Conclusion

### Shifting the burden of proof could be inadequate, and lower standards may enhance justice.

> “Thus, scholars have proposed to shift the burden of proof to the perpetrator state, which now has to prove that it had not been involved in a cyberattack. This seems to be an unsatisfying solution: Not only did the Court itself refuse such an approach in the past; a shift would also put too much responsibility on the respondent state. Therefore, a more plausible approach would be to lower the evidentiary standard to clear and convincing, even in cases where direct proof is missing. Additionally, the present authors have pointed out how the inability of the parties to produce sufficient evidence can be overcome through the usage of the Court’s power to appoint experts. This makes it possible to meet the clear and convincing standard and thus establish international responsibility.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 107)

## 6. Conclusion

### The ICJ is expected to be flexible with evidentiary standards in attribution cases.

> “To conclude, the relevant case law so far suggests that the Court will remain flexible in its application of evidentiary standards. It will be seen whether it may be open to lowering the standard in cases of exceptional difficulty. In this way, it could ensure that in each individual case, the appropriate standard to enable attribution is applied, but still protects states from wrongful conviction.” (Brunner et al., 2019, p. 107)
