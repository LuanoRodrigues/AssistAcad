# <h1>Attribution, delayed attribution and covert cyber-attack. Under what conditions should the United States publicly acknowledge responsibility for cyber operations …</h1>

## 1.1 Research Framework

### The thesis examines the U.S. attribution posture regarding responsibility for cyberspace operations.

> 'The primary research question raised in this thesis concerns the attribution posture the United States should adopt in acknowledging responsibility for cyberspace operations.' (McDade, 2014, p. 1)

## 1.1 Research Framework

### The central research question focuses on the U.S. responsibility in cyberspace operations.

> 'The primary research question raised in this thesis concerns the attribution posture the United States should adopt in acknowledging responsibility for cyberspace operations.' (McDade, 2014, p. 1)

## 1.1 Research Framework

### The research emphasizes the need for a clear attribution posture in cyberspace operations.

> 'The primary research question raised in this thesis concerns the attribution posture the United States should adopt in acknowledging responsibility for cyberspace operations.' (McDade, 2014, p. 1)

## 1.1 Research Framework

### The U.S. risks losing opportunities in deterrence and diplomacy by not pursuing self-attribution.

> 'By not pursuing self-attribution and operating in secrecy, the United States might miss opportunities in deterrence, diplomacy, and foreign policy.' (McDade, 2014, p. 2)

## 1.1 Research Framework

### Responsibility in cyber-attacks using proxies and avoiding attribution needs careful consideration.

> 'If cyber-attack is an action that uses a proxy to achieve stealth and can avoid attribution, what responsibility needs to be taken?' (McDade, 2014, p. 3)

## 1.1 Research Framework

### The thesis aims to provide a strategic and legal framework for key military and defense decision-makers.

> 'This thesis provides key advisors and decision makers in the Navy, U.S. Cyber Command and Department of Defense with a strategic and legal framework.' (McDade, 2014, p. 11)

## 1.2 Key Findings

### Self-attribution may be strategically beneficial in cyber operations.

> 'The central result is that whereas neither international law nor national policy requires self-attribution, under certain strategic conditions it may be preferred.' (McDade, 2014, p. v)

## 1.2 Key Findings

### Attribution in cyberspace poses significant challenges.

> 'Clark and Landau claim that cyber espionage, in the manner that states like the U.S. and Russia execute it, is virtually undetectable.' (McDade, 2014, p. 22)

## 1.2 Key Findings

### There is no legal requirement for the U.S. to self-attribute in cyber actions.

> 'After an exhaustive examination of international law, traditional ethics and U.S. national policy, it seems that there is no concrete language dictating that the United States must self-attribute any actions in cyberspace.' (McDade, 2014, p. 24)

## 1.2 Key Findings

### Establishing norms of responsible behavior can involve self-attribution.

> 'Self-attribution to set things right can be a strategy to establish norms of responsible behavior.' (McDade, 2014, p. 56)

## 1.3 Shortcomings Limitations

### The U.S. lacks clear legal guidelines for self-attribution in cyber operations.

> “After an exhaustive examination of international law, traditional ethics and U.S. national policy, it seems that there is no concrete language dictating that the United States must self-attribute any actions in cyberspace.” (McDade, 2014, p. 24)

## 1.3 Shortcomings Limitations

### The evolving nature of cyber warfare complicates strategic decision-making.

> “Cyber warfare is a new and emerging subject, and its rules are evolving. Likewise, the laws and policies governing its conduct are also evolving.” (McDade, 2014, p. 24)

## 1.3 Shortcomings Limitations

### Non-state actors pose challenges in the realm of cyber operations.

> “The potential of cyber-attack to be launched from nearly anywhere by state or non-state actors mandates the need for international response and control, hence the Tallinn Manual and the power granted to the U.N. Security Council.” (McDade, 2014, p. 41)

## 1.4 Research Gap and Future Research Directions

### Current research lacks clarity on the defined question.

> “Through a review of relevant literature, it appears that this question is neither defined nor addressed in current research, popular culture or government discourse.” (McDade, 2014, p. 2)
