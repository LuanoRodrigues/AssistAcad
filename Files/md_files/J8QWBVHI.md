# <h1>Adverse Cyber Operations: Causality, Attribution, Evidence, and Due Diligence</h1>

## Introduction

### Digitalization has interconnected the world while posing significant risks.

> “Digitalization has driven the interconnectedness and interdependence of the world in an unprecedented way, especially through the creation and expansion of cyberspace.1 Unsurprisingly, as with almost any highly innovative technological advances, the manifest and enormous benefits of digital globalization are accompanied by serious risks and unforeseen challenges.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 431)

## Introduction

### Adverse cyber operations against states are increasing and difficult to attribute.

> “One of the key challenges is adverse cyber operations against States, operations that are already on the rise and that will certainly escalate in the near future.2 What appears to make adverse cyber operations so inviting is, for technical reasons, such operations are extremely difficult—if even possible—to attribute to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.3 As long as the causal links between the cyber operation and its adverse effects and the conduct of those responsible cannot be established precisely, attribution of the cyber operation to a particular State is not possible. Without accountability, or the possibility of being held accountable, adverse cyber operations are, and will remain, a very attractive tool for States to harm and destabilize other States.4” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 432)

## Introduction

### Adverse cyber operations raise complex legal questions in international law.

> “Besides causality and attribution problems, adverse cyber operations raise peculiar legal issues in public international law, such as classification. These include jus ad bellum questions, such as whether cyber operations constitute “armed attacks” within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the U.N. Charter and “use of force” within the meaning of Article 2(4). They also include jus in bello questions, such as whether cyber operations may give rise to an “armed conflict” triggering the applicability of international humanitarian law5 or constitute an “attack” within the meaning of Article 49(1) of Additional Protocol I.6 These issues have been dealt with comprehensively, most notably by the international group of experts that prepared Tallinn Manual 2.0.7 Accordingly, this article will not take up these threshold issues.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 432)

## Introduction

### The article focuses on causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues in cyber operations.

> “Rather, this article will focus on those causality and attribution problems briefly outlined above. These problems form the focal points of the debate concerning responses to adverse cyber operations. Both causality and attribution lead to evidentiary questions, such as which party bears the burden of proof and what the applicable standard of proof is when a party alleges a breach of an international obligation. This article will address these questions and related evidentiary questions. We argue that, with regard to adverse cyber operations, causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also, and decisively, informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin, that is, the State from whose territory the adverse cyber operation originates.8 Accordingly, in Part III, we address due diligence requirements for States when cyberspace activities occur within their territory.9” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 433)

## Adverse Cyber Operations and Possible Responses

### Adverse cyber operations are defined as actions causing harm through cyberspace.

> “Before delving into an analysis of these legal issues, the term “adverse cyber operation” requires definition. The term “cyber operations” and closely related terms have been defined in the Tallinn Manual as well as other academic works.10 According to the Manual, a cyber operation is “the employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving objectives in or by the use of cyberspace.”11 Cyber operations include “cyber attacks” and “cyber exploitations.” Cyber attacks are those operations “reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.”12 In contrast, cyber exploitations are operations where the sole focus is to “obtain information without affecting the functionality of the accessed system.”13 Finally, the term “cyber incident” frequently is used synonymously with cyber operations.14” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 434)

## Adverse Cyber Operations and Possible Responses

### An adverse cyber operation is specifically aimed at inflicting harm using cyber capabilities.

> “In this article, we use the definition of cyber operation assigned by the Tallinn Manual.15 Accordingly, an adverse cyber operation is the employment of cyber capabilities with the purpose of causing harm in or by the use of cyberspace.16” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 434)

## Adverse Cyber Operations and Possible Responses

### Legal responses to adverse cyber operations involve issues of causality, attribution, and evidence linked to self-defense or countermeasures.

> “Causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues resulting from adverse cyber operations are invariably linked to the legal basis for the potential responses by States affected by the operation (the victim-State). These responses could flow from the right to self-defense under Article 51(1) of the U.N. Charter17 or, arguably, the right to adopt countermeasures.18 Indeed, some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called “active defenses” or “active cyber defenses,”19 which are “in-kind response(s) . . . against the attacker’s system.”20 These measures, also called “hack backs,”21 are directed to stop the attack by disabling its source.22 Finally, the victim-State may put forward a “plea of necessity”23 to justify an otherwise unlawful response to an adverse cyber operation. However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held that a “state of necessity” can be invoked only under very restrictive circumstances.24” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 435)

## II. Causality and Attribution

### Causal links and factual predicates are essential for attribution in cyber operations.

> “Regardless of whether the response is premised on the right of self-defense, the right to adopt countermeasures, or a plea of necessity, the causal links between the cyber operation and its adverse effects, and the person, group of persons, or entity who conducted the cyber operation must be established. In addition, it may be necessary to meet certain factual predicates to attribute the perpetrator’s conduct to a particular State.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 435)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Distinction between Causality and Attribution

### Causality in cyber operations seeks to link actions to specific actors.

> “Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and, even more importantly, to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 436)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Distinction between Causality and Attribution

### Attribution involves legal criteria connecting individuals to state actions.

> “In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is, primarily, a normative issue.25 The legal rules of attribution serve the purpose of limiting the international responsibility of States. A State within the territory of which a person, group of persons, or entity carried out a certain activity can be held internationally responsible only if there is a sufficiently close link between the person, group of persons, or entity and the State. Whether a link is sufficiently close is also a factual issue, but it is also a judgment. For making this judgment, several normative criteria have been developed and, finally, laid down in the 2001 ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States. These criteria define which relationships between a person, group of persons, or entity are sufficiently close to the State to consider their conduct that of the State.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 436)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Distinction between Causality and Attribution

### Certain normative criteria are used to assess the attribution of conduct to States.

> “The relevant normative criteria include instances in which the person, group, or entity is a State organ,26 and where the person, group, or entity has been empowered with governmental authority by the State.27 Moreover, the conduct of a person or group of persons acting on the “instructions” or under the “specific directions”28 or “effective control”29 of the State is an act of the State.30 Whether these normative criteria are met depends, of course, on certain facts, which, if contested, must be proved.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 436)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Distinction between Causality and Attribution

### Attributing private conduct to States requires demonstrating effective control or directives.

> “In particular, efforts to attribute private conduct to States through the effective control test31 face difficult factual challenges since in the cyber context a party must demonstrate that the State exercised effective control over the “operations in the course of which the alleged violations were committed.”32 It may be similarly difficult to demonstrate that a private actor acted on the instructions of a State, a fact, which, if established, would, attribute the conduct to that State.33 Under all three tests—effective control, specific directions, instructions—it has to be proven that “‘effective control’ was exercised, or that the State’s instructions were given, for each operation in which the alleged violations occurred.”34 When applied to a cyber operation, the conduct complained of (e.g., launching the malware) must have been an “integral part” of the operation directed or controlled by, or carried out on the instructions of, the State.35 It is not sufficient to show that control was exercised, or directions or instructions were given, “generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violations.”36 Rather, the particular “physical acts constitutive of [the breach of an international obligation]” must have been “carried out wholly or in part, on the instructions or directions of the State, or under its effective control.”37” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 437)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Challenges to Causality and Attribution in Cyberspace

### Causality problems in cyber operations arise from the speed, anonymity, and deceptive practices that hinder identifying the actors involved.

> “Due to the speed, anonymity, and ever-growing deceptive practices of cyber operations, the identification of the actor who launched a cyber operation poses a multitude of causality problems. Today, it is simple to hide one’s tracks and traces of actions in the Internet and, as a further complication, conceal one’s identity.38 Anonymization tools like the TOR-browser39 are available to anyone who can access the Internet and their use has become very common, especially for criminals trading on the Dark Net.40 And while digital forensics continue to improve, traceability remains difficult if the only source of information is solely technical data. Without additional information gathered through intelligence, it remains difficult to know what person, group of persons, or entity initiated the cyber operation. In short, it is still nearly impossible to trace a cyber operation with absolute certainty to a particular computer system and, more importantly, to its author.41” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 438)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Challenges to Causality and Attribution in Cyberspace

### state actors, often using proxies.

> “Similar problems arise with regard to the facts necessary to establish the factual prerequisites of attribution of private conduct to a State under all three tests.42 As Banks notes, “state and non-state cyber threats now often blend and merge, as privateers operate as surrogates for states and provide cover for state-based actors.”43 In particular, States may use proxies, defined here as “non-state actors with comparatively loose ties to governments,”44 to commit malicious cyber operations without acting under the effective control, specific direction, or instructions of the government.45 For example, news media often report Russian hackers conduct cyber operations, but then stop short of claiming that the group acted under direct orders of the Russian government.46” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 439)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Burden of Proof

### The State must prove the existence of facts to support its legal claims.

> “The production of evidence establishing causality and attribution is the responsibility of the State that bears the burden of proof. When addressing a contested fact, the burden falls on the State that would benefit from the fact were it to be proved. Whether a particular fact is beneficial to a State depends on the legal claim raised by the State. If the claim asserted by the State only survives if a particular contentious fact is true, the burden of proof regarding this fact rests with the State asserting the claim. This placement of the burden aligns with the maxim affirmanti incumbit probatio because a State typically will assert only those facts that support its claim.47 Indeed, the ICJ has held that “[a]s a general rule it is for the party which alleges a fact in support of its claims to prove the existence of that fact.”48  Under this rule, if a State claims to have used force in the exercise of the right of self-defense, it must prove that it suffered an armed attack.49 It must also prove that the attack is attributable to the State against which force was used, that is, the State of origin of the attack.50” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 440)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Burden of Proof

### In cyber operations, the injured State must establish authorship and a causal link to the attack.

> “Thus, in the cyber context, to attribute adverse cyber operations to a State, the injured State must establish the following facts: (1) the identity of the person, group of persons, or entity authoring the operation; and (2) that the author or authors’ conduct is attributable to that State.51 The burden of proof is discharged only if the victim-State can demonstrate a causal link between the cyber operation, its adverse effects, and its author or authors.52 In addition, if the author is a private individual or non-State actor, the injured State must prove that the operation was effectively controlled by, or carried out under the specific directions or instructions of the State against which it acted.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 440)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Burden of Proof

### Burden of proof may vary if the response is a countermeasure against the origin State.

> “The burden of proof may be different, however, in instances where the response is a countermeasure against the State of origin of the adverse cyber operation. Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, the injured State may have to prove only that the State of origin breached its duty to prevent significant transboundary harm by not taking reasonable measures to prevent imminent, or stop ongoing, adverse cyber operations carried out from within its territory.53” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 440)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Burden of Proof

### Evidence of another State's responsibility must meet the applicable standard of proof.

> “Assuming the victim-State has produced evidence on another State’s responsibility for a cyber operation, the question then arises whether the evidence is sufficient to discharge the burden of proof. This question has to be decided in light of the applicable standard of proof.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 440)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof

### The standard of proof is defined as the quantum of evidence necessary to substantiate factual claims.

> “Green defines the standard of proof as “the quantum of evidence necessary to substantiate the factual claims by the parties.”54 Meeting this standard requires a party to persuade a court or trier of fact that its claims are true.55 Of course, truth cannot be established objectively. Rather, the standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.56 Whether the required degree of probability and, therefore, the standard of proof is met depends on a deliberative assessment by the trier of fact based on the evidence submitted.57” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 441)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:1. Standard of Proof on the National Level

### National standards of proof vary, with 'beyond a reasonable doubt' being the highest and civil law jurisdictions applying a single general rule.

> “On the national level, the standards of “clear and convincing” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” are well-established concepts, with “beyond a reasonable doubt” being the highest standard of proof.58 The lowest standard is “prima facie evidence,” which requires merely indicative or plausible proof.59 An intermediate standard is “preponderance of probability,” under which the existence of the fact to be proved must be more likely than not, or, in other words, that it is reasonably probable.60 Whereas common law jurisdictions apply all three standards of proof depending on the situation, civil law jurisdictions tend to limit the standard of proof to a single general rule: the judge must be “convinced” or “fully convinced” that a disputed fact is true.61” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 441)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:1. Standard of Proof on the National Level

### The 'convinced or fully convinced' standard requires high probability, but judges can lower this standard under certain circumstances.

> “The degree of probability required to satisfy the convinced or fully convinced standard may be further defined as a “probability excluding reasonable doubt” or “probability close to certainty.”62 However, there are exceptions where the judge may lower the standard of proof by procedural rules or substantive provisions of the applicable law.63” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 442)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:2. Standard of Proof on the International Level

### International courts vary in their standards of proof.

> “International criminal courts strictly adhere to the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard.64 Other international courts, tribunals, and dispute settlement bodies fluctuate between different standards of proof, often without providing precise definitions of each standard or their scope of application.65” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 442)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:2. Standard of Proof on the International Level

### The ICJ prioritizes judicial latitude in evaluating evidence.

> “Since our analysis is restricted to the exercise of the right of self-defense and the use of countermeasures—fundamental aspects of public international law—the most authoritative source among international judicial bodies with regard to standards of proof is the ICJ.66 That Court seems to insist on as much judicial latitude as possible. As a former judge and president of the ICJ states, “The Court’s prime objective as to standard of proof appears to have been to retain a freedom in evaluating the evidence, relying on the facts and circumstances of each case.”67 Indeed, the ICJ has not articulated even a general standard of proof to be applied in cases brought before it.68 One plausible explanation for this lack of an articulated standard is that a truly international bench of judges, such as the ICJ, includes lawyers from various legal traditions, including both common law and civil law jurisdictions.69 This inclusivity, in turn, may contribute to a reluctance to make express reference to national concepts of standard of proof, each of which has its own legal history, doctrinal structure, and normative context. In fact, the ICJ restricts itself to drawing “inspiration from both the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and continental systems of civil law.”70” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 443)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:2. Standard of Proof on the International Level

### The standard of proof depends on the gravity of the international obligation breached.

> “hich the international responsibility of a party is at stake the standard of proof depends on the nature of the international obligation allegedly breached by that party.71 If the obligation breached is of “exceptional gravity,” such as a claim alleging a violation of the prohibition of genocide, the standard of proof is that the “evidence . . . is fully conclusive” and the Court has to be “fully convinced that [the] allegations . . . have been clearly established.”72 Moreover, the Court stated, “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.”73 Some scholars have suggested that the Court is satisfied with a lower standard of proof74 when the claim is that a State “has breached its undertakings to prevent genocide and to punish and extradite persons charged with genocide”75 in requiring “proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation.”76 This argument is not persuasive.77 Still, “appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation” supports the view that the standard of proof applied by the ICJ varies with the seriousness of the alleged breach of international law.78” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 444)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:2. Standard of Proof on the International Level

### A sliding scale of proof standards is proposed based on the severity of breaches.

> “Our doctrinal suggestion, therefore, is twofold. First, the pertinent standard of proof is derived from a sliding scale.79 The highest standard, requiring “fully conclusive evidence,” would apply to breaches of exceptional gravity. Continuing down the scale, the next standard, “conclusive” or “convincing evidence,” would apply when the charges are of severe gravity. A “preponderance of the evidence” would apply in instances of medium gravity. Finally, “prima facie evidence” would apply in cases of minor gravity.80 Second, the standard of proof applied as a function of the seriousness of the alleged breach of international law would also apply with regard to attribution, and, thus, also to the causality of the conduct allegedly amounting to a breach of international law” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 445)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof:2. Standard of Proof on the International Level

### The sliding scale applies to claims of lawful deviation from international law.

> “This sliding scale of standards of proof would also apply to a State’s claim that it was lawfully permitted to deviate from a norm of public international law.81 In the context of adverse cyber operations, possible responses include claims to take countermeasures or to exercise the right of self-defense.82 Countermeasures are legally permissible responses to most breaches of international obligations83 and may deviate from almost any international obligation.84 Measures of self-defense are legally permissible responses to an armed attack, and may deviate from the prohibition of the use of force.85 The application of the sliding scale of standards of proof proposed above depends on the gravity, or seriousness, of the deviation from public international law. As a result, the standard of proof is typically high in cases of self-defense and lower in cases of countermeasures. This means that the victim-State acting in self-defense through use of force (thus deviating from the prohibition of use of force) has to meet, as a rule, a higher standard of proof as regards its claim that it is, or has been, the victim of an armed attack by another State. Whereas the victim-State taking countermeasures below the threshold of use of force (thus deviating from norms other than the prohibition of use of force) has to meet a lower standard of proof as regards its claim that another State has breached an international obligation owed to the victim-State.86” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 446)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof for Claims of Self-Defense:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### defense require the highest standard of proof when severe use of force is involved.

> “Under the above analysis, determination of the standard of proof concerning claims of acting, or having acted, in self-defense as an exception to the general prohibition on the use of force87 must take into account that the prohibition is widely accepted as a jus cogens rule.88 Hence, a deviation from the prohibition of the use of force would be a case of exceptional gravity warranting the highest standard of proof (fully convinced).89 Accordingly, a victim-State engaging in self-defense must have fully conclusive evidence establishing that an armed attack has occurred and that the attack is attributable to the attacking State. However, with regard to the prohibition of the use of force, one must “distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms.”90 Therefore, the highest standard of proof should apply only to claims of self-defense if the measures taken in self-defense amount to the most grave forms of the use of force. In case of measures taken by the victim-State against the attackerState that are less grave forms of the use of force, conclusive or convincing evidence would be the appropriate standard of proof. Certainly, a State that is the victim of an armed attack, which responds with measures well below the threshold of the most grave forms of the use of force, should not be expected to meet the highest standard of proof in defending the lawfulness of its action.91” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 447)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof for Claims of Self-Defense:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### defense cases, differing from national standards.

> “Admittedly, the ICJ seems to apply an intermediate standard of proof in self-defense cases without distinction as to the gravity of the amount of force used by the victim-State.92 While expressly rejecting a “balance of evidence” test,93 in Oil Platforms, the Court found the evidence presented by the United States “inconclusive” regarding Iran’s responsibility for the naval mine struck by a U.S. warship or the missile attack on a U.S.-reflagged merchant vessel.94 In that same judgment, the Court indicated conclusive evidence constituted evidence that was more than merely “suggestive” or “highly suggestive.”95 This finding is consistent with earlier statements of the Court indicating convincing evidence is the standard of proof to be applied in jus ad bellum cases involving actions taken by military forces.96 Thus, as noted earlier,97 one should hesitate to equate this international standard of proof (convincing evidence) with the national standard of clear and convincing evidence found in common law jurisdictions.98” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 447)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof for Claims of Self-Defense:2. Standard of Proof for Cyber Operations

### Victim-States must provide convincing evidence of cyber attacks for self-defense claims.

> “Hence, based on the aforementioned ICJ jurisprudence, if the victim-State of an adverse cyber operation responds with the use of force against the State of origin, it must collect, and if necessary present sufficient evidence to meet the Court’s convincing evidence standard of proof.99 Thus, the evidence must convincingly establish the victim-State was, or continues to be, the object of an adverse cyber operation amounting to an armed attack that is attributable to the State of origin.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 448)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Standard of Proof for Claims of Self-Defense:2. Standard of Proof for Cyber Operations

### The standard of proof for claims of self-defense remains unchanged despite complexities in cyber operations.

> “Of course, in some instances, it may be impossible for a State injured by an adverse cyber operation to discharge its burden of proof concerning causality and attribution.100 Nevertheless, the technical and intelligence gathering complexities inherent in establishing causality and attribution in these cases do not warrant a lowering of the standard of proof generally applicable in jus ad bellum cases. Indeed, there is no persuasive argument for applying different standards of proof based on the manner in which the injury was inflicted. In all cases, a deviation from the prohibition of the use of force based on a claim of lawful self-defense must be assessed under the same standard of proof.101 As an example, in Oil Platforms, the ICJ required the United States—the victim-State of an armed attack—to present conclusive evidence of Iranian culpability despite the challenges for doing so.102 This same standard should apply for States responding to adverse cyber operations.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 448)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### Non-armed cyber operations limit the right to self-defense.

> “If the adverse cyber operation is not an armed attack within the meaning of Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, then there is no right to engage in self-defense. In such instances, the taking of non-forcible countermeasures,103 as defined by Article 22 of the Draft Articles, may be the appropriate response.104 However, countermeasures are not available to the injured State if the cyber operation cannot be attributed to the State of origin. In that situation, the victim-State is restricted to protests to that State for its failure to comply with its duty to prevent significant transboundary harm.105” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 449)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### Injured States must provide proof for countermeasures.

> “An injured State must prove each fact necessary to establish that the legal requirements for taking countermeasure are met.106 In the Gabčikovo-Nagymaros judgment, the ICJ required a State taking countermeasures to present evidence demonstrating that the offending State “is responsible for an internationally wrongful act.”107 This condition implies that the internationally wrongful act must have already occurred,108 and that it is attributable to the other State under one of the circumstances set forth in Articles 4 through 10 of the Draft Articles.109 Accordingly, as in the case of self-defense, the State taking countermeasures must prove the facts substantiating causality, as well as the factual basis for attributing the wrongful act to the State against which the countermeasures are directed.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 450)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### The standard of proof for countermeasures varies with the obligation's gravity.

> “As discussed above, the pertinent standard of proof depends on the gravity of the breach of the international obligation that the injured State owes to the other State.110 Countermeasures are “measures that would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of an injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State, if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”111 Accordingly, it is not the gravity of the previously committed breach of the international obligation by the responsible State that determines the standard of proof the injured State must meet to justify its countermeasure.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 450)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:1. Generally Applicable Standard of Proof

### Countermeasures can breach various international obligations based on their nature.

> “The gravity of the injured State’s departure from the international obligations it owes to the responsible State depends on the nature of the international obligations and the extent of their impairment through the taking of a countermeasure. All international obligations of the injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State may be breached by a countermeasure except those, which are listed in Article 50 of the Draft Articles.112 Among these sacrosanct international obligations are the prohibition on the threat or use of force and obligations under norms of jus cogens.113 Therefore, the international obligations from which the injured State intends to derogate by the taking of countermeasures will be those of less fundamental importance. Hence, the standard of proof concerning factual allegations by the injured State in support of its claim to have taken countermeasures is not typically the highest standard of proof of fully conclusive evidence, but conclusive or convincing evidence, or a preponderance of evidence. The choice between these two standards of proof depends not only on the nature of the obligation impaired by the countermeasure, but also on the magnitude of the violation of the international obligation.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 450)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:2. Standard of Proof for Cyber Operations

### Active defenses are debated but generally justifiable countermeasures against cyber operations.

> “The most effective countermeasures to adverse cyber operations, and the most intensely debated, are “active defenses,” also known as “hack-backs.”114 Examples include “programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine.”115 An in-depth discussion of the legality of active defenses is beyond the scope of this article. Here, it is assumed that, while their use must be analyzed in each individual case, active defenses are in general justifiable countermeasures.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 451)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:2. Standard of Proof for Cyber Operations

### The standard of proof for active defenses varies based on international obligations and may require conclusive evidence.

> “Like with all countermeasures, the standard of proof when active defense measures are taken depends on the nature of the international obligation impaired. And, as with other countermeasures, active defenses may not violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force. If a countermeasure in the form of an active defense were an act of the use of force, it would trigger the standard of proof to be applied generally in jus ad bellum cases, that is, conclusive evidence.116 In this regard, Judge Simma, in his separate opinion in Oil Platforms,117 observed that forcible “proportionate defensive measures” in response to hostile acts could be justified as falling “short of” an Article 51 “(full-scale) self-defence.”118 Some legal experts applied this reasoning to adverse cyber operations that do not amount to an armed attack arguing that forcible cyber countermeasures that do not cross the threshold of the most grave forms of the use of force are lawful.119 But even applying Judge Simma’s “lower-level, smaller-scale proportionate defensive measures”120 criteria in response to adverse cyber operations might be considered a use of force, albeit a less grave form of use of force. And as a use of force, the standard of proof to justify an active defense would certainly have to be that of conclusive evidence.121” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 452)

## II. Causality and Attribution:Standard of Proof for Cyber Countermeasures:2. Standard of Proof for Cyber Operations

### The classification of active defenses in relation to the use of force depends on their circumstance and intent.

> “Whether active defenses are below the use of force threshold is ultimately a question of degree depending on the circumstances of the individual case and particularly the factual consequences arising from their use.122 If, due to their small scale and limited effects, they do not constitute a use of force, they may nevertheless contravene the principle of non-intervention. This does not mean that active defenses that are not a use of force are always an intervention. A wrongful intervention is defined by the “element of coercion,” which “forms the very essence of [a] prohibited intervention.”123 The only legitimate objective of active defenses is to induce the State of origin to cease adverse cyber operations and return to compliance with the law.124 Thus, active defenses typically have an element of coercion since they are in effect law enforcement measures.125 More importantly, active defenses may damage the information technology (IT) systems at which they are directed. Accordingly, we suggest that the applicable standard of proof should generally be conclusive evidence.126 The standard should be lowered to a preponderance of the evidence if the victim-State’s countermeasures have only a minor effect on IT systems and are designed to warn the State of origin of more severe actions to follow if the adverse cyber operations continue.127” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 453)

### The standard of proof for attribution in international law often relies on convincing evidence, including indirect evidence.

> “In many, if not most cases, the standard of proof will be convincing evidence, a rather high standard of proof. This standard does not rule out the consideration of indirect evidence.128 Accordingly, depending on its reliability, value, and weight, indirect evidence may be sufficient to meet the convincing evidence standard.129 In Corfu Channel, the ICJ correctly held that “indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions.”130 The Court further explained that indirect evidence “must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.”131 Indirect evidence is of the utmost importance if the conduct that breached an international obligation took place in territory under the exclusive control of the State being held accountable due to the difficulty of collecting evidence. The Court explicitly acknowledged that, “[b]y reason of this exclusive control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility.”132” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 454)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### Victim States can trace cyber operations to State IT systems using digital forensics.

> “The factual situation in the Corfu Channel case is analogous to the situation in many cases involving adverse cyber operations. Here, the victim-State may be able to use digital forensics and “inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence”133 to trace the cyber operation to a State IT system located within a State-owned or State-controlled facility134 of the State of origin.135 The missing causal link is the conduct of the person, group of persons, or entity that launched the cyber operation.136 Without knowledge of the specific conduct and the individuals or entity involved, it is impossible to apply the rules of attribution as reflected in Articles 4 to 10 of the Draft Articles.137” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 454)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### A cyber operation launched from a State facility confirms State organ responsibility.

> “Nevertheless, when the operation has definitely been launched from a State IT system located within a State-owned or State-controlled facility, the victim-State has conclusively established that the adverse cyber operation was the responsibility of a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the Draft Articles. This conclusion is reasonably inferred from the facts that have been proven: only public officials, hence, persons having the status of a State organ or belonging to an entity having said status,138 working in, or having access to the State facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.139 In these circumstances, the injured State has discharged its burden of proof in establishing that it was authorized to respond with actions in self-defense and countermeasures.140” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 455)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### Inferences can establish that a cyber operation from a State system involves State organs.

> “Admittedly, one may wonder whether it is possible to establish through mere inference that a cyber operation launched from a State IT system within a State-owned or State-controlled facility was conducted by a State organ. However, one has to take into account that it is, in accordance with the principle of free assessment of evidence, a deliberative judgment as to whether the applicable standard of proof has been met by circumstantial evidence. Such a deliberative judgment must consider the maxim ultra posse nemo obligatur (No one is obligated beyond what he is able to do). Hence, the victim-State cannot be required to submit direct evidence regarding the identity of the individuals operating the State IT system within the State-owned or State-controlled facility during the cyber operation, or evidence as to whether these individuals acted in the official capacity of State organs. It is practically impossible to produce such direct evidence. It is only possible for the State of origin to disclose which persons operated the relevant IT system when the cyber operation was launched.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 455)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### Burden of proof shifts to the State of origin to disprove State organ involvement.

> “Consequently, the burden of proof is shifted to the State of origin. That State may claim—and prove—that a State organ did not conduct the adverse cyber operation.141 For example, it may submit evidence establishing conclusively that a particular non-State actor (or a State organ of a third State) committed the adverse cyber operation through unlawful use, or hacking, of the State IT system. If the State of origin is unable to establish convincingly that a specific non-State actor introduced the malware into its IT system, it must then prove a so-called “negative fact,” namely the absence of culpable conduct by its own State organs. In that regard, however, the legal principle negativa non sunt probanda or factum negantis nulla probatio, under which a party denying a fact is not bound to offer proof, is no longer a rule of international law.142 Indeed, in Nicaragua the ICJ held that “[t]he evidence or material offered by Nicaragua in connection with the [United States’] allegation of arms supply [by Nicaragua to Salvadorians] has to be assessed bearing in mind the fact that, in responding to that allegation, Nicaragua has to prove a negative.”143 This passage, while not reviving the Roman rule, indicates that the evidentiary burden may be lowered when it comes to establishing a negative fact.144” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 456)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### Due diligence requires the State of origin to prove it took reasonable measures against cyber operations.

> “Due diligence must also be considered. If the State of origin can prove convincingly that it took all reasonable measures to prevent the launching of adverse cyber operations from within State-owned or State-controlled facilities or the hacking of its IT system within those facilities, then it has discharged its burden of proof.145 That is, it convincingly established the negative fact that the actor responsible for the adverse cyber operation was not, and could not have been, a State organ. The true actor had to have been a non-State actor or a third State not acting under the effective control, the specific directions, or the instructions of the State of origin.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 457)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:1. Situation I: Cyber Operation Traceable to a State IT System

### The victim State bears the burden of proof for establishing causation and attribution.

> “Here, the injured State, having established the adverse cyber operation was launched from a State of origin’s IT system located within a State-owned or State-controlled facility, and the State of origin having established that it had to have been authored by a non-State actor or third State, the issue becomes which State bears the burden of proof for a contentious nonproven fact. In this instance—a situation of non liquet—the facts to be proven are conduct (the launching of an adverse cyber operation) by a person, group of persons, or entity having the status of a State organ, or by non-State actors acting under the control, directions, or instructions of the State of origin.146 The burden of proof for establishing these facts falls to the victim-State, which has failed in that regard since the State of origin has provided convincing evidence that, due to a lack of causation and attribution, it cannot be held responsible for the adverse cyber operation. Accordingly, the victim-State cannot respond through self-defense or take countermeasures.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 457)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Cyber operations from private IT systems shift state responsibility interpretation.

> “If the victim-State convincingly establishes that the adverse cyber operation was launched from a private IT system within the territory of the State of origin, the analysis to determine State responsibility becomes much different. The inference that can be made when a State IT system within a State-owned or State-controlled facility is the source of the operation no longer applies. To the contrary, the obvious inference to make is that the adverse cyber operation resulted from private conduct.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 457)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### State must prove private conduct ties in cyber attribution cases.

> “Under these facts, for purposes of attribution to the State of origin, the State injured by an adverse cyber operation must prove the conduct was carried out by a private person, group of persons, or entity under the effective control, specific direction, or the instructions of the State of origin within the meaning of Article 8 of the Draft Articles.147 Alternatively, it would sustain its burden of proof if it could establish that, while a private IT system was utilized, the private IT system was operated by a State organ, as defined by Article 4 of the Draft Articles.148 Again, it may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the victim-State to submit convincing evidence that these factual requirements for attribution are met. On the assumption that the victim-State has convincingly established that the cyber operation was initiated from a private IT system within the State of origin’s territory, it still must prove additional facts to satisfy attribution. Namely, it must prove that certain conduct by specified actors being either State organs or non-State actors operating under the effective control, specific directions, or the instructions of the State of origin lie within the domain, or sphere, of the State of origin. Absent cooperation of that State, these facts are inaccessible to the injured State.149 In such a situation, the victim-State is again limited to the production of indirect evidence, that is, proof of facts from which it can be inferred that the adverse cyber operation was conducted by either a State organ or by a non-State actor acting under the effective control, specific directions, or the instructions of the State of origin.150” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 458)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Shifting burden of proof to the State of origin could enhance attribution efficacy.

> “One alternative would be to shift the burden of proof to the State of origin. Antonopoulos argues that if an injurious cyber activity can be traced to the territory of a single State . . . the best approach in the cyber context is to attribute hostile cyber acts to this State on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which may be rebutted by the State on the basis of evidence.”151” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 459)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Defense claims.

> “However, there are a number of issues to consider in adopting this approach, and under no circumstances, should this approach apply to the exercise of self-defense or the taking of countermeasures. First, the ICJ’s jurisprudence does not support shifting the burden of proof in this manner.152 In Corfu Channel, the ICJ explicitly held that “the mere fact of the control exercised by a State over its territory . . . by itself and apart from other circumstances . . . [does not] shift[] the burden of proof,”153 even in cases not involving the use of force. Second, in case of a claim of self-defense, the burden of proof to present facts supporting the claim falls completely with the victim-State. This rule would also apply to a claim of the right to take countermeasures. Third, the use of force through the exercise of the right of self-defense cannot be premised on mere presumptions concerning causality and attribution. To do so could subject the State of origin to the use of force on little more than prima facie evidence. This is far too low a standard to allow breaches of the prohibition on the use of force. The same applies to the use of active defenses. Fourth, to rebut the presumption, the State of origin would be required to prove negative facts, namely that the private person, group of persons, or entity concerned was not acting under its effective control, specific directions, or its instructions, or that the private IT system was not operated by a State organ when the adverse cyber operation was initiated.154” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 459)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### States must avoid impossible proof requirements in accountability cases.

> “Of course, both the burden of proof and the corresponding standard of proof must not “degenerat[e] into a probatio diabolica (a legal requirement to achieve an impossible proof).”155 Accordingly, a State must not be placed in circumstances where its burden of proof is impossible, or almost impossible, to discharge against the applicable standard of proof. The purpose of procedural rules, as of any law, is to ensure justice.156 Therefore, the interpretation and application of procedural rules (and thus, also evidentiary rules), should not prevent States from being held accountable for serious breaches of their international obligations. This applies in particular to those adverse cyber operations that are armed attacks within the meaning of Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, but also to other adverse cyber operations falling below this threshold.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 460)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### States face challenges when identifying cyber operation actors.

> “One situation that could amount to a probatio diabolica is when an injured State convincingly establishes that the cyber operation can be traced to a private IT system located in the State of origin’s territory, but it is unable to identify the actor whose conduct launched the adverse cyber operation with convincing evidence. Similar difficulties arise for establishing if the actor, when identified, was a State organ157 or a private person, group of persons, or entity acting under the effective control, specific directions, or the instructions of, State of origin authorities.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 460)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### State.

> “To avoid a probatio diabolica, the State of origin is under a duty to cooperate in good faith with the victim-State.158 As long as the State of origin cooperates in good faith, the victim-State will not have recourse to self-defense measures or active defenses. This duty of the State of origin to cooperate is an expression of its “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.”159 Once the injured State has notified the State of origin that it was the victim of an adverse cyber operation emanating from a private IT system within the latter State’s territory, the origin State has knowledge that its territory has been used for an act infringing upon the rights of other States.160 This knowledge activates the State of origin’s duty to prevent the continuation of such acts.161 As the ICJ held in Corfu Channel, this duty includes a duty to cooperate. It is true that a State on whose territory or in whose waters an act contrary to international law has occurred may be called upon to give an explanation. It is also true that that State cannot evade such a request by limiting itself to a reply that it is ignorant of the circumstances of the act and of its authors. The State may, up to a certain point, be bound to supply particulars of the use made by it of the means of information and inquiry at its disposal.162” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 461)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### State must show it sought cooperation from the State of origin.

> “Accordingly, the injured State has to establish convincingly that it sought information from the State of origin “with sufficient specificity” on the operation of the private IT system at the time the adverse cyber operation began, and that the authorities of the State of origin “declined or failed to respond to such specific requests.”163” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 461)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Bad faith cooperation from the State of origin can imply state control over private IT usage.

> “If the State of origin is unwilling to cooperate or cooperates in bad faith, for example, by unduly delaying or subverting cooperation efforts or by proposing obscure conspiracy theories, the victim-State may infer from such behavior that the private IT system was either operated by State organs164 or by private persons, groups of persons, or entities acting under the effective control, specific directions, or the instructions of the State.165 This is not a presumption of causality and attribution, but an inference drawn from the facts, therefore it relies on circumstantial evidence of causality and attribution. Such indirect evidence should, under these circumstances and in view of the rigorous and exhaustive efforts of the victim-State to discharge its burden of proof, be considered sufficient to meet the convincing evidence standard of proof. This conclusion aligns with the ICJ jurisprudence concerning evidence collection in difficult circumstances.166 Accordingly, the victim-State would have to be considered to have discharged its burden of proof as regards causality and attribution of the adverse cyber operation to the State of origin. Hence, the victim-State could invoke its right to self-defense, or take low-level forcible countermeasures if all other prerequisites for a lawful exercise of these rights were met.167” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 462)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Due diligence measures by the State of origin must consider human rights implications.

> “If the State of origin cooperates in good faith, the injured State may not have recourse to either self-defense or cyber countermeasures. The full cooperation shows that the State adheres to its obligations under public international law. Hence, inducement to return to the rule of law through forcible countermeasures is no longer necessary, at least for the period of cooperation. More importantly, the injured State cannot be considered to have discharged its burden of proof if, despite the full cooperation of the State of origin, the attribution of the author of the adverse cyber operation to the State of origin cannot be shown. In this case, the victimState has neither convincingly established that the adverse cyber operation was attributable to the State of origin nor convincingly established that the State of origin violated its “obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States,” as set forth in Corfu Channel.168” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 462)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Resuming cyber operations shifts proof burden to the State of origin regarding due diligence.

> “If, however, the adverse cyber operations resume, and these operations can be traced to the same private IT systems identified previously, the victim-State may infer that the State of origin knew, or should have known, that the private IT system had again been used to initiate adverse cyber operations resulting in transboundary harm. Consequently, the victimState has demonstrated that the State of origin has knowingly allowed its territory to be used contrary to the rights of other States.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 463)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Unidentified private IT systems complicate state responsibility in cyber operations.

> “The resumption of adverse cyber operations shifts the burden of proof to the State of origin, raising the issue of whether the State of origin has acted with due diligence. To demonstrate compliance with its due diligence obligation, it must establish convincingly that it took all reasonable measures to prevent further adverse cyber operations committed by use of the private IT system in question.169 Whether the State of origin’s preventive measures were reasonable depends on the circumstances of the individual case.170 The answer depends not just on the technical and economic feasibility of preventive measures and the State’s capacities,171 but also on human rights considerations.172 Measures aimed at preventing adverse cyber operations may conflict with international human rights, including the freedom of speech and of the press, freedom of access to information, freedom of correspondence and telecommunication, freedom to conduct a business, or protection of personal data.173 Thus, there may be limitations or restrictions on a State’s ability to undertake preventive measures when to do so would infringe upon these rights.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 463)

## II. Causality and Attribution: Proof of Attribution:2. Situation II: Cyber Operation Traceable to a Private IT System

### Unidentified private IT systems complicate state responsibility in cyber operations.

> “If adverse cyber operations are launched from private IT systems that have not been identified as original sources of such operations, it is, in general, impossible to argue that the State of origin knowingly allowed its territory to be used for the commission of acts harmful to another State. Moreover, when a State’s human rights obligations are considered, it cannot be presumed that the State of origin “constantly kept a close watch over”174 all private IT systems within its territory, or had the possibility of so doing.175 Such a presumption assumes the State knew, or should have known, of the abuse, or potential abuse, of all private systems within its territory: an assumption that is unrealistic in the cyber world.176 In this regard, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 has correctly pointed to the “difficulty of mounting comprehensive and effective defences against all possible cyber threats.”177” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 464)

## Conclusion

### Adverse cyber operations aim to cause harm in cyberspace.

> “The foregoing analysis leads to the following conclusions:  Adverse cyber operations are those operations that employ cyber capabilities with the objective of causing harm in, or by the use of, cyberspace.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 464)

## Conclusion

### Victim-States can act in self-defense only against internationally responsible States.

> “In responding to adverse cyber operations, victim-States may have recourse to their right to act in self-defense or to take countermeasures. Both acts in self-defense and countermeasures may be directed, however, only against such States of origin as are internationally responsible for the particular cyber operation. Accordingly, the operation must be attributable to those States.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 464)

## Conclusion

### The victim-State must prove the conduct causing the cyber operation.

> “The victim-State bears the burden of proof for those facts that, if true, establish that the operation was caused (1) by conduct (2) of a person, group of persons, or entity (3) attributable to the State of origin.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### Evidence sufficiency is determined by the gravity of the breach.

> “The question of whether evidence gathered and submitted by the victimState is sufficient to discharge its burden of proof is decided in light of the applicable standard of proof. The standard of proof applies as a function of the gravity of the alleged breach of international law. Accordingly, the standard of proof applicable in the individual case is to be derived from a sliding scale. The standard of proof thus identified also applies with regard to attribution and causality.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### High standards of proof apply for self-defense claims.

> “With regard to acts of self-defense, in general, a high standard of proof, i.e., convincing evidence applies.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### Countermeasures may require high or intermediate proof standards.

> “For the taking of countermeasures, either a high or an intermediate standard of proof, i.e., either convincing evidence or preponderance of the evidence may apply.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### Indirect evidence can meet the burden of proof, even at high standards.

> “Even when convincing evidence is the standard, the burden of proof may be discharged solely based on indirect evidence.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### Tracing cyber operations to a State IT system infers State organ involvement.

> “If the victim-State is able to present evidence tracing the adverse cyber operation to a State IT system, it can be reasonably inferred that a State organ initiated the operation. Once established, the State of origin may then prove the negative fact that a State organ had not authored the operation. It discharges its burden of proof if it is able to prove that it took all reasonable measures to prevent the launching of adverse cyber operations from its IT systems.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### The State of origin must cooperate to help establish proof.

> “If the victim-State is able to establish only that the adverse cyber operation can be traced to a private IT system within the territory of the State of origin, it may be unable to prove the factual prerequisites for attributing the operation to the State of origin. In order to prevent an inability to sustain the burden of proof and the standard of proof from becoming a probatio diabolica, the State of origin is under a duty to cooperate in good faith with the victim-State. This duty is an expression of the general due diligence obligation found within Corfu Channel for States “not to knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.” If the State of origin is unwilling to cooperate or cooperates only mala fide, the victim-State is allowed to infer from such behavior that the operation of the private IT system at the time the adverse cyber operation was launched was attributable to the State of origin.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 465)

## Conclusion

### Notification of cyber operations shifts the burden of proof to the State of origin.

> “Once the State of origin has been notified that a private IT system located within its territory has been the source of adverse cyber operations, for any subsequent operations emanating from the same IT system it may be inferred that the State of origin knew, or should have known, the private IT system was used for cyber operations possibly resulting in transboundary harm. It follows that the burden of proof shifts to the State of origin, which may discharge its burden of proof if it proves that it acted in accordance with its due diligence obligation, i.e., the Corfu Channel rule.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 466)

## Conclusion

### Failure to monitor private IT systems does not imply State negligence.

> “If adverse cyber operations are activated through private IT systems that had never been identified as original sources of adverse cyber operations, it is, in general, impossible to draw the inference that the State of origin failed to comply with its due diligence obligations because it cannot be presumed that the State of origin constantly monitored, or could have monitored, all private IT systems within its territory.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 466)

## Conclusion

### Conclusions provide a balanced approach to evidentiary issues in cyber operations.

> “The aforementioned conclusions form a nuanced and balanced approach concerning evidentiary issues surrounding causality and attribution for adverse cyber operations. The resulting concept accounts for the legitimate interests of both the victim-State and the State of origin without besting either of the two. A victim-State need not fear that its hands are tied, whereas a State of origin need not fear that it will be unduly and prematurely exposed to measures of self-defense or countermeasures.” (Dederer e Singer, 2019, p. 466)
