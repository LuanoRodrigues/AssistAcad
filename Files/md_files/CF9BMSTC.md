# <h1>An international attribution mechanism for hostile cyber operations?</h1>

## Introduction

### Cyberspace is anarchic and lacks normative constraints.

> c“yberspace has long been characterized as anarchic, a domain devoid of normative constraint. Indeed, in remarks to the U.N. General Assembly on his priorities for 2020, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres urged the international community to “usher in order to the Wild West of cyberspace,”1 an echo of President Barack Obama’s 2015 remark at Stanford University that “[t]he cyber world is sort of the Wild West.”2 Obviously, neither leader meant that international law did not reach cyber activities, but they were signaling the uncertainly pervading the precise application of that body of law in the cyber context.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 197)

## Introduction

### Efforts to address the anarchic nature of cyberspace have been made.

> “Scholars and practitioners have been laboring to address that uncertainty. Most significant in this regard have been the two Tallinn Manual projects sponsored by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence.3 However, both manuals avoided claims of certainty where reasonable differences of opinion existed as to the interpretation of a rule of law in the cyber context. Indeed, their major contribution may have been in pointing out where views diverged, thereby allowing States to focus interpretive efforts where they were most needed.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 197)

## Introduction

### The Tallinn Manual projects highlight interpretative divergency in cyber law.

> “Numerous explanations have been proffered for the reluctance of States to invoke international law in relation to hostile cyber operations. One is the assertion that norms developed in a kinetic or offline context are inadequate to address the unique features of cyber operations, which can be perpetrated by proxies, are often designed to spoof the originator, and can cause nonphysical effects that are nevertheless very severe. For instance, the concepts of use of force and armed attack in the jus ad bellum seem ill-suited when applied to cyber operations that dramatically disrupt civilian life without causing physical damage or that target data. In the same vein, international humanitarian law’s rules on targeting cannot easily be interpreted and applied in the cyber context in a manner that reasonably balances military necessity and humanitarian considerations given the integrated nature of many military and civilian infrastructures.6” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 198)
“The political or operational interests of States that find themselves on the virtual frontline, either facing hostile operations or launching them, is another common explanation for their hesitancy to invoke international law.7 They may be reluctant to draw attention to a hostile cyber operation out of embarrassment, because doing so could reveal technical cyber security capabilities and vulnerabilities, or due to concern that it would create unwelcome domestic pressure to respond. States on both sides of the equation might be apprehensive about committing to a specific interpretation of an international law rule, such as on where the threshold for a violation of sovereignty or wrongful use of force lies. And some States certainly believe that a policy of deterrence unfettered by normative strictures offers a more promising way to prevent harmful cyber operations than reliance on international law norms and institutions.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 199)

## Introduction

### States are reluctant to invoke international law for hostile cyber operations.

> “There may be, however, a further explanation for such reluctance—the lack of a credible attribution mechanism capable of validating the facts underlying State legal claims regarding cyber operations. Such information is necessary not only to understand what actually happened, and to identify the culprit, but also to mobilize third-party support for the victim State’s assertions, including through collective attribution of (and response to) the operation. More to the point, as a matter of law, “internationally wrongful acts” (violations of international law) require both breach of a State’s international law obligation and attribution of the act (which may consist of either an action or an omission) to a “responsible” State.8” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 199)

## Introduction

### Different factors prevent states from utilizing international law in cyber contexts.

> “The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility are generally accepted as restating the customary international law standards for attribution to States. In the cyber context, the two most likely, albeit not only, bases for attribution are that an organ of a State, such as the armed forces, launched the cyber operation that breached the obligation in question,9 or that a non-State actor, like a hacktivist group or a private company, did so upon the instructions or under the effective control of a State.10 There are different standards of proof depending on the purpose of the assertion of unlawfulness,11 but legal rights under international law can only be effectively invoked and relied upon in practice on the basis of an adequate factual foundation.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)

## Introduction

### Lack of credible attribution mechanisms hampers international law enforcement.

> “The linkage between the need for factual information about those behind hostile cyber operations and giving effect to the rules of international law has been the driving force behind initiatives by the Atlantic Council,12 Microsoft,13 RAND,14 and academics in support of an international attribution mechanism.15 The goal of these initiatives is to promote accountability for past operations that violate international law and raise deterrence against future ones. A potentially important step towards realizing this vision was the 2019 establishment of the CyberPeace Institute, which is co-sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, Mastercard, and Microsoft.16 Among its goals, the institute intends to perform, facilitate, and coordinate “collective analysis, research, and investigations of sophisticated cyberattacks” in order to “close the accountability gap.”17 Yet, to date, no concrete effort is underway to establish a full-fledged international mechanism charged with engaging in technical attribution of hostile cyber operations, and in linking such operations to States.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 200)

## Introduction

### Attribution is necessary for establishing state responsibility in cyber incidents.

> “It is against this backdrop that we organized an international research project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem to consider the feasibility of establishing an international attribution mechanism, as well as the usefulness of such a body.18 By international attribution mechanism, we mean an entity that is multinational and diverse in its makeup, whether composed of private individuals or public officials, with responsibility for identifying the State or non-State actors who have either conducted a hostile cyber operation or are otherwise involved in that operation.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)

## Introduction

### Current efforts to establish an international attribution mechanism are lacking.

> “Workshops organized by the project brought together academics and policymakers, including experts with relevant legal, political, and technological backgrounds, to discuss papers prepared by the project’s researchers on such topics as standards of proof for attributing cyber operations under the law of State responsibility, the use of private cybersecurity companies to investigate cyber incidents, investigative models drawn from other technologyintensive fields like weapons control regimes, and the collective attribution practices of the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This process enabled us to identify certain contexts in which an international attribution mechanism could prove useful and a number of constituencies that might be interested in turning to it in appropriate cases.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)

## Introduction

### Existing workshops are exploring the feasibility of such attribution mechanisms.

> “The discussions, which were subject to the Chatham House Rule, have led us to conclude that, for the time being, States wielding significant cyber capability have little interest in creating an international attribution mechanism for cyber incidents. Such States appear to be of the view that they can generate sufficient accountability and deterrence based on their independent technological capacity, access to expertise and to offensive (active defense) cyber tools, political clout, security alliances, and other policy tools, such as sanctions.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)

## Introduction

### Significant cyber capabilities discourage states from supporting an attribution mechanism.

> “At the same time, our discussions suggested that countries with limited technological capacity and less ability to mobilize international support for collective attribution are more amenable to the prospect, especially as a tool for “naming and shaming” States conducting unlawful cyber operations against private and public infrastructure in their territory. Furthermore, we are of the view that international or regional organizations that have the ability to facilitate collective sanctions in relation to unlawful cyber operations directed against member States or their partners, like the EU with its sanctions regime,19 might appreciate in certain situations an official finding of legal responsibility for a number of political and legal reasons.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 201)

## Introduction

### Countries with limited tech capacity support the idea of an attribution mechanism.

> “This article examines several possible justifications for establishing an international attribution mechanism and its principal constituencies. Part II sets forth the general case for international fact-finding mechanisms in international law, particularly when there is a need to rely on scientific and technological expertise. Part III details the shortcomings of the existing processes for attributing responsibility for hostile cyber operations. Part IV reviews proposals to establish an international attribution mechanism, while Part V examines the constituency for a new mechanism. Our concluding thoughts are set forth in Part VI.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 202)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### International fact-finding mechanisms historically link to peace and security.

> “The linkage between international peace and security and international factfinding has a long pedigree in international law. In the aftermath of the February 1898 sinking of USS Maine in Havana harbor and the ensuing SpanishAmerican War,20 a Permanent Court of Arbitration was created pursuant to the 1899 Hague (I) Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, a body that continues to operate today.21 The agreement also provided for international commissions of inquiry “to facilitate a solution of [‘differences of opinion’] by elucidating the facts by means of an impartial and conscientious investigation.”22 Fyodor Martens, the prominent Russian diplomat who introduced the commissions of inquiry provisions during the 1899 Peace Conference, described them as establishing a voluntary fact-finding mechanism that could avoid inflammatory disinformation about the causes of an international dispute while gaining time to resolve the matter.23” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 202)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Russian proposal to investigate responsibility in commissions of inquiry faced limited support.

> “Interestingly, the Russian delegation to the 1899 Conference proposed adding the investigation of questions of responsibility to the duties of the commissions of inquiry, although Martens himself expressed limited enthusiasm for the proposal, noting that it could trespass into the realm of arbitration. He conceded, however, that States were free to conclude special agreements to that effect.24 Indeed, in 1904, a commission of inquiry established to investigate a maritime incident in the North Sea was authorized to establish responsibility for the incident and to allocate the degree of blame of those involved.25” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 203)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Fact-finding mechanisms in human rights law are crucial for accountability.

> “In recent decades, fact-finding and inquiry mechanisms often have been employed in the field of international human rights law to establish accountability for violations and to facilitate subsequent action by political bodies entrusted with promoting respect for human rights. The frequent utilization of ad hoc bodies, such as commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions,26 more permanent bodies with renewable mandates, such as thematic and country rapporteurs and working groups,27 and international treaty bodies invested with the power to conduct inquiries,28 reflects the international human rights system’s post-1967 shift from standard-setting to implementation activities.29” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 203)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Fact-finding mechanisms enhance political action in civil aviation and labor law.

> “Fact-finding mechanisms have also been used to support action by political bodies in other fields of international law, such as international civil aviation law30 and international labor law.31 By contrast, international humanitarian law fact-finding mechanisms, most notably the fact-finding commission provided for in the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions,32 have not been operationalized because of limited interest in resorting to them by States involved in armed conflicts.33” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 204)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Fact-finding enhances legal and political accountability in various contexts.

> “In many cases where fact-finding mechanisms have been established and utilized, the resort to independent experts links, directly or indirectly, to the goal of advancing legal and political accountability.34 By elucidating facts through a process of investigation that is legitimate and credible, States that violate international law are less able to avoid legal responsibility by denying the underlying facts or their involvement in the situation. Furthermore, publicizing facts with self-evident legal or moral implications can “shame” State and non-State actors, as well as alert them and other actors to the possibility of being held accountable should they continue to engage in unlawful conduct.35 Determining the facts can also provide a degree of satisfaction for victims.36 And of course, establishing the factual record can enable followup action to assign legal or political responsibility and the taking of appropriate measures against those responsible.37 In other words, fact-finding fosters accountability by exposing facts and facilitating accountability-generating processes, thereby also enhancing deterrence. In doing so, fact-finding mechanisms contribute to the rule of law in international relations.38” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 205)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Fact-finding mechanisms are effective in arms control and relevant to cyber operations.

> “A specific area of international relations in which fact-finding mechanisms have proven effective is arms control. Fact-finding in this field, especially with respect to the development, use, and proliferation of unconventional weapons, is especially relevant to cyber activity because States tend to operate behind a shroud of national security secrecy and investigations require sophisticated scientific expertise to collect and analyze data. Examples include the technical verification mechanisms developed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (through an Additional Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement),39 the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) (through the inspection activity of the Technical Secretariat),40 and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) (through the verification and monitoring activities of the Technical Secretariat).41” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 206)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Verification mechanisms collect and analyze data for compliance monitoring.

> “Verification mechanisms typically have ongoing monitoring responsibilities, such as routine inspections,42 and the collection of data from monitoring stations43 and on-site instruments.44 They can also respond to specific concerns about compliance, as with “challenge inspections” under the Chemical Weapons Convention,45 investigation of alleged use of chemical weapons pursuant to the U.N. Secretary-General Mechanism,46 inspections upon request by a State party to clarify whether another State has conducted a nuclear test in violation of the CTBT,47 and special inspections undertaken by the IAEA.48 In such cases, information collected and analyzed by verification mechanisms can include, for instance, documents, technical data, samples, and interviews.49” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 207)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Verification mechanisms deter violations and support accountability in arms control.

> “In that verification mechanisms have the potential to embarrass violators50 and set international legal and political processes of condemnation and sanction in motion,51 they are integral to the stability of arms control regimes. Such mechanisms not only deter would-be violators by enhancing the likelihood of detection,52 but also provide a means for States to refute unfounded allegations.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 207)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### UK utilized OPCW inspections for accountability after the Salisbury incident.

> “The recent resort by the United Kingdom to the OPCW inspection machinery in connection with the Salisbury incident illustrates how a technical fact-finding apparatus can be used to shame a violating State and support accountability. It also casts new light on some of the principled arguments discussed below, which question the necessity of developing an international accountability mechanism in the field of cyber security.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 207)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### UK leveraged OPCW findings to enhance credibility against Russia.

> “On March 4, 2018, two Russian nationals were poisoned in Salisbury through exposure to a rare nerve agent. Eight days later, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May announced in the House of Commons that the poison was a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia known as “Novichok.”53 The United Kingdom then took retaliatory measures against Russia, including the expulsion of twenty-three Russian diplomats.54 The United Kingdom also looked to the OPCW for help in investigating the incident, a decision welcomed by the EU.55 Following a technical assistance visit, the organization released a public summary of its findings on April 12.56 The full confidential report, which reportedly corroborated the U.K. law enforcement findings concerning the nerve agent, was circulated to OPCW member States.57 On July 13, the United Kingdom asked again for OPCW assistance in investigating a poisoning incident, this time in Amesbury; the resulting report matched the Amesbury toxic chemicals with those found in Salisbury.58” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 208)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### A similar accountability framework could be applied to cyber operations.

> “A central issue for the purposes of this article is the United Kingdom’s motivation in seeking OPCW assistance. That the OPCW merely confirmed the United Kingdom’s findings demonstrates that the organization was not filling a capability gap. Indeed, on March 27, even before completion of the OPCW investigation, twenty of the United Kingdom’s Western partners moved to expel Russian diplomats (more than one hundred in total) based on those findings.59 Rather, it appears the United Kingdom leveraged the organization to enhance the credibility of its findings regarding the poison, thereby enabling it and other States to name, blame, and shame Russia more effectively.60” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 209)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### A similar accountability framework could be applied to cyber operations and state denials.

> “Similarly, in a speech at the OPCW on June 26, 2018, U.K. Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed the need to further enhance accountability by authorizing the Technical Secretariat to attribute responsibility for chemical attacks in the context of Syria. Our aim . . . is to reinforce the OPCW as an institution. Last November, the Security Council was prevented from renewing the Joint Investigative Mechanism, meaning that no international body is working to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. At present, the OPCW’s experts will say where and when an attack happened, but not who was responsible. If we are serious about upholding the ban on chemical weapons, that gap must be filled. Attributing responsibility for an attack is clearly part of the OPCW’s technical remit, requiring no change to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Director General has confirmed that the OPCW is able and willing to perform this essential task.61” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 209)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### The EU Council supported the development of a sanctions regime for chemical weapons.

> “In a decision adopted by the Conference of State Parties the next day, authorization was granted. Reaffirming that “those responsible for the use of chemical weapons should be held accountable,” the Conference decided that:the Director-General, if requested by a State Party investigating a possible chemical weapons use on its territory, can provide technical expertise to identify those who were perpetrators, organizers, sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons, and further decide[d] that, in this context, the Director-General may enlist support as appropriate from outside experts with relevant qualifications and professional experience, and invites the Director-General to submit to the Conference at its next regular session specific proposals to establish such independent, impartial, expert arrangements.62” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 210)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### A similar accountability framework could be applied to cyber operations and state denials.

> “The day after the Conference acted, the EU Council expressed support for the implementation of the decision and for the development of a chemical weapons sanctions regime.63 Such a regime subsequently was characterized by the United Kingdom as an effective means of holding individuals and entities responsible for the proliferation and use of chemical weapons.64 Further Council support for “international initiatives aimed at tackling the threat of chemical weapons” came in October with the implementation of a sanctions regime.65” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 210)

## The Role of Fact-Finding Mechanisms in International Law

### Finding.

> “To summarize, flagrant violations of international law norms prohibiting the employment of chemical weapons initiated an effort to impose accountability through the use of an international fact-finding mechanism and by authorizing it to attribute legal responsibility. These moves were accompanied by ad hoc sanctions against suspected perpetrators and the development of a standing sanctions mechanism. The question is whether a similar dynamic involving international fact-finding, attribution of international responsibility, and the imposition of collective sanctions would be viable in other fields of activity involving national security that pose technical attribution challenges and face denials by responsible States, specifically cyber operations.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 211)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### States are increasingly willing to collectively attribute hostile cyber operations.

> “States that have fallen victim to hostile cyber operations are increasingly willing to attribute them to other States.66 Moreover, attribution is often collective in the sense that it involves the issuance of a common statement or endorsement of another State’s assertion of responsibility. The collective attributions of the WannaCry67 and NotPetya68 cyber operations, as well as hostile cyber operations targeting the OPCW69 and Georgia,70 are illustrative of this developing practice.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 211)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox aims to create a joint response to cyber aggression.

> “There has also been some progress in developing a structure for collective attribution. Of particular note, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox,71 which was adopted in 2017, provides for a joint EU diplomatic response to hostile cyber operations. It is premised on the belief that “clearly signaling the likely consequences of a joint EU diplomatic response to . . . malicious cyber activities influences the behavior of potential aggressors in cyberspace thus reinforcing the security of the EU and its Member States.”72 As part of the broader EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, the EU established a cyber-related sanctions regime in 2019 that provides for the imposition of “targeted restrictive measures” on natural and legal persons.73 Both the Toolbox and the sanctions regime clarify, however, that a joint diplomatic response or the imposition of sanctions should be distinguished from a decision to attribute responsibility to a foreign State, which is described as “a sovereign political decision taken on a case-by-case basis,”74 one to be “based on all-source intelligence and . . . in accordance with [the] international law of State responsibility.”75” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 212)“There has also been some progress in developing a structure for collective attribution. Of particular note, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox,71 which was adopted in 2017, provides for a joint EU diplomatic response to hostile cyber operations.

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### International efforts to create coalitions for cyber deterrence are underway.

> “Other States and international and regional organizations are also crafting collective responses to hostile cyber operations. In 2018, the United States announced an International Cyber Deterrence Initiative aimed at building a coalition of like-minded States that can act “in concert” to impose “consequences” on adversaries, so as to ensure that they “understand the consequences of their malicious cyber behavior.”76 The 2018 U.S. National Cyber Strategy also envisions intelligence sharing with key partners to identify hostile State and non-State cyber activities.77 The same year, NATO leaders adopted the Brussels Summit Declaration, which confirmed that NATO’s collective defense policies applied to cyberspace and called on its members to consider responding to malicious cyber activity in a coordinated manner.78” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 213)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### Attribution often lacks transparency and supporting evidence, undermining credibility.

> “It should be noted that attribution is seldom accompanied in practice by the release of the underlying evidence, despite broad international support for the principle that States should, where possible, provide the basis for that attribution. For instance, the 2015 U.N. Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which included all permanent members of the Security Council and whose consensus report was endorsed by the General Assembly, noted that “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.”79 Still, the responsibility to release the evidence underlying attribution was styled as a voluntary, non-binding norm of responsible State behavior, not as a legal obligation.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 213)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### Key states deny a legal obligation to disclose evidence when attributing cyber actions.

> “Indeed, key States, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have taken the position that there is no legal duty to accompany public acts of attribution with disclosure of any underlying evidence.80 Although there are various reasons for the reluctance to commit to releasing evidence, the most commonly cited is that such a practice can risk revealing intelligence sources and methods and cyber capabilities. Yet, absent supporting evidence, the credibility of public attribution is open to challenge. Likewise, collective attribution is less likely when intelligence on an incident is not shared.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 214)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### Evidentiary challenges hinder the effectiveness of regional sanctions against cyber aggressors.

> “Evidentiary issues might also hamper regional mechanisms for cyberrelated sanctions. For example, the EU cyber-related sanctions regime is based on a list of natural or legal persons responsible for hostile cyber operations. Inclusion on the list by the Council requires the proposal of a member State or the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Although those targeted by restrictive measures may submit observations leading to reevaluation, the sanctions regime neither specifies the requisite evidentiary threshold for inclusion, nor mandates the sharing of the underlying intelligence with other member States.81” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 214)

## The Present State of Cyber Attribution

### Doubts remain regarding the effectiveness of collective attribution statements in improving cybersecurity norms.

> “It is worth noting that some commentators have expressed doubt as to the effectiveness of recent collective attribution statements, noting the limited number of States involved, a frequent lack of transparency surrounding the process of attribution, the failure to identify specific international law obligations that the operations breached, and the lack of political will in following up with the imposition of sanctions and other responses against the responsible State.82 Arguably, these shortcomings hinder the development of substantive law in the field of cyber security, since they provide few indications of those cyber operations that States consider unlawful—information that is essential in both the interpretation of existing legal rules in the cyber context and the crystallization of new rules of customary international law.83” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 214)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### Calls for an international attribution mechanism are fueled by transparency issues in current practices.

> “Against this backdrop, there have been numerous calls for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism that would foster public confidence in the attribution claims of national security agencies and private cyber security companies. Although such public and private bodies have considerable professional expertise, their work tends to lack transparency,84 and their governmental affiliation or commercial interests sometimes render their claims suspect.85” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### An independent international mechanism could enhance credibility and facilitate collective attribution.

> “An independent international mechanism could lend credibility to attribution in the cyber realm, thereby limiting the ability of responsible States to deny involvement and facilitating collective attribution and response. Like the OPCW Technical Secretariat, such a mechanism could prove useful for State and non-State actors in certain situations.86 To be sure, such a mechanism should complement, not replace, existing attribution mechanisms and practices. Optimally, it should find ways to harness the evidence gathering and analytical wherewithal of State agencies, and the technical expertise resident in the public and private cyber security sectors.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### The Atlantic Council proposed the establishment of the MCAAC to improve state responsibility for cyber incidents.

> “Several initiatives aimed at promoting an international attribution mechanism have been launched in recent years. In 2014, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, proposed the establishment of a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council (MCAAC).87 The MCAAC would serve as an inter-State body entrusted with investigating cyber incidents with a view to attributing responsibility to States when appropriate. It could then issue recommendations for de-escalation or refer the matter to other political or adjudicative bodies. The Atlantic Council’s proposal envisioned the gradual development of such a mechanism as ad hoc coalitions of States undertook joint investigations of hostile cyber operations, sometimes in collaboration with private actors.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 215)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### private organization for technical investigations of cyber incidents.

> “In 2016, Microsoft published a proposal for an attribution premised on the investigation of incidents by international experts comprising a publicprivate organization.88 The organization would conduct a technical investigation of certain operations that fell within its purview and report its findings, including evidence of attribution. Only in certain cases would the findings be published publicly. The proposal envisioned the mechanism as also offering a form of peer review of attribution claims made by other public or private entities.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 216)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### RAND Corporation's Stateless mechanism relies on private cyber experts for incident investigation.

> “The following year, the RAND Corporation proposed a Stateless attribution mechanism consisting of a consortium of private experts specializing in cyber technology and policy that would, on a discretionary basis, investigate and attribute incidents, as well as provide analysis concerning the severity of the incident and the sophistication of the operation. While the consortium would not be involved in follow-up action, other stakeholders might use its findings for that purpose.89” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 216)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### The CyberPeace Institute was established to foster accountability and research in cyberspace.

> “Eventually, in 2019, Microsoft joined forces with Mastercard and the Hewlett Foundation to establish the CyberPeace Institute.90 The Institute’s mandate includes promoting accountability in cyberspace by facilitating collaborative research into the behavior of those launching hostile cyber operations and ways to fend off such operations, and through publishing information on the techniques, practices, and effects of attack tools. In other words, it is less an attribution mechanism than an entity producing information that can help other entities effectively attribute.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 216)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### Other initiatives, aside from the CyberPeace Institute, have struggled to gain momentum.

> “With the exception of the CyberPeace Institute, which has been established, neither these nor other initiatives91 have gained much momentum. Based on discussions during the Federmann Cyber Security Research Center’s workshops with legal, policy, and technical experts, diplomats and other State officials, academics, and industry executives, several tentative reasons for this lack of progress can be identified.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 216)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### Major state actors show little interest in developing an international attribution mechanism.

> “To begin with, and perhaps most significantly, some major State actors in the field of cyber security appear uninterested in developing an international attribution mechanism, largely out of a sense that the mechanism would be redundant. After all, powerful and technologically savvy States have developed processes for technical attribution that rely upon their own technical forensic capacity, as well as their intelligence assets, especially signals intelligence and human intelligence. When required, they collaborate with their partners, some of whom also field impressive capabilities to perform attribution; occasionally, they even turn to private cyber security companies to provide specialized expertise. Once such States can attribute, they have the offensive tools and the political and economic clout to respond meaningfully to hostile cyber operations, either alone or in collaboration with other States.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 217)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### help measures over international legal accountability.

> “Moreover, some States appear skeptical about the very push for legal accountability. Arguably, the proposed mechanism would help to clarify the law applicable to cyber operations, thereby limiting the operational flexibility that results from legal ambiguity. In the view of skeptical States, legal clarity constrains the cyber operations of “rule of law” States, but proves ineffective in limiting operations by adversaries that do not share that commitment to the rule of law. Viewing international law as asymmetrically disadvantageous, these States would prefer to rely on self-help, like robust cyber defenses, offensive tools, and credible warnings, rather than international law, to safeguard their cyberspace.92 They fear that referral of incidents to an international attribution mechanism might over time deprive them of the discretion ambiguity offers in terms of attribution and response options.93” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 217)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### Participants noted shortcomings in proposed initiatives impacting their acceptance.

> “Some workshop participants also suggested the initiatives have a number of shortcomings that have impeded acceptance. For instance, they opined that the Atlantic Council proposal is short on detail and that a few of its features—especially vis-à-vis attribution follow-up—could be regarded as overly ambitious. Its inter-State aspects also pose a risk of politicization.94 The Microsoft proposal is likewise lacking in detail. Further, in that it proffered a hybrid institution, States may have been apprehensive about sharing the allocation of State responsibility with non-State actors. The fact that the proposal was put forward by a powerful global commercial entity also generated some skepticism, fair or not, as to Microsoft’s motives. The RAND proposal is more detailed but envisages a Stateless mechanism over whose configuration, mandate, and modus operandi States would have limited influence. This arrangement is unlikely to appeal to States, especially when comparable investigative services are available from private companies.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 218)

## Proposals for International Attribution Mechanisms

### More targeted proposals could strengthen the case for an international attribution mechanism.

> “Finally, numerous participants were of the view that the case for an international attribution mechanism would have been strengthened had the initiatives more directly identified the specific constituencies likely to be effectively served and the contexts in which the proposals would prove most useful. In other words, the proposals could be characterized as overbroad in the sense that they called for a major restructuring of cyber attribution and the underlying concept of accountability. Thus, some participants argued that a more sophisticated approach would have been to associate the proposed mechanism with specific needs—a need to increase global capacity to make credible attribution claims, a need to encourage collective attributions, and a need to support multilateral follow-up efforts.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 218)

## The Way Forward

### The legitimacy of international law in addressing hostile cyber operations relies on the accuracy of the attribution process.

> “Effective application of international law to any domain of international relations hinges on the interaction between legal norms, fact-finding processes that identify violations and attribute responsibility to a State or non-State actor, and follow-up measures, which can include shaming, making claims in diplomatic or adjudicative fora, and imposing sanctions, including countermeasures.95 The legitimacy of each link in the chain is premised on the legitimacy of the preceding links; thus, the legitimacy of accusations and responses depends on the legitimacy of the underlying legal rules and attribution process.96 Specifically, the legitimacy of the attribution process undergirds the ability of an accuser to convince relevant target audiences, including third States that might join collective attribution statements or support multilateral sanctions.97” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 218)

## The Way Forward

### finding mechanisms are critical for establishing legal compliance and enhancing the legitimacy of international responses.

> “As explained above, fact-finding provides a basis for legal and political claims. Thus, fact-finding mechanisms are especially useful in fields where legal compliance is chronically deficient, such as human rights law, where there is a special need to further legitimize norm-implementation efforts and increase deterrence, or where unique technical challenges present themselves, as in the case of unconventional weapons. Indeed, the use of the OPCW’s technical facilities in connection with the Salisbury incident illustrates the benefits of fact-finding in cases requiring complex scientific analysis, as well as the growing interest of States in internationalizing attribution processes.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 219)

## The Way Forward

### Establishing an international attribution mechanism can assist technologically vulnerable states in achieving accountability.

> 'Moving forward, we maintain that the goal of creating an international attribution mechanism remains viable and that such an entity would prove valuable, albeit primarily in three contexts. First, an international attribution mechanism could prove useful for States with a limited independent capacity to effectively generate accountability. This includes States that, on the one hand, are sufficiently advanced technologically so as to render them highly vulnerable to hostile cyber operations, but, on the other hand, lack the technological capability to conduct their own forensic investigations and access to high-quality intelligence that can support attribution to a State actor. In this context, an international attribution mechanism could help level the playing field.' (Shany & Schmitt, 2020)

## The Way Forward

### States technologically vulnerable to cyber operations often lack the resources for independent forensic investigations.

> “Moving forward, we maintain that the goal of creating an international attribution mechanism remains viable and that such an entity would prove valuable, albeit primarily in three contexts. First, an international attribution mechanism could prove useful for States with a limited independent capacity to effectively generate accountability. This includes States that, on the one hand, are sufficiently advanced technologically so as to render them highly vulnerable to hostile cyber operations, but, on the other hand, lack the technological capability to conduct their own forensic investigations98 and access to high-quality intelligence that can support attribution to a State actor.99 In this context, an international attribution mechanism could help level the playing field.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 219)

## The Way Forward

### size states depend on collective support for effective responses to cyber operations due to limited capabilities.

> “Furthermore, small and mid-size States often lack the diplomatic, economic, technical, or military means to effectively respond, when appropriate, to hostile cyber operations,100 thereby making them dependent on their ability to mobilize other States to support them. Yet, relying on other States or private cybersecurity companies for attribution assistance risks having the information provided dismissed as politically biased or profit driven. As a result, it might not generate the level of legitimacy needed to mobilize third States.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 219)

## The Way Forward

### A properly designed international attribution mechanism would enhance perceptions of independence and reliability.

> “An international attribution mechanism could prove especially useful in this regard. A properly crafted mechanism would be more likely to be perceived as independent, impartial, and professionally reliable. Its factual conclusions would presumably enjoy significant traction, which would enhance the victim State’s ability to generate assistance in imposing accountability.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 220)

## The Way Forward

### Creating an international attribution mechanism would promote collective responses and enhance the legitimacy of attributions.

> “Second, the creation of an international attribution mechanism would signal the growing interest of States in collective attribution, as broad condemnation and multilateral responses are more likely to promote accountability than the reactions of a single State. Collective attribution is most effective when there is a high level of confidence in the initial attribution determination. Such confidence can derive from close relations among relevant States, such as ongoing cooperation between their intelligence agencies, or through legitimacy-enhancing measures, like transparency.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 220)

## The Way Forward

### abiding states to support victims of cyber operations.

> “But in our estimation, an international attribution mechanism would be especially likely to foster collective attribution because of the legitimacy it would presumably enjoy.101 In particular, a credible attribution process would empower States supportive of the rule of law in international relations to take a principled stand beside the victim State.102 The same logic that led to the integration of fact-finding mechanisms in the realm of human rights law to publicly name and shame human rights violators and, in certain cases, to mobilize third States to sanction them applies mutatis mutandis here.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 220)

## The Way Forward

### related sanction regimes by enhancing trust in individual attribution.

> “Third, an international attribution mechanism could play an important role in connection with the operation of cyber-related sanction regimes, such as that of the EU. Such regimes rely upon trust in individual attribution determinations by member States. However, since they involve sanctions on natural or legal actors that may be associated with foreign States, the smooth operation of the regime generally requires a higher level of confidence than might otherwise be the case with collective attribution.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 220)

## The Way Forward

### An independent verification mechanism could improve the reliability of attribution claims for sanction implementations.

> “An independent professional mechanism could offer verification of individual attribution claims, assuaging the concerns of States about the reliability of the attribution determinations upon which they are being asked to take action. Moreover, since cyber-related sanction regimes like the EU’s have implications under the domestic law of the member States, such as the freezing of assets and travel restrictions, domestic courts may examine the evidence underlying the sanction decision or seek credible assurance that the fact-finding process was independent, fair, and provided those involved an opportunity to contest the findings against them.103 An international attribution mechanism could, should it offer features along these lines, help satisfy this demand.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 221)

## The Way Forward

### The configuration of an effective international attribution mechanism must address the needs of various states and stakeholders.

> “In sum, the configuration of the international attribution mechanism must be responsive to the goal of supporting States facing capacity issues, those interested in collective attribution, and cyber-related sanctions regimes. We believe additional research is called for in order to enumerate and ascertain specific “client” preferences and expectations. Key institutional design choices would emanate from such mapping of needs. These include (1) whether the optimal composition is public, private, or hybrid in nature; (2) the triggers to initiation of the mechanism’s investigation; (3) the extent to which a mechanism should be tasked with responsibility beyond technical attribution, such as attribution under the law of State responsibility; (4) the necessary arrangements for access to forensic evidence and intelligence materials, including confidential sharing of information; (5) the opportunity of entities to whom attribution is made to contest evidence collected against them; and (6) whether, and if so when, attribution decisions and supporting evidence should be made public.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 221)

## Concluding Thoughts

### finding mechanisms play a crucial role in establishing accountability and legal responsibility in international law.

> “International fact-finding is a venerable institution. It offers a credible process for ascertaining facts underlying international incidents, and, sometimes, the attribution of legal responsibility for violation of international law norms. Fact-finding mechanisms have been utilized extensively in certain fields of international law, particularly human rights and weapons control, to generate accountability and deterrence. In such fields, it can play an integral role in implementing the rule of law and developing and interpreting relevant international law norms.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 221)

## Concluding Thoughts

### An independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations could enhance legitimacy and stability in international relations.

> “We believe there is merit in the prospect of an independent international attribution mechanism for cyber operations, one along the lines of, but not necessarily identical to, the OPCW’s Technical Secretariat. Cyber operations represent a field of activity plagued by normative ambiguity and limited accountability, where reliance on the victim State’s attribution capacities, or those of other States or private cybersecurity companies, may not measure up to the challenges. An independent attribution mechanism could lead to attribution determinations enjoying a higher degree of legitimacy, thereby serving as a stabilizing force in international relations.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)

## Concluding Thoughts

### Progress towards an international attribution mechanism is possible by engaging States with limited capabilities and relevant international organizations.

> “To date, proposals to establish an international attribution mechanism have not acquired momentum, either because they contain features that States find unattractive or because they were not developed to a degree that made States comfortable. However, we believe progress remains possible by focusing on the three logical constituencies for such a body—States with limited technological, intelligence, and diplomatic capacity; States interested in generating broad collective attribution of attacks perpetrated against them; and international and regional organizations operating a cyber-related sanctions regime. Such a focus, combined with greater granularity, would significantly improve the prospects for the establishment of an international attribution mechanism and its eventual utilization by the international community.” (Shany e Schmitt, 2020, p. 222)
