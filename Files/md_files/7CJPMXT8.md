# <h1>The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Cyber Attribution: A Legal Perspective - Managing U.S.-China Tensions Over Public Cyber Attribution</h1>

## Three Lenses to Interrogate Public Attribution

### Cyber attribution involves technical, political, and legal considerations.

> “After a state—either its government or the private businesses therein—suffers a malicious cyber operation by a foreign actor, it is tempting to identify and publicly blame whoever it believes is responsible for the attack. Such cyber attribution efforts entail three generally recognized considerations, which stem from technical, political, and legal perspectives, respectively.” (Yang, 2022, p. 1)

## Three Lenses to Interrogate Public Attribution

### Technical understanding is crucial for establishing a factual basis for cyber attribution.

> “First, the attributing state must technically understand what happened and describe the truth as much as it can. The creation of a factual foundation for attribution is, in large part, a forensic process through signals intelligence to trace the malicious cyber activities back to a machine or a location. Yet pinning down the human actors who physically conducted the operation behind the screen often requires intense corroboration from human intelligence as well; it goes without saying that the ultimate establishment of responsibility falls within the purview of law. States’ capabilities in this regard are far from evenly distributed,12 which will inevitably lead to an asymmetric pattern of attribution practices. Empirical data shows that technically capable states tend to use public attribution more frequently, with their envisaged adversaries fixed on the receiving ends.13” (Yang, 2022, p. 1)

## Three Lenses to Interrogate Public Attribution

### making significantly influences how states publicly attribute cyber attacks.

> “Second, after the state has attained a certain level of confidence that it knows the source of a malicious cyber operation, it then has a series of political decisions to make—such as whether, when, and in what form to publicly hold the actor accountable, or whether to call for coordinated action from allies. This political decisionmaking is, of course, “a highly complex process which requires trade-offs of multiple considerations.”14 The accusing state may take into account a complex matrix of political pursuits, including: to show accountability to a domestic constituency; to name and shame the accused; to signal for the purpose of effective deterrence; to serve as a window to observe possible reactions from the accused state; to hold a state legally responsible and to justify possible measures in response; or to signify a redline that the accusing state wants to draw in service of its efforts to establish norms. Simply put, a state’s decision as to the timing, the seriousness, and the form of an attribution represents the final trade-off after a comprehensive evaluation over domestic pressure and interstate relations. In this sense, attribution is ultimately political.” (Yang, 2022, p. 2)

## Three Lenses to Interrogate Public Attribution

### Legal attribution connects offenses to offenders according to domestic or international law.

> “Third, from a legal perspective, attribution means imputation by connecting the offense to an offender according to applicable rules, either domestic or international. For the purposes of this chapter, domestic imputation—such as indictment or sanctions against foreign individuals—is left undiscussed; specific focus is put on the intention to establish state responsibility as per applicable international law. Under this premise, legal attribution can legitimize future responding measures, such as self-defense or other countermeasures the accusing state may take, depending on the nature and severity of the original malicious cyber operations. Ideally, the international legal system should provide clear guidance for attribution. However, as will be discussed, the current body of international law is seriously inadequate on this issue.” (Yang, 2022, p. 2)

## Three Lenses to Interrogate Public Attribution

### States can publicly accuse others of cyber operations without a clear legal basis.

> “It’s worthy noting that states may still publicly accuse others of conducting unwanted cyber operations regardless of any clear legal basis for doing so. For example, the United States officially holds that political attribution in the form of official announcements does not require meeting any legal standards in the strict sense.15 This reflects the complexity embedded within public attribution practice as to its diversified form and purpose. Since this chapter specifically focuses on the intention to hold an accused state responsible under international law, the appropriateness of examining an attribution according to technical, political, and international legal criteria should be clear.” (Yang, 2022, p. 2)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Public attribution is particularly susceptible to ill-substantiation due to political pressures.

> “Compared to attribution that is confidentially processed and privately communicated, it’s only logical that public attribution should be better supported. To the very contrary, however, public attribution is particularly susceptible to the problem of ill-substantiation—if not the absence of substantiation at all. The fundamental cause is that—to use the language of the three lenses analytical framework—the political desire to publicly blame an adversary state cannot be properly checked and balanced due to technical imparities and the lack of legal restraints. Under strong political impetus to publicly blame its adversary, the technically capable state seems to enjoy taking advantage of the lawless status quo.” (Yang, 2022, p. 2)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Ill-substantiated public attribution lacks legal logic and sufficient evidence.

> “The term “ill-substantiated public attribution” refers to a subcategory of reckless public denouncements that assign responsibility for a malicious cyber operation to a state without a solid legal logic of imputation or any adequate accompanying evidence. It’s a problem with a moving scale, rather than a simple yes-orno judgment. Around this concept, two illustrating points are necessary.” (Yang, 2022, p. 2)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### The seriousness of public attribution must match its level of substantiation.

> “First, the appropriate level of substantiation should match the purpose and form of public attribution.16 Think of an extreme case, for example, in which a state is held publicly responsible for carrying out cyber operations that amount to an armed attack,17 activating the victim state’s right to self-defense. Obviously, such a claim is subject to challenge unless it can be unequivocally supported.18 A comparable situation is when there is a breach of general international legal obligation, say, of nonintervention, and the accusing state aims to establish responsibility that can justify its future countermeasures. The requirement to support this latter claim should be accordingly downsized.” (Yang, 2022, p. 3)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Ill-substantiated attribution can lead to normative disputes between states.

> “Second, ill-substantiated public attribution has also instigated normative contentions among states. Since 2015, China, Russia, and other countries have consistently held the position that accusations must be substantiated.19 The United States and the UK, among others, are firm advocates of the position that international law does not require disclosure of evidence to support accusations; states can, thereby, “act reasonably under the circumstances.”20” (Yang, 2022, p. 3)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Ill-substantiated attribution undermines political goals and disrupts cyberspace order.

> “This chapter does not contend that public attribution per se is necessarily a problem; rather, it argues that ill-substantiated public attribution is both unhelpful in securing the political pursuits of the accusing state and potentially detrimental to an orderly cyberspace. To list a few issues: 1. Ill-substantiated public attribution is ineffective for the purpose of deterrence because it’s a cheap—and thus less convincing—form of signaling that is insufficient to legitimize possible responding measures. 2. Naming and shaming is unlikely to work as anticipated by the accusing state because reckless finger-pointing may be interpreted as slandering and defamation. 3. Public attribution is treated as a policy tool to ease domestic pressure to react against a foreign malicious cyber operation. But an ill-substantiated—and thus unhealthy—public attribution may breed populism, which will in turn squeeze the policy space. 4. The current asymmetrical pattern of ill-substantiated public attribution is structurally destabilizing because a constantly accusing state may make it normal to point fingers without enough substantiation, while a constantly accused state will grow increasingly resentful and eventually erupt. 5. Ill-substantiated public attribution contributes little—if not being outright detrimental—to norm-building, as it relies on the vacuum of applicable rules.” (Yang, 2022, p. 3)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Legal deficiencies in international law facilitate ill-substantiated public attribution.

> “State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.21 Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution. The deficiencies are threefold: 1. International rules for attribution are inadequate to cope with cyber scenarios. 2. International legal evidence requirements are underdeveloped in general and insufficient for cyber in particular. 3. Legal consequences for making factually incorrect or wrongful public attributions are not clearly defined.” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

### Existing attribution rules struggle to address cyber activities due to inadequate standards.

> “State responsibility arises when there is a breach of international obligation that can be attributed to the state per international law.21 Apart from another long-recognized problem regarding the lack of primary rules on cyber obligations, ill-substantiated public attribution is enabled and encouraged by the legal deficiencies in the current body of international law that relates to attribution.

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### The effective control test may allow states to evade accountability for cyberattacks.

> “The International Law Commission’s (ILC’s) draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA),22 especially articles 4 through 11, represent a fine codification of customary international law on attribution rules. Linking state organs’ activity to that state, per ARSIWA stipulations, proves to be less troublesome; it’s a different story when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors. Unfortunately, most of the situations that concern cyber attribution are in the latter camp. To address the issue of linking a nonstate actor’s behavior to a state, existing proposals de lege lata are quite controversial. Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Due diligence is proposed as an alternative for holding states accountable for cyber actions.

> “The International Law Commission’s (ILC’s) draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA),22 especially articles 4 through 11, represent a fine codification of customary international law on attribution rules. Linking state organs’ activity to that state, per ARSIWA stipulations, proves to be less troublesome; it’s a different story when it comes to evaluating state responsibility for activities conducted by nonstate actors.

Two, respectively regarding control test and due diligence, will be examined below.” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Due diligence obligations complicate attribution in cyber contexts.

> “Regarding the legal standard of the level of control required for attribution to occur, the generally recognized approaches are:23 the “effective control” test devised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Nicaragua v. USA,24 and the “overall control” test developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Tadic decision.25 Some argue that the overall control test should prevail in scenarios of cyber attribution because the effective control test is far stricter and thus may function as “a free pass to state sponsorship of cyberattacks.”26” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Due diligence should define state obligations rather than justify attribution.

> “This proposal is not a suitable solution for two reasons.27 First, both the test standards focus on the level of control a state exerts over the non-state actor—thus, they cannot cover cases of attribution when the malicious cyber activities suggests no obvious evidence of control. Second, the overall control standard was explicitly confined to “organized and hierarchically structured groups” such as military or paramilitary units;28 as a matter of juridical fact, the stricter effective control test has been upheld in determining attribution concerning the acts of individuals or nonorganized groups.” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Accusatory measures must accurately reflect a state's fault in cyber incidents.

> “Considering how difficult it is to persuasively demonstrate that a state is effectively or generally controlling a nonstate entity, an alternative would be to hold states responsible for regulating or preventing malicious cyber operations within their jurisdictions. This is captured by the tendency to incorporate into the international legal principle of due diligence—first recognized by the ICJ in United Kingdom v. Albania, also known as the Corfu Channel case29—into cyber scenarios. But should we treat cyber due diligence as a primary rule of international obligation over state conduct or as a secondary rule to determine violation? There are competing viewpoints.” (Yang, 2022, p. 4)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Accusatory measures must reflect the actual fault of the accused state in cyber incidents.

> “The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare defines “due diligence” as a substantive obligation;30 the United Nations Group of Government Experts (UN GGE) report endorses this approach with similar wording.31 Per this understanding, the original task of attributing malicious cyber operations to a territorial state no longer requires an answer. A new task of legal estimation emerges: whether there is a breach of due diligence obligation. To satisfy this test, it must be proven that the original cyber operation stems from within the territorial state; that it causes serious, adverse consequences about which the territorial state has actual or constructive knowledge; and that the territorial state can but fails to take all feasible measures. Moreover, the original cyber operation must constitute a breach of international obligation should it be conducted by the territorial state.32” (Yang, 2022, p. 5)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Due diligence should set state obligations, not serve as attribution justification.

> “Turning to the minority approach of due diligence as an attribution rule, the identification of the actual author shifts to the state territory where the malicious cyber operation originated. According to such “indirect” or “imputed” attribution,33 a state is deemed to be responsible for the cyber operation harming another state rather than for a breach of its due diligence obligation. This unorthodox approach seems a bit excessive. It’s no wonder the UN GGE report specifically emphasizes that “the indication that an ICT [information and communications technology] activity was launched or otherwise originates from a State’s territory or from its ICT infrastructure may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State.”34” (Yang, 2022, p. 5)

## The Problem With Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution

### Misusing due diligence to support public attribution claims can lead to ill-substantiation.

> “In light of these contending viewpoints, misusing and abusing due diligence to forge a legal argument to back up public attribution claims could facilitate ill-substantiation. It’s thus important to reiterate the following points. First, due diligence, if imported to the cyber scenario, should be better understood as setting an obligation for a state rather than serving as a way to attribute. Second, the actual occurrence of a harmful cyber incident, which would have been unlawful if conducted by a potentially responsible state, is a prerequisite for the injured state to claim a due diligence violation. Third, even if state responsibility is successfully established along the legal path of due diligence, the responding measures that the accusing state might legitimately take should proportionately reflect the fact that the accused state did not conduct the malicious activities but, less harmfully, failed to address them with all feasible measures.” (Yang, 2022, p. 5)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### International law's ambiguity on evidentiary issues facilitates reckless cyber attributions.

> “General international law has not developed a set of clear rules or consistent guidelines on evidence. Key evidentiary issues such as burden and standard of proof are normally dealt with on an ad hoc basis. For cyber disputes, such ambiguity can be interpreted as a loophole that allows states to carry out malicious cyber activities without consequence; or it can be interpreted as an opportunity that allows states to sometimes make attributions recklessly.” (Yang, 2022, p. 5)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### The burden of proof typically rests on the claimant state in cyber attribution cases.

> “Of those two evidentiary issues, burden of proof is less controversial. It is generally recognized that in “a bilateral dispute over State responsibility, the onus of establishing responsibility lies in principle on the claimant State.”35 Yet, somehow, a shift of the burden of proof has been mentioned as a mechanism specifically tailored for cyber attribution, sometimes referred to as a “virtual control” test.36 The main argument behind this idea is that in cyber disputes, the origin state for the alleged misbehavior has better access to the knowledge necessary to establish certain facts. This would probably cause more trouble than it intends to solve,37 as the prima facie responsibility of the accused state would be established with a shift of the burden of proof.” (Yang, 2022, p. 6)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### There are varying standards of proof in international litigation for cyber disputes.

> “Regarding the standard of proof, a comparative assessment of international litigation can identify at least four different levels. In ascending order, these are: 1. The prima facie possibility, which requires only indicative evidence of the claim. 2. A preponderance of evidence, which concerns mainly the balance of probabilities of the two sides. 3. The “clear and convincing” standard, which requires the party to prove the factual claims are substantially more likely true. 4. Proof beyond reasonable doubt, which requires a full chain of evidence weighing together heavily toward one direction that is virtually indisputable.38” (Yang, 2022, p. 6)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### The adequate standard of evidence for cyber public attribution aligns with the 'clear and convincing' level.

> “With some room for debate, ICJ cases and state practices support the “clear and convincing” standard for self-defense cases.39 For disputes with lower-level severity, a generally accepted principle—although without any specifics—is that evidentiary standards should vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense. Extant cases that adopt the “preponderance standard” are mostly regarding territory disputes, which rarely involve state responsibility.40 From these premises, two deductions can be safely made. First, the adequate level of evidence for cyber public attribution should lie around the “clear and convincing” standard. Second, in any event, sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking can be a proper guideline.41” (Yang, 2022, p. 6)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### Setting an evidentiary standard for cyber attribution enhances the credibility of attributions.

> “Some may disfavor setting an evidentiary standard. They may argue that the assessment of the adequacy of evidence is only meaningful in a legal forum, but most cyber public attribution cases won’t ever go through litigation. This seemingly realistic viewpoint neglects the fact that clarity about the amount and quality of evidence has its merits. According to Kristen Eichensehr, “Even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions.”42” (Yang, 2022, p. 6)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Evidentiary Requirements

### Timeliness in making attributions must not compromise the requirement for sufficient evidence.

> “Another opposing viewpoint is that it is hard to reconcile the evidentiary requirement on cyber attribution on one hand with the necessity to make a timely attribution on the other.43 This dilemma indeed exists. It should be subject to careful evaluation in specific contexts. But challenges in collecting and exhibiting evidence should not excuse evidence-less accusations.” (Yang, 2022, p. 6)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Erroneous Attribution

### The lack of legal consequences for erroneous cyber attributions fosters irresponsible claims.

> “If a state makes a cyber attribution with facts that turn out to be erroneous—or, even more seriously, if it carries out self-defense or countermeasures against an accused state based on ill-substantiated allegations—what legal consequences should the accusing state face? Underdevelopment of this legal issue provides extra room for ill-substantiated public attribution because no foreseeable punishment exists for irresponsible or erroneous allegations.” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Erroneous Attribution

### Erroneous cyber attributions can make the accusing state internationally liable for unjustified actions.

> “To begin with, it’s safe to infer that once the attribution proves to be based on false facts, the international wrongfulness of the subsequent self-defense or countermeasure adopted by the accusing state cannot be unquestionably eliminated. In other words, the accusing state may be held responsible for taking unjustified steps.” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Erroneous Attribution

### Claims of good faith do not absolve a state from responsibility for wrongful attributions.

> “If the accusing state argues that it has used its best judgment and built its case for attribution on all then-available evidence in good faith, could claims of “reasonableness” and “honesty” exonerate its false judgment? Positive view is echoed by some scholarly papers,44 as well as official statements.45 For example, the Tallinn Manual explicitly asserts that “the exercise of the right of self-defense . . . is subject to the existence of a reasonable determination that an armed attack is about to occur or has occurred, as well as to the identity of the attacker. This determination is made ex ante, not ex post facto. Their reasonableness will be assessed based upon the information available at the time they were made, not in light of information that subsequently becomes available.”46” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Erroneous Attribution

### Wrongful cyber attributions result in liability regardless of the good faith of the acting state.

> “Opposite views opine that with good faith or not, wrongful attribution in the first place will nonetheless make subsequent measures the fruit of a poisonous tree. The ILC holds that if, during an ex post examination, the attribution turns out to be wrongful because of errors in ex ante factual assessment, the mistaken state may be subject to responsibility whether its agents acted in good faith or not.47” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Legal Deficiencies That Encourage Ill-Substantiated Public Attribution:Erroneous Attribution

### Public attributions without consequences can damage reputations and promote irresponsible accusations.

> “Lastly, what if the accusing state makes a public attribution that later proves to be wrong, but it did not take concrete measures originally? Although the accused state does not suffer from the responding measures, harm to its fame and reputation has still been inflicted. Under such circumstances, should the accusing state be held partially responsible for the false attribution (which might have been intentional)? Would not holding it responsible encourage more ill-substantiated public accusations? This issue deserves more international discussion.” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution

### An international norm on responsible public attribution is necessary.

> “Against the challenges posed by ill-substantiated public attribution, tentative solutions should be sought along the three lenses analytical framework, with due considerations paid to the technical, political, and legal dimensions. As this chapter focuses on the legal lens, an international norm on responsible state behavior in public attribution thus seems to be a possible way forward.” (Yang, 2022, p. 7)

## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution

### The UN GGE stresses that accusations against states must be substantiated.

> “In this regard, the UN GGE has provided a sound basis by repeatedly emphasizing in its final reports that “the accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated.”48 Righteous in its nature, though, this norm only points out the need for accusations to be substantiated but fails to elaborate how. Vis-à-vis the legal deficiencies previously discussed, a norm on responsible public attribution should embody the following points.” (Yang, 2022, p. 8)

## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution

### States should consult prior to public cyber attributions to minimize disputes.

> “Starting with an out-of-the-box thought and a preliminary norm: states should make a formal request of consultation before making cyber attribution public; such consultation should be mandatory, confidential, and within a time limit. Such minor improvements to the process have proved to be rather useful in cutting down interstate disputes in other fields of international law, such as the World Trade Organization dispute settlement mechanism.49 If a similar mechanism exists in cyber conflict, the accusing state then has a way to consult privately with the accused state, seeking to have its interests met without forcing the latter into an awkward position. Most importantly, the substantiation problem may not be that contentious at this stage.” (Yang, 2022, p. 8)

## Toward a Norm on Responsible Public Attribution

### Clear evidentiary requirements are vital for responsible cyber attribution.

> “In a combined norm on the rules of attribution, evidentiary requirements and legal consequences of erroneous attribution could be termed as: 1. A state cannot be held responsible under international law solely because a problematic ICT activity was launched or otherwise originated from its territory or from its ICT infrastructure. 2. A state should substantiate its public attribution with an adequate level of evidence for crosschecking, by default to the extent of establishing a clear and convincing case, depending on the purpose and severity of its claim. 3. A state should refrain from taking responsive measures based on public attribution that has been inadequately substantiated, and it may take corresponding responsibility for making an erroneous or falsified attribution.” (Yang, 2022, p. 8)
