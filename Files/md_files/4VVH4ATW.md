# <h1>Evidentiary issues in international disputes related to state responsibility for cyber operations</h1>

## I.Introduction

### Evidentiary challenges in inter-state litigation are amplified in cyber operations.

> Evidentiary problems in inter-state litigation, in particular in relation to the attribution of certain unlawful conduct, are not peculiar to cyber operations.3 Well before the cyber age, in the Nicaragua Judgment the International Court of Justice (ICJ) conceded that “the problem is not…the legal process of imputing the act to a particular State … but the prior process of tracing material proof of the identity of the perpetrator.”4 As the United States declared in its views on information security submitted to the UN Secretary-General, then, the ambiguities of cyberspace “simply reflect the challenges…that already exists [sic] in many contexts.”5 It is undeniable, however, that these challenges are particularly evident in cyberspace, where identifying who is behind a cyber operation presents significant technical problems. As has been effectively observed, “the internet is one big masquerade ball. You can hide behind aliases, you can hide behind proxy servers, and you can surreptitiously enslave other computers to do your dirty work.”5(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 2)

### Allegations of Russian involvement in cyber attacks against Estonia reflect complex evidentiary issues.

> One needs only look at the three most famous cases of cyber attacks against states allegedly launched by other states to realize how thorny the problem of evidence in relation to cyber operations is. It has been claimed, in particular, that the Russian Federation was behind both the 2007 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Estonia and the 2008 cyber attacks against Georgia.7 These allegations were based on the following facts. In the Estonian case, the hackers claimed to be Russian, the tools to hack and deface were contained in Russian websites and chatrooms, and the attacks picked on May 9 (the day Russia celebrates Victory Day in Europe in World War II).8 Furthermore, although the botnets included computers based in several countries, it seems that at least certain attacks originated from Russian IP (internet protocol) addresses, including those of state institutions.9 According to the Estonian Defense Minister, the attacks were “unusually well-coordinated and required resources unavailable to common people.”10 The DDoS attacks also took place against the backdrop of the removal of a Russian war memorial from Tallinn city centre. Finally, Russia did not cooperate with Estonia in tracking down those responsible, and a request for bilateral investigation under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries was rejected by the Russian Supreme Procurature.10(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 2)

### Cyber attacks against Georgia are alleged to have state-sponsored coordination during armed conflict.

> The cyber attacks against Georgia started immediately before and continued throughout the armed conflict between the Caucasian state and the Russian Federation in August 2008. It seems that the Russian hacker community was involved in the cyber attacks and that coordination took place in the Russian language and in Russian or Russian-related fora.12 As in the Estonian case, it was claimed that the level of coordination and preparation suggested governmental support for the cyber attacks.13 Finally, IP addresses belonging to Russian state-operated companies were used to launch the DDoS attacks.14 Russia again denied any responsibility.14(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 2)

## I.Introduction

### The Stuxnet operation against Iran exemplifies a sophisticated inter-state cyber campaign attributed to the US and Israel.

> The third case of alleged inter-state cyber operation, and possibly the most famous of the three, is that of Stuxnet. In 2012, an article published in The New York Timesrevealed that the United States, with Israel’s support, had been engaging in a cyber campaign against Iran, codenamed “Operation Olympic Games,” to disrupt the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.16 Stuxnet, in particular, was allegedly designed to affect the gas centrifuges at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.17 Unlike other malware, the worm did not limit itself to self-replication, but also contained a “weaponized” payload designed to give instructions to other programs18 and is, in fact, the first known use of malicious software designed to produce material damage by attacking the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system of a national critical infrastructure.19 The allegations against the United States and Israel were based on journalistic interviews with current and former American, European, and Israeli officials and other experts, whose names are, however, not known.20 In a recent interview, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden also claimed that the NSA and Israel were behind Stuxnet.21 Symantec’s researchers suggested that Stuxnet’s code included references to the 1979 date of execution of a prominent Jewish Iranian businessman.22 Other circumstantial evidence includes the fact that the worm hit primarily Iran and was specifically targeted at the Natanz nuclear facility, as the worm would activate itself only when it found the Siemens software used in that facility, and the fact that the high sophistication of the attack, the use of several zero-day hacks and the insider knowledge of the attacked system it implied required resources normally unavailable to individual hackers. Israeli and US officials have neither denied nor confirmed involvement in the operation: in response to a question, President Obama’s chief strategist for combating weapons of mass destruction, Gary Samore, sardonically pointed out that “I’m glad to hear they are having troubles with their centrifuge machines, and the U.S. and its allies are doing everything we can to make it more complicated.”23 According to The Daily Telegraph, a video that was played at a retirement party for the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Gabi Ashkenazi, included references to Stuxnet as one of his operational successes as the IDF chief of general staff.23(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## I.Introduction

### Allegations of Chinese state involvement in cyber operations reveal ongoing cybersecurity tensions.

> Apart from the aforementioned well-known cyber attacks, allegations of state involvement have also been made in relation to other cyber operations, including cyber exploitation activities. The US Department of Defense’s 2013 Report to Congress, for instance, claims that some of the 2012 cyber intrusions into US government computers “appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military,” although it is not entirely clear on what grounds.25 According to the controversial Mandiant Report, “the sheer number of [hacking group] APT1 IP addresses concentrated in these Shanghai ranges, coupled with Simplified Chinese keyboard layout settings on APT1’s attack systems, betrays the true location and language of the operators.”26 The Report concludes that “APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China’s cyber threat actors.”27 According to the Chinese Defence Ministry, however, the report lacked “technical proof” that linked the IP addresses used by ATP1 to a military unit of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), as the attacks employed hijacked addresses.28 In May 2014, the US Department of Justice eventually brought charges against five members of the PLA for hacking into the computers of six organizations in western Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the United States to steal trade secrets, without providing much supporting evidence (if any at all) of the involvement of the defendants.28(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)

## I.Introduction

### Evidentiary issues in state responsibility for cyber operations have been largely overlooked in legal discussions.

> In spite of the obvious crucial importance of evidentiary issues, works on inter-state cyber operations, both above and below the level of the use of force, have so far focused on whether such operations are consistent with primary norms of international law and on the remedies available to the victim state under the jus ad bellum and the law of state responsibility, and have almost entirely neglected a discussion of the evidence the victim state needs to produce to demonstrate, either before a judicial body or elsewhere, that an unlawful cyber operation has been conducted against it and that it is attributable to another state.30 The first edition of the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare also does not discuss in depth evidentiary issues in the cyber context: the only references to evidence are contained in Rules 7 and 8.31 The present chapter aims to fill this gap. It will start with a brief account of the international law of evidence and will then discuss who has the burden of proof in relation to claims seeking remedies (including reparation) for damage caused by cyber operations. It will then analyze the standard of proof required in the cyber context. Finally, the possible methods of proof will be examined, distinguishing between those which are admissible and those which are inadmissible. The present chapter only deals with international disputes between states, and will not discuss evidentiary issues in relation to cyber crime before domestic courts. It also does not look at evidence before international criminal tribunals, as the focus is on state responsibility for cyber operations and not on the criminal responsibility of individuals.31(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 3)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### Evidence is essential for establishing state responsibility in international disputes.

> “Evidence” is “information…with a view of establishing or disproving alleged facts.”33 It is different from “proof” in that “‘proof’ is the result or effect of evidence, while ‘evidence’ is the “medium or means by which a fact is proved or disproved.”34 Evidence is normally required to provide proof of both the objective (be it an act or omission) and subjective elements of an internationally wrongful act, that is, its attribution to a state. A state invoking self-defense against cyber attacks, for instance, will have to produce evidence that demonstrates: (1) that the cyber attack actually occurred, that it was directed against it, and that its scale and effects reached the threshold of an “armed attack”35 and (2) that it was attributable to a certain state.36 For a state to invoke the right to take countermeasures, on the other hand, it may be sufficient to provide evidence that a cyber operation originated from a certain state and that that state did not exercise due diligence in terminating it, without necessarily having to prove attribution of the attack itself to the state.36 In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ clearly explained the distinction between the objective and subjective elements from an evidentiary perspective [o]ne of the Court’s chief di culties in the present case has been the determination of the facts relevant to the dispute...Sometimes there is no question, in the sense that it does not appear to be disputed, that an act was done, but there are con icting reports, or a lack of evidence, as to who did it...The occurrence of the act itself may however have been shrouded in secrecy. In the latter case, the Court has had to endeavour rst to establish what actually happened, before entering on the next stage of considering whether the act (if proven) was imputable to the State to which it has been attributed.37 The Court’s observations” (Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### Attributing cyber operations necessitates multiple layers of evidence.

> The Court’s observations were made against the backdrop of the secrecy that surrounded the US and Nicaraguan covert operations in central America,39 which is also a quintessential characteristic of cyber operations. In this context too, then, it is likely that evidence will be required both to establish to material elements of the wrongful act and to establish its attribution. It is still unclear, for instance, not only who is responsible for Stuxnet, but also whether the worm caused any damage and, if so, to what extent, which is essential in order to establish whether the cyber operation amounted to a use of force and, more importantly, whether it was an armed attack entitling the victim state to self-defense.39 As to establishing the subjective element of the internationally wrongful act, what is peculiar to cyber operations is that there are in fact three levels of evidence that are needed to attribute a cyber operation to a state: first, the computer(s) or server(s) from which the operations originate must be located; secondly, it is the individual that is behind the operation that needs to be identified; and thirdly, what needs to be proved is that the individual acted on behalf of a state so that his or her conduct is attributable to it.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### The standard of proof differs from the rules of attribution in international law.

> This leads us to an important specification: the standard of proof must be distinguished from the rules of attribution. The former is “the quantum of evidence necessary to substantiate the factual claims made by the parties.”41 The latter, on the other hand, determine the level of connection that must exist between an individual or group of individuals and a state for the conduct of the individuals to be attributed to the state at the international level. The rules of attribution for the purposes of state responsibility have been codified in the Part One of the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC), as well as having been articulated in the case-law of the ICJ.42 Evidence according to the applicable standard must be provided to demonstrate that the attribution test has been satisfied: in Nicaragua, for instance, the ICJ had to assess whether there was sufficient evidence that the United States had exercised “effective control” over the contras so that it could be held responsible for their violations of international humanitarian law.42(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 4)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### The burden of proof identifies which party must present evidence in legal proceedings.

> The standard of proof should also be distinguished from the burden of proof. The latter does not determine how much evidence, and of what type, is necessary to prove the alleged facts, but merely identifies the litigant that must provide that evidence. In other words, the burden of proof is “the obligation on a party to show that they have sufficient evidence on an issue to raise it in a case.”44 The burden of proof includes not only the “burden of persuasion,” but also the “burden of production,” that is, to produce the relevant evidence before a court.44(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 5)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### Evidence may influence political decisions and public perception in international conflicts.

> Evidence may be submitted not only to an international court or tribunal, but also to political organs (for instance to secure a favorable vote), or could be disseminated more widely for the purposes of influencing public opinion and gain support for certain actions or inactions.46 One could recall the evidence presented by the Reagan Administration before the UN Security Council to justify its 1986 strike on Tripoli as a measure of self-defense.47 When substantiating its 2001 armed operation against Afghanistan, the US Permanent Representative to the United Nations referred to the fact that the US government had “clear and compelling information that the Al-Qaeda organization, which is supported by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, had a central role in the [September 11, 2001] attacks,” without however going into further details.48 The same language was used by the Secretary-General of NATO.49 Evidence was also famously one of the controversial aspects of the 2003 US–UK intervention against Iraq.50 More recently, in the context of the proposed intervention to react against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, President Obama stated that attacking another country without a UN mandate and without “clear evidence that can be presented” would raise questions of international law.50 The political or judicial relevance of evidence may relate to the different phases of the same international dispute. For instance, the state invoking the right of self-defense against an armed attack by another state will normally try to justify the exercise of this right first before the international community and public opinion by providing evidence of the occurrence (or imminent occurrence) of the armed attack and of its attribution to the target state. If, as in the case of the Military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, a state subsequently brings the case before an international court, which has jurisdiction over the case, the evidence will have to be assessed by that court in order to establish international responsibility and its consequences, and in particular whether the requirements for the exercise of self-defense were met.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 5)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### There is no uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.

> The problem is that there is no uniform body of rules on the production of evidence in international law.51 There is no treaty provision that regulates evidentiary issues in non-judicial contexts and it is doubtful that international law has developed customary rules in that sense. As to the production of evidence in inter-state litigation, international courts, at least those of a non-criminal nature, normally determine their own standards in each case, which may considerably differ according to the nature of the court or the case under examination. As it is not possible to identify uniform evidentiary rules applicable in all cases and before all international courts, this chapter will focus on proceedings before the ICJ: this is because the ICJ is the main UN judicial organ, which deals, if the involved states have consented to its jurisdiction, with claims of state responsibility arising from the violation of any primary norm of international law. Our overall purpose is to establish whether rules on evidence may be identified that would apply to claims in inter-state judicial proceedings seeking remedies for damage caused by cyber operations. It should be borne in mind, however, that the conclusions reached with regard to the ICJ only apply to it and could not automatically be extended to other international courts.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 5)

## II.The International Law of Evidence

### Rules on the production of evidence before the ICJ are governed by specific statutory provisions.

> Rules on the production of evidence before the ICJ are contained in the ICJ Statute, the Rules of Court (adopted in 1978), and Practice Directions for use by states appearing before the Court, first adopted in 2001 and subsequently amended. In the following pages, the relevant rules on evidentiary issues contained in those documents, as well as those elaborated by the Court in its jurisprudence, will be applied to allegations related to cyber operations.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 5)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The burden of proof determines which party must provide evidence in international disputes.

> The burden of proof identifies the litigant that has the onus of meeting the standard of proof by providing the necessary evidence.53 Once the burden has been discharged according to the appropriate standard, the burden shifts to the other litigant, who has to prove the contrary. It is normally the party that relies upon a certain fact that is required to prove it (the principle, deriving from Roman law, onus probandi incumbit actori).54 This general principle of law, invoked consistently by the ICJ and other international courts and tribunals,55 “applies to the assertions of fact both by the Applicant and the Respondent.”56 The party bearing the burden of proof, therefore, is not necessarily the applicant, that is, the state that has brought the application before the tribunal, but the party “seeking to establish a fact,”57 regardless of its procedural position.58 For instance, the party (applicant or respondent) that relies on an exception, including self-defense, has the burden of proving the facts that are the basis for the exception.59 It should also be recalled that the distinction between applicant and respondent may not always be clear in inter-state litigation, especially when the case is brought before an international court by special agreement between the parties.59(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 6)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The burden of proof principle has limitations regarding undisputed facts and notorious knowledge.

> The onus probandi incumbit actori principle is subject to three main limitations. First, facts that are not disputed or that are agreed upon by the parties do not need to be proved.61 Secondly, the Court has relieved a party from the burden of providing evidence of facts that are “notorious” or “of public knowledge.”62 In Nicaragua, for instance, the Court found that “since there was no secrecy about the holding of the manoeuvres, the Court considers that it may treat the matter as one of public knowledge, and as such, sufficiently established.”63 As has been noted, “the notion of common or public knowledge has, over the years, expanded, given the wide availability of information on current events in the press and on the internet.”64 Reports on cyber incidents have also been published by companies like McAfee, Symantec, Mandiant, and Project Grey Goose and by think-tanks like NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE). These reports essentially contain technical analysis of cyber incidents and, with the possible exception of those of the CCDCOE, do not normally investigate attribution for legal purposes of those incidents in any depth (if at all). The fact that cyber incidents have received extensive press coverage, as in the case of Stuxnet, may also contribute to the public knowledge character of certain facts. In Nicaragua, however, the ICJ warned that “[w]idespread reports of a fact may prove on closer examination to derive from a single source, and such reports, however numerous, will in such case have no greater value as evidence than the original source.”65 The ICJ also held that the “massive body of information” available to the Court, including newspapers, radio, and television reports, may be useful only when it is “wholly consistent and concordant as to the main facts and circumstances of the case.”65(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 6)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The burden of proof applies to facts, not to legal principles, requiring proof of municipal law.

> Thirdly, the onus probandi incumbit actori principle only applies to facts, not to the law, which does not need to be proved (jura novit curia). It should be borne in mind, however, that, in inter-state litigation, municipal law is a fact that must be proved by the parties invoking it.67 Furthermore, the ICJ has often distinguished between treaty law and customary international law and has held that the existence and scope of customary rules, especially when of a regional character, must be proved by the parties, as one of their two elements, state practice, is factual.67 A party invoking national legislation or the existence of a general or cyber-specific custom in its favor, therefore, will bear the burden of producing relevant evidence before the Court.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 6)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Proposals to shift the burden of proof to the state of origin for cyber incidents are inconsistent with ICJ jurisprudence.

> Certain authors have suggested that the problems of identification and attribution in the cyber context could be solved by shifting the burden of proof “from the investigator and accuser to the nation in which the attack software was launched.”69 On that basis, it would be up to the state from whose cyber infrastructure the cyber operation originated to prove that it was not responsible for it and/or that it exercised due diligence not to allow the misuse of its infrastructure by others, and not to the claimant to prove the contrary. Similarly, it has been argued that “[t]he fact that a harmful cyber incident is conducted via the information infrastructure subject to a nation’s control is prima facie evidence that the nation knows of the use and is responsible for the cyber incident.”70 This, however, is not correct. First, mere knowledge does not automatically entail direct attribution, but only a potential violation of the due diligence duty not to allow hostile acts from one’s territory. What is more, the views arguing for a reversal of the burden of proof are at odds with the jurisprudence constante of the ICJ. In the Corfu Channel case, the Court famously found that the exclusive control exercised by a state over its territory “neither involves prima facie responsibility nor shifts the burden of proof” in relation to unlawful acts perpetrated there.71 The Court, however, conceded that difficulties in discharging the burden of proof in such cases may allow “a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.”72 This point will be further explored in section VI.73 In Armed Activities (DRC v Uganda), the ICJ also did not shift the burden of proving that Zaire had been in a position to stop the armed groups’ actions originating from its border regions, as claimed by Uganda in its counter-claim, from Uganda to the DRC, and, therefore, found that it could not “conclude that the absence of action by Zaire’s Government against the rebel groups in the border area is tantamount to ‘tolerating’ or ‘acquiescing’ in their activities.”73(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 7)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Exclusive territorial control of cyber infrastructure does not shift the burden of proof to the state.

> If one applies these findings in the cyber context, the fact that a state has exclusive “territorial” control of the cyber infrastructure from which the cyber operation originates does not per se shift the burden of proof and it is, therefore, still up to the claimant to demonstrate that the territorial state is responsible for the cyber operation or that it failed to comply with its due diligence duty of vigilance, and not to the territorial state to demonstrate the contrary.74(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 7)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Possession of evidence by one party does not shift the burden of proof to that party.

> Even beyond the principle of territorial control, the fact that relevant evidence is in the hands of the other party does not per se shift the burden of proof. In the Avena case, the ICJ held that it could not: accept that, because such information may have been in part in the hands of Mexico, it was for Mexico to produce such information. It was for the United States to seek such information, with sufficient specificity, and to demonstrate both that this was done and that the Mexican authorities declined or failed to respond to such specific requests. …The Court accordingly concludes that the United States has not met its burden of proof in its attempt to show that persons of Mexican nationality were also United States nationals.75(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 7)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Cyber operations conducted during armed conflict do not alter the standard burden of proof.

> The fact that cyber operations were conducted in the context of an armed conflict, as was the case of those against Georgia in 2008, also does not affect the normal application of the burden of proof. In Nicaragua, the ICJ recalled the Corfu Channel and Tehran Hostages judgments and found that “[a] situation of armed conflict is not the only one in which evidence of fact may be difficult to come by, and the Court has in the past recognized and made allowance for this.”77 Even in such circumstances, therefore, “it is the litigant seeking to establish a fact who bears the burden of proving it.”78 In the El Salvador/Honduras case, the Court stated that it “fully appreciates the difficulties experienced by El Salvador in collecting its evidence, caused by the interference with governmental action resulting from acts of violence. It cannot, however, apply a presumption that evidence which is unavailable would, if produced, have supported a particular party’s case; still less a presumption of the existence of evidence which has not been produced.”78(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 7)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The burden of proof remains unchanged despite the covert nature of cyber operations.

> The application of the onus probandi incumbit actori principle is also not affected by the possible asymmetry in the position of the litigants in discharging the burden of proof due to the fact that one has acted covertly (as is virtually always the case of cyber operations).80 As Judge Owada points out in his Separate Opinion attached to the Oil Platforms judgment, however, the Court should “take a more proactive stance on the issue of evidence and that of fact-finding” in such cases so to ensure that the rules of evidence are applied in a “fair and equitable manner” to both parties.80(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 7)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The precautionary principle does not justify a reversal of the burden of proof in cyber operations.

> Finally, it has been argued that a reversal of the burden of proof may derive from an application of the precautionary principle originating from international environmental law in cyberspace.82 The precautionary principle entails “the duty to undertake all appropriate regulatory and other measures at an early stage, and well before the (concrete) risk of harm occurs.”83 On this view, states would have an obligation to implement measures to prevent the possible misuse of their cyber infrastructure, in particular by establishing a national cyber security framework.84 Regardless of whether or not the precautionary principle, with its uncertain normativity, extends to cyberspace,85 it still would not lead to a reversal of the burden of proof from the claimant to the state from where the cyber operation originates. In the Pulp Mills case, the ICJ concluded that “while a precautionary approach may be relevant in the interpretation and application of the provisions of the Statute [of the River Uruguay], it does not follow that it operates as a reversal of the burden of proof.”86 The Court, however, did not specify whether the precautionary principle may result in at least a lowering of the standard of proof.86(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## III.Burden of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The ICJ is unlikely to accept a reversal of the burden of proof in cyber disputes due to complexities.

> In light of what we have just discussed, it can be concluded that it is unlikely that the ICJ would accept that there is a reversal of the burden of proof in the cyber context. As has been correctly argued, “suggesting a reversal of the burden of proof could easily lead to wrong and even absurd results given the possibility of routing cyber operations through numerous countries, and to the denouncing of wholly uninvolved and innocent States.”88 In the case of the 2007 DDoS campaign against Estonia, for instance, the botnets included computers located not only in Russia, but also in the United States, Europe, Canada, Brazil, Vietnam, and other countries.88 Difficulties in discharging the burden of proof, which are particularly significant in the context under examination, may, however, result in an alleviation of the standard of proof required to demonstrate a particular fact. It is to this aspect that the analysis now turns.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 8)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Common law and civil law systems have differing standards of proof.

> It is well-known that, while in civil law systems there are no specific standards of proof that judges have to apply as they are authorized to evaluate the evidence produced according to their personal convictions on a case-by-case basis, common law jurisdictions employ a rigid classification of standards, including (from the most stringent to the least) beyond reasonable doubt (i.e., indisputable evidence, used in criminal trials), clear and convincing (or compelling) evidence (i.e., more than probable but short of indisputable), and preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities (more likely than not, reasonably probable, normally used in civil proceedings).90 A fourth standard is that of prima facie evidence, which merely requires indicative proof of the correctness of the contention made.90(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 8)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The ICJ does not specify standards of proof in its proceedings.

> The Statute of the ICJ and the Rules of Court neither require specific standards of proof, nor indicate what methods of proof the Court will consider as being probative in order to meet a certain standard. The ICJ has to date avoided clearly indicating the standards of proof expected from the litigants during the proceedings.92 It has normally referred to the applicable standard of proof in the judgments, but at that point it is of course too late for the parties to take it into account in pleading their cases.92(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 8)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### There is no consensus on the appropriate standard of proof for the ICJ.

> There is then no agreement on what standard of proof the ICJ should expect from the parties in the cases before it. If, because of their nature, international criminal courts use the beyond reasonable doubt standard in their proceedings,94 the most appropriate analogy for inter-state litigation is not with criminal trials, but with certain types of civil litigation.95 In his Dissenting Opinion in the Corfu Channel case, Judge Krylov suggested that “[o]ne cannot condemn a State on the basis of probabilities. To establish international responsibility, one must have clear and indisputable facts.”96 Wolfrum argued that, while the jurisdiction of an international court over a case should be established beyond reasonable doubt, the ICJ has generally applied a standard comparable to that of preponderance of evidence used in domestic civil proceedings when deciding disputes involving state responsibility.97 Others have maintained that such a standard only applies to cases not concerning attribution of international wrongful acts, such as border delimitations, while when international responsibility is at stake, the standard is stricter and requires clear and convincing evidence.97(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 8)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### State litigation is challenging.

> It is, therefore, difficult, and perhaps undesirable,99 to identify a uniform standard of proof generally applicable in inter-state litigation, or even a predominant one: the Court “tends to look at issues as they arise.”100 This case-by-case approach, however, does not exclude that a standard of proof may be identified having regard to the primary rules in dispute, that is, “the substantive rules of international law through which the Court will reach its decision.”101 Indeed, when the allegation is the same, it seems logical that the evidentiary standard should also be the same.102 There are indications, for instance, that claims related to jus ad bellum violations, in particular in relation to the invocation of an exception to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations, have been treated as requiring “clear and convincing evidence.”103 In the Nicaragua judgment, the Court referred to “convincing evidence” of the facts on which a claim is based and to the lack of “clear evidence” of the degree of control exercised by the United States over the contras.104 In the Oil Platforms case, the ICJ rejected evidence with regard to Iran’s responsibility for mine laying that was “highly suggestive, but not conclusive” and held that “evidence indicative of Iranian responsibility for the attack on the Sea Isle City” was insufficient.105 In DRC v Uganda, the ICJ referred again to facts “convincingly established by the evidence,” “convincing evidence,” and “evidence weighty and convincing.”106 Beyond the ICJ, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission also found that there was “clear” evidence that events in the vicinity of Badme were minor incidents and did not reach the magnitude of an armed attack.107 All the above suggests that at least clear and convincing evidence is expected for claims related to the use of force. As self-defense is an exception to the prohibition of the use of force, in particular, the standard of proof should be high enough to limit its invocation to exceptional circumstances and, thus, avoid abuses.107(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Clear and convincing evidence may be necessary for cyber operations.

> If clear and convincing evidence is required at least in relation to claims related to the use of armed force, the question arises whether there is a special, and lower, standard in the cyber context, in particular for claims of self-defense against cyber operations. Indeed, “evidentiary thresholds that might have worked well in a world of conventional threats—where capabilities could be judged with high accuracy and the costs of false negatives to peace and security were not necessarily devastating—risk exposing states to unacceptable dangers.”109 There is of course no case-law in relation to claims arising out of inter-state cyber operations, so possible indications in this sense have to be found elsewhere. The Project Grey Goose Report on the 2008 cyber operations against Georgia, for instance, relies on the concordance of various items of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Russian government was responsible for the operations.110 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States claimed that “high-confidence attribution of identity to perpetrators cannot be achieved in a timely manner, if ever, and success often depends on a high degree of transnational cooperation.”111 In a Senate questionnaire in preparation for a hearing on his nomination to head of the US Cyber Command, General Alexander argued that “some level of mitigating action” can be taken against cyber attacks “even when we are not certain who is responsible.”112 Similar words were employed by his successor, Vice Admiral Michael S Rogers: “International law does not require that a nation know who is responsible for conducting an armed attack before using capabilities to defend themselves from that attack.”113 However, Vice Admiral Rogers also cautioned that “from both an operational and policy perspective, it is difficult to develop an effective response without a degree of confidence in attribution.”114 Overall, these views seem to suggest an evidentiary standard, based on circumstantial evidence, significantly lower than clear and convincing evidence and even than a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis that identification and attribution are more problematic in a digital environment than in the analogue world.114(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### A lower standard of proof in cyber operations could lead to false attributions.

> It is difficult, however, to see why the standard of proof should be lower simply because it is more difficult to reach it. The standard of proof exists not to disadvantage the claimant, but to protect the respondent against false attribution, which, thanks to tricks like IP spoofing, onion routing and the use of botnets, is a particularly serious risk in the cyber context. The aforementioned views are also far from being unanimously held, even within the US government: the Air Force Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations, for instance, states that attribution of cyber operations should be established with “sufficient confidence and verifiability.”116 A report prepared by Italy’s Parliamentary Committee on the Security of the Republic goes further and requires it to be demonstrated “unequivocally” (“in modo inequivocabile”) that an armed attack by cyber means originated from a state and was undertaken on the instruction of governmental bodies.117 The document also suggests that attribution to a state requires “irrefutable digital «evidence»” (“«prove» informatiche inconfutabili”), which—the Report concedes—is a standard which is very difficult to meet.118 Germany also highlighted the need for “reliable attribution” of malicious cyber activities in order to avoid “‘false flag’ attacks,” misunderstandings and miscalculations.119 In relation to the DDoS attacks against Estonia, a UK House of Lords document lamented that “the analysis of today is really very elusive, not conclusive and it would still be very difficult to act on it.”120 Finally, the AIV/CAVV Report, which has been endorsed by the Dutch government, requires “reliable intelligence…before a military response can be made to a cyber attack” and “sufficient certainty” about the identity of the author of the attack.121 In relation to the Report, the Dutch government also argued that self-defense can be exercised against cyber attacks “only if the origin of the attack and the identity of those responsible are sufficiently certain.”121(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Defense claims in both traditional and cyber attacks require clear evidence.

> All in all, clear and convincing evidence seems the appropriate standard not only for claims of self-defense against traditional armed attacks, but also for those against cyber operations: a prima facie or preponderance of evidence standard might lead to specious claims and false or erroneous attribution, while a beyond reasonable doubt standard would be unrealistic: in the Norwegian Loans case, Judge Lauterpacht emphasized that “the degree of burden of proof…adduced ought not to be so stringent as to render the proof unduly exacting.”123 As explained by Michael Schmitt, a clear and convincing standard “obliges a state to act reasonably, that is, in a fashion consistent with the normal state practice in same or similar circumstances. Reasonable states neither respond precipitously on the basis of sketchy indications of who has attacked them nor sit back passively until they have gathered unassailable evidence.”123(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 10)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Critiques of a high evidence standard in cyber operations are often exaggerated.

> Those who criticize a clear and convincing evidence standard for the exercise of self-defense against cyber operations rely on the fact that, due to the speed at which such operations may occur and produce their consequences, the requirement of a high level of evidence may in fact render it impossible for the victim state safely to exercise its right of self-defense. Such concerns, however, are exaggerated. Indeed, if the cyber attack was a standalone event that instantaneously produced its damaging effects, a reaction in self-defense would not be necessary. If, on the other hand, the cyber attack were continuing or formed of a series of smaller scale cyber attacks,125 the likelihood that clear and convincing evidence could be collected would considerably increase.125(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 10)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Serious allegations like international crimes may require a higher burden of proof.

> Having said that, there are also indications that the most serious allegations, such as those involving international crimes, require a higher standard to discharge the burden of proof.127 As Judge Higgins wrote in her Separate Opinion attached to the Oil Platforms judgment, “the graver the charge the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.”128 In Corfu Channel, the Court appeared to suggest that the standard of proof is higher for charges of “exceptional gravity against a State.”129 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ confirmed that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive. … The same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts” (and accordingly applies both to the objective and subjective elements of an international crime).130 The Court also found that assistance provided by Yugoslavia to the Bosnian Serbs had not been “established beyond any doubt.”131 Gravity is of course inherent in any jus cogens violation. Claims of reparation for cyber operations qualifying as war crimes, crimes against humanity or acts of genocide, therefore, will require “fully conclusive” evidence, not just evidence that is “clear and convincing.” As has been aptly suggested, however, “[a] higher standard of proof may only be justified if the Court is willing to balance this strict approach with a more active use of its fact-finding powers to make sure that claims for breaches of jus cogens norms are not doomed to fail merely on evidential grounds.”131(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 10)

## IV.Standard of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Different standards of proof may apply to violations of genocide obligations.

> In the Bosnian Genocide judgment, the Court also appeared to make a distinction between a violation of the prohibition of committing acts of genocide, for which evidence must be “fully conclusive,” and a violation of the obligation to prevent acts of genocide, where the Court required “proof at a high level of certainty appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation,”133 even though not necessarily fully conclusive.134 Such an approach appears justified by the different nature of the obligation breached: indeed, presumptions and inferences necessarily play a more significant role when the wrongful act to be proved consists of an omission, as in the case of the breach of an obligation to prevent.134 By the same token, it may be suggested that the standard of proof required to prove that a state has conducted cyber operations amounting to international crimes is higher than that required to prove that it did not exercise the necessary due diligence to stop its cyber infrastructure from being used by others to commit international crimes.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 11)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The ICJ lacks a definitive list of evidence methods for cyber operation cases.

> What type of evidence may be relied on in order to meet the required standard of proof and establish that a cyber operation has occurred, has produced damage, and is attributable to a certain state or non-state actor? The production of evidence before the ICJ is regulated by Articles 48 to 52 of its Statute and by the Rules of Court. There is, however, no list of the methods of proof available to parties before the Court nor any indication of their different probative weight. Article 48 of the ICJ Statute provides only that “[t]he Court shall…make all arrangements connected with the taking of evidence,” while Article 58 of the Rules of Court confirms that “the method of handling the evidence and of examining any witnesses and experts…shall be settled by the Court after the views of the parties have been ascertained in accordance with Article 31 of these Rules.”(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 11)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations

### Parties can generally produce any evidence before the ICJ, subject to time limits.

> As a leading commentator has observed, “[t]he International Court of Justice has construed the absence of restrictive rules in its Statute to mean that a party may generally produce any evidence as a matter of right, so long as it is produced within the time limits fixed by the Court.”136 Although it is primarily the parties’ responsibility to produce the evidence necessary to prove the facts alleged, the Court may also order the production of documents, call experts and witnesses, conduct site visits, and request relevant information from international organizations.137 In Nicaragua, for instance, the Court found that it was “not bound to confine its consideration to the material formally submitted to it by the parties.”138 In that judgment, the ICJ also emphasized the principle of free assessment of evidence, stating that “within the limits of its Statute and Rules, [the Court] has freedom in estimating the value of the various elements of evidence.”138(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 11)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations

### The subsequent sections will explore relevant proof methods for cyber operations.

> In the next pages, methods of proof that may be relevant in relation to cyber operations will be examined.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 11)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### ICJ prioritizes documentary evidence over oral evidence.

> Although there is no formal hierarchy between different sources, the ICJ has taken a civil law court approach and has normally given primacy to written documents over oral evidence.140 Documentary evidence includes “all information submitted by the parties in support of the contentions contained in the pleadings other than expert and witness testimony.”141 According to Rosenne, documentary evidence can be classified in four categories: “published treaties included in one of the recognized international or national collections of treaty texts; official records of international organizations and national parliaments; published and unpublished diplomatic correspondence and communiqués and other miscellaneous materials, including books, maps, plans, charts, accounts, archival material, photographs, films, legal opinions and opinions of experts, etc.; and affidavits and declarations.”141(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### The Court relies on voluntarily produced evidence from litigants.

> Although the Court has the power to call upon the parties to produce any evidence it deems necessary or to seek such evidence itself, it has normally refrained from doing so and has relied on that spontaneously produced by the litigants. All documents not “readily available” must be produced by the interested party. A “publication readily available” is a document “available in the public domain…in any format (printed or electronic), form (physical or on-line, such as posted on the internet) or on any data medium (on paper, on digital or any other media) [that] should be accessible in either of the official languages of the Court” and which it is possible to consult “within a reasonably short period of time.”143 The accessibility should be assessed in relation to the Court and the other litigant.144 The fact that a publication is “readily available” does not necessarily render the concerned facts public knowledge, but rather relieves the party from the burden of having to produce it (Article 56(4) of the Rules of Court).144 The facts, however, still need to be proved.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 6)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### Official state documents can establish state responsibility for cyber operations.

> Official state documents, such as national legislation, cyber doctrines, manuals, strategies, directives, and rules of engagement, may become relevant in establishing state responsibility for cyber operations. In Nicaragua, for instance, the responsibility of the United States for encouraging violations of international humanitarian law was established on the basis of the publication of a manual on psychological operations. According to the Court, “[t]he publication and dissemination of a manual in fact containing the advice quoted above must…be regarded as an encouragement, which was likely to be effective, to commit acts contrary to general principles of international humanitarian law reflected in treaties.”146 Not all state documents, however, have the same probative value: in DRC v Uganda, the Court dismissed the relevance of certain internal military intelligence documents because they were unsigned, unauthenticated, or lacked explanation of how the information was obtained.146(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 12)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### The ICJ lacks a doctrine of privilege, impacting evidence submission.

> Military cyber documents are frequently classified in whole or in part for national security reasons. According to the doctrine of privilege in domestic legal systems, litigants may refuse to submit certain evidence to a court on confidentiality grounds. No such doctrine exists before the ICJ.148 One could actually argue that there is an obligation on the litigants to cooperate in good faith with the Court in the proceedings before it, and, therefore, to produce all requested documents.149 There is, however, no sanction for failure to do so: Article 49 of the ICJ Statute limits itself to providing that “[t]he Court may, even before the hearing begins, call upon the agents to produce any document or to supply any explanations. Formal note shall be taken of any refusal.”150 While the ICTY has found that “to grant States a blanket right to withhold, for security purposes, documents necessary for trial might jeopardize the very function of the International Tribunal, and ‘defeat its essential object and purpose’,”151 the ICJ has been reluctant to draw inferences from the refusal of a party to produce confidential documents. The problem has arisen twice before the Court: in the Corfu Channel and in the Bosnian Genocide cases. In the former, the ICJ called the United Kingdom, pursuant to Article 49 of the Statute, to produce an admiralty order. The United Kingdom refused to produce the document on grounds of naval secrecy,152 and witnesses also refused to answer questions in relation to the document. The ICJ decided not to “draw from this refusal to produce the orders any conclusions differing from those to which the actual events gave rise.”153 In the Bosnian Genocide case, even though Bosnia and Herzegovina had called upon the Court to request Serbia and Montenegro to produce certain documents classified as military secrets, the Court decided not to proceed with the request, although it reserved the right subsequently to request the documents motu proprio.154 In its judgment, the ICJ limited itself to noting “the Applicant’s suggestion that the Court may be free to draw its own conclusions’ from the fact that Serbia and Montenegro had not produced the document voluntarily.155 However, it does not seem that the Court ultimately drew any inferences from Serbia’s non-disclosure of the classified documents.156 It should be noted that, in both the aforementioned cases, alternative evidence was available to the Court. It has been suggested that “it remains a matter of conjecture how the ICJ might respond in cases where a confidential communication is the only possible evidence to determine the veracity of a factual assertion, and no alternative materials are available.”157 A possible solution is that any classified information be produced in closed sittings of the court.157(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 12)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### UN documents are highly regarded as evidence by the ICJ.

> Documents of international organizations may also be presented as evidence. Overall, the Court has given particular credit to UN reports, Security Council resolutions and other official UN documents.159 In Bosnian Genocide, the ICJ stated that the probative value of reports from official or independent bodies “depends, among other things, on (1) the source of the item of evidence (for instance, partisan, or neutral), (2) the process by which it has been generated (for instance an anonymous press report or the product of a careful court or court-like process), and (3) the quality of the character of the item (such as statements against interest, and agreed or uncontested facts).”160 Several documents of international organizations address cyber issues. In particular, information security has been on the UN agenda since 1998 when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. Since then, the General Assembly has adopted a series of annual resolutions on the topic. The resolutions have called for the views of the UN member states on information security and established three Groups of Governmental Experts that have examined threats in cyberspace and discussed cooperative measures to address them. While the first Group, established in 2004, did not produce a substantive report, the second, created in 2009, issued a report in 2010,161 and the third Group, which met between 2012 and 2013, also adopted a final report containing a set of recommendations.162 In addition, the views of UN member states on information security are contained in the annual reports of the UN Secretary-General on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security.162(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 13)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### finding reports credible but lacks examples on cyber operations.

> The Court has also relied on fact-finding from commissions and other courts.164 In DRC v Uganda, the Court considered the Report of the Porter Commission, observing that neither party had challenged its credibility.165 Furthermore, the Court accepted that “evidence [included in the Report] obtained by examination of persons directly involved, and who were subsequently cross-examined by judges skilled in examination and experienced in assessing large amounts of factual information, some of it of a technical nature, merits special attention.”166 For these reasons, facts alleged by the parties that found confirmation in the Report were considered clearly and convincingly proved.167 There are, however, no examples of reports by judicial commissions in relation to cyber operations. One can at best recall the 2009 Report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia established by the Council of the European Union, which briefly addressed the cyber operations against Georgia. The Report, however, is not of great probative weight, as it did not reach any conclusion on their attribution or legality and simply noted that “[i]f these attacks were directed by a government or governments, it is likely that this form of warfare was used for the first time in an inter-state armed conflict.”167 Even if not of use to establish attribution, however, the Report could be relied on to establish that the cyber operations against Georgia did in fact occur.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 13)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### tank reports have limited evidentiary value.

> Documents produced by NGOs and think-tanks may also play an evidentiary role, albeit limited. In relation to cyber operations, the CCDCOE has prepared reports containing technical and legal discussion of the Estonia, Georgia, and Iran cases, as well as of other cyber incidents.169 Project Grey Goose produced an open source investigation into cyber conflicts, including the 2008 cyber attacks on Georgia. In this case, the Report concluded “with high confidence that the Russian government will likely continue its practice of distancing itself from the Russian nationalistic hacker community thus gaining deniability while passively supporting and enjoying the strategic benefits of their action.”170 Information security companies like Symantec, McAfee, and Mandiant also regularly compile detailed technical reports on cyber threats and specific incidents.171 In general, however, reports from NGOs and other non-governmental bodies have been considered by the ICJ as having less probative value than publications of states and international organizations, and have been used in a corroborative role only.172 In DRC v Uganda, for instance, the ICJ considered a report by International Crisis Group not to constitute “reliable evidence.”173 Similarly, in Oil Platforms the Court did not find publications such as Lloyd’s Maritime Information Service, the General Council of British Shipping and Jane’s Intelligence Review to be authoritative public sources, as it had no “indication of what was the original source, or sources, or evidence on which the public sources relied.”174 This “unequal treatment” of documents of international organizations and NGOs has been criticized: “the correct approach is for the Court to apply its general evaluative criteria to documents produced by NGOs just as it does to those generated by UN actors.”174(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 13)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### Press reports are treated with caution and often lack probative value.

> As far as press reports and media evidence are concerned, one may recall, in the cyber context, the already mentioned article in The New York Times attributing Stuxnet to the United States and Israel.176 The ICJ, however, has been very reluctant to accept press reports as evidence and has treated them “with great caution.”177 Press reports that rely only on one source, upon an interested source, or give no account of their sources have, therefore, been treated as having no probative value.178 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the Court dismissed an article in Le Monde qualifying it as “only a secondary source.”179 In Nicaragua, the Court held that, even when they meet a “high standard of objectivity,” it would regard the reports in press articles and extracts from books presented by the parties “not as evidence capable of proving facts, but as material which can nevertheless contribute, in some circumstances, to corroborating the existence of a fact, i.e., as illustrative material additional to other sources of evidence.”180 This was so provided that they were “wholly consistent and concordant as to the main facts and circumstances of the case.”181 It has been suggested that this expression means that “the press reports in question would have to confirm the facts as alleged by both of the parties, or confirm the facts that have not been denied or contested by the parties.”181(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 14)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:A. Documentary Evidence

### Press reports may contribute to public knowledge but do not enhance evidence weight.

> Apart from this, press reports may contribute, together with other sources, to demonstrate public knowledge of facts of which the Court may take judicial notice, thus relieving a party from having to discharge the burden of proof with regard to those facts.183 The fact that cyber incidents like Stuxnet have received extensive media coverage and that the article in The New York Times has been followed by many others, including in The Washington Post,184 would not, however, as such increase their probative weight or mean that the covered facts are of public knowledge: as already mentioned, in Nicaragua the ICJ noted that “[w]idespread reports of a fact may prove on closer examination to derive from a single source, and such reports, however numerous, will in such case have no greater value as evidence than the original source.”184(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 6)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:B Official statements

### Official statements from authorities hold significant evidentiary weight in international disputes.

> Statements made by official authorities outside the context of the judicial proceedings may play an important evidentiary role. In the Tehran Hostages case, for instance, the ICJ recalled that it had “a massive body of information from various sources concerning the facts and circumstances of the present case, including numerous official statements of both Iranian and United States authorities.”186 Statements “emanating from high-ranking official political figures, sometimes indeed of the highest rank, are of particular probative value when they acknowledge facts or conduct unfavourable to the State represented by the person who made them.”187 However, all depends on how those statements were made public: “evidently, [the Court] cannot treat them as having the same value irrespective of whether the text is to be found in an official national or international publication, or in a book or newspaper.”187 In other words, statements that can be directly attributed to a state are of more probative value.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 14)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:B Official statements

### Lack of official acknowledgment from Russia and China complicates establishing state responsibility for cyber operations.

> The US Department of Defense’s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations confirms that “[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as…public statements by officials.”189 There do not seem to be, however, any official statements by Russian or Chinese authorities directly or even indirectly acknowledging responsibility for the cyber operations against Estonia, Georgia, and the United States: on the contrary, involvement was denied. With regard to Stuxnet, when asked questions about the incident, US and Israeli authorities neither admitted nor denied attribution. Whether this allows inferences to be drawn is discussed in section VI.189(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 14)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:C. Witness testimony

### The Court permits witness testimony under certain conditions and has historically used it sparingly.

> Witnesses may be called to provide direct oral evidence by the Court and by the litigants: the latter case is conditioned upon the absence of objections by the other litigant or the recognition by the Court that the evidence is likely to be relevant.191 The Court may also put questions to the witnesses and experts called by the parties.192 The ICJ has not made extensive use of oral evidence.193 In Corfu Channel, for instance, naval officers were called to testify by the United Kingdom about the damage suffered by the Royal Navy ships and the nature and origin of the mines.194 Albania also called witnesses to testify the absence of mines in the Channel.195 Five witnesses were called by Nicaragua to testify in the Nicaragua case.196 In the same case, the Court noted that “testimony of matters not within the direct knowledge of the witness, but known to him only from hearsay” is not “of much weight.”196(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 15)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:C. Witness testimony

### Written witness evidence is accepted by the Court but is regarded as less probative than oral testimony.

> It is worth recalling that the Court has also accepted witness evidence given in written form and attached to the written pleadings, but it has treated it “with caution”198 and has generally considered it of a probative value inferior to that of direct oral witness testimony.199 Factors to be considered in assessing the probative weight of affidavits include time, purpose, and context of production, whether they were made by disinterested witnesses and whether they attest to the existence of facts or only refer an opinion with regard to certain events.199(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 15)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:D. Enquiry and experts

### The ICJ may appoint experts for technical inquiries, particularly in cyber technology cases.

> According to Article 50 of the ICJ Statute, “[t]he Court may, at any time, entrust any individual body, bureau, commission, or other organization that it may select, with the task of carrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion.”201 Enquiries have never been commissioned by the Court, which has rather relied on fact-finding reports from other sources.202 Experts may be necessary in cases of a highly technical nature or that involve expertise not possessed by the judges:202 it is likely, therefore, that the Court will appoint experts in cases involving cyber technologies. The Court, however, would not be bound by their report.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 15)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations:D. Enquiry and experts

### Parties can call experts as witnesses, who may provide crucial evidence in court proceedings.

> Experts may also be called by the parties.204 As to the form of their participation in the oral proceedings, in Pulp Mills the ICJ reminded the parties that “those persons who provide evidence before the Court based on their scientific or technical knowledge and on their personal experience should testify before the Court as experts, witnesses or in some cases in both capacities, rather than counsel, so that they may be submitted to questioning by the other party as well as by the Court.”205 In the Whaling in the Antarctic case, therefore, the experts called by both Australia and Japan gave evidence as expert witnesses and were cross-examined,206 and the Court relied heavily on their statements to conclude that the special permits granted by Japan for the killing, taking, and treating of whales had not been granted “for purposes of scientific research.”206(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations: E. Digital Evidence

### Digital forensics involves the processes of collecting and analyzing digital evidence without distinguishing it from physical evidence.

> Digital forensics “deals with identifying, storing, analyzing, and reporting computer finds, in order to present valid digital evidence that can be submitted in civil or criminal proceedings.”208 It includes the seizure, forensic imaging, and analysis of digital media, and the production of a report on the evidence so collected.209 It seems that most countries “do not make a legal distinction between electronic evidence and physical evidence. While approaches vary, many countries consider this good practice, as it ensures fair admissibility alongside all other types of evidence.”209 Of course, not only do data have to be collected, but they also need to be interpreted, and the parties may disagree on their interpretation.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 15)

## V.Methods of Proof and Cyber Operations: E. Digital Evidence

### Digital evidence alone is insufficient to establish state responsibility for cyber operations due to its volatility and challenges in attribution.

> Digital evidence, however, is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role to establish state responsibility for cyber operations, for several reasons. First, digital evidence is “volatile, has a short life span, and is frequently located in foreign countries.”211 Secondly, the collection of digital evidence can be very time consuming and requires the cooperation of the relevant internet service providers, which may be difficult to obtain when the attack originates from other states. Thirdly, although digital evidence may lead to the identification of the computer or computer system from where the cyber operation originates, it does not necessarily identify the individual(s) responsible for the cyber operation (as the computer may have been hijacked, or the IP spoofed). In any case, it will say nothing about whether the conduct of those individuals can be attributed to a state under the law of state responsibility.211(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### Presumptions are integral to public international law.

> As Judge ad hoc Franck emphasized in Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan, “[p]resumptions are necessary and well-established aspects of both common and civil law and cannot but be a part of the fabric of public international law.”213 Previously, in his Dissenting Opinion in Corfu Channel, Judge Azevedo had argued that “[i]t would be going too far for an international court to insist on direct and visual evidence and to refuse to admit, after reflection, a reasonable amount of human presumptions with a view to reaching that state of moral, human certainty with which, despite the risk of occasional errors, a court of justice must be content.”213(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 16)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### Legal and factual presumptions exist in international law.

> Although the difference is often blurred in inter-state litigation, presumptions may be prescribed by law (“legal presumptions,” or presumptions of law), or be reasoning tools used by the judges (presumptions of fact, or inferences).215 In other words, “[p]resumptions of law derive their force from law, while presumptions of fact derive their force from logic.”216 In international law, presumptions of law can derive from treaties, international customs, and general principles of law.217 According to Judge Owada in his Dissenting Opinion in the Whaling in the Antarctic case, for instance, good faith on the part of a contracting state in performing its obligations under a treaty “has necessarily to be presumed,”217 although the presumption is subject to rebuttal.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 16)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### Inferences are based on circumstantial evidence to establish state sponsorship.

> Inferences, or presumptions of fact, are closely linked to circumstantial evidence.219 In the Corfu Channel case, Judge Padawi Pasha defined “circumstantial evidence” as “facts which, while not supplying immediate proof of the charge, yet make the charge probable with the assistance of reasoning.”220 Inferences “convincingly” establishing state sponsorship for cyber operations are suggested in the US Department of Defense’s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations, including “the state of relationships between the two countries, the prior involvement of the suspect state in computer network attacks, the nature of the systems attacked, the nature and sophistication of the methods and equipment used, the effects of past attacks, and the damage which seems likely from future attacks.”221 In its reply to the UN Secretary-General on issues related to information security, the United States also claimed that “the identity and motivation of the perpetrator(s) can only be inferred from the target, effects and other circumstantial evidence surrounding an incident.”222 The commentary to Rule 11 of the Tallinn Manual refers to inferences from “the prevailing political environment, whether the operations portends the future use of military force, the identity of the attacker, any record of cyber operations by the attacker, and the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure),” in order to determine whether a cyber operation qualifies as a use of force under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.222(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 16)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### The ICJ is cautious in drawing inferences from secondary evidence.

> The ICJ, however, “has demonstrated an increasing resistance to the drawing of inferences from secondary evidence.”224 Only inferences to protect state sovereignty are normally drawn by the Court, while others are treated with great caution.225 Examples of situations where the ICJ has explored the possibility of drawing inferences include exclusive control of territory and non-production of documents.226 As to the first, it has been argued that the state from which the cyber operation originates has presumptive knowledge of such operation. US officials have claimed, for instance, that, from the control that the Iranian government exercises over the internet, it is “hard to imagine” that cyber attacks originating from Iran against US oil, gas, and electricity companies could be conducted without governmental knowledge, even in the absence of direct proof of state involvement.227 The same considerations may be extended to cyber operations originating from China and other states where access to the internet is under strict governmental control. The US Department of Defense’s Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations also claims that “[s]tate sponsorship might be persuasively established by such factors as…the location of the offending computer within a state-controlled facility.”228 In the literature, Garnett and Clarke have claimed that “in a situation where there have been repeated instances of hostile computer activity emanating from a State’s territory directed against another State, it seems reasonable to presume that the host State had knowledge of such attacks and so should incur responsibility.”229 At least certain of the cyber attacks against Estonia and Georgia originated from Russian IP addresses, including those of state institutions.230 The Mandiant Report also traced the cyber intrusions into US computers back to Chinese IP addresses.231 As has been seen, however, in the Corfu Channel case the ICJ held that “it cannot be concluded from the mere fact of the control exercised [by a state] over its territory…that that State necessarily knew, or ought to have known, of any unlawful act perpetrated therein.”232 Only if there are other indications of state involvement may territorial control contribute to establish knowledge.233 In Oil Platforms, the ICJ also refused to accept the US argument that the territorial control exercised by Iran over the area from which the missile against the Sea Isle City had been fired was sufficient to demonstrate Iran’s responsibility.234 These conclusions are transposed in the cyber context by Rules 7 and 8 of the Tallinn Manual, according to which neither the fact that a cyber operation originates from a state’s governmental cyber infrastructure nor that it has been routed through the cyber infrastructure located in a state are sufficient evidence for attributing the operation to those states, although it may be “an indication that the State in question is associated with the operation.”234 The Manual does not clarify what probative value this “indication” would have.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 17)

### Control of cyber infrastructure may influence methods of proving state knowledge.

> If control of cyber infrastructure is not on its own sufficient to prove knowledge of the cyber operations originating therefrom, and even less direct attribution, it may, however, have “a bearing upon the methods of proof available to establish the knowledge of that State as to such events.”235 In particular, [b]y reason of this exclusive control [within its frontiers], the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence. This indirect evidence is admitted in all systems of law, and its use is recognized by international decisions.236(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 17)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### Inferences gain value when direct proof is unavailable due to exclusive control.

> According to the Court, then, inferences become particularly valuable, and assume a probative value higher than normal, when a litigant is unable to provide direct proof of facts because the evidence is under the exclusive territorial control of the other litigant. Such indirect evidence “must be regarded as of special weight when it is based on a series of facts linked together and leading logically to a single conclusion.”238 The ICJ, therefore, coupled the exclusive territorial control by Albania with its silence about the mine laying and other circumstantial evidence, and concluded that Albania had knowledge of the mines.239 Transposed to the cyber context, the presence or origination of the hazard in the cyber infrastructure controlled by a state does not per se demonstrate knowledge by that state, but may contribute to such a finding if it is accompanied by other circumstantial evidence pointing in that direction. In Corfu Channel, the Court, however, specified that, when proof is based on inferences, these must “leave no room for reasonable doubt.”240 In the Bosnian Genocide case, the Court confirmed that in demonstrating genocidal intent “for a pattern of conduct to be accepted as evidence of its existence, it would have to be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent.”241 In any case, “no inference can be drawn which is inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence.”241(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 9)

### Determining exclusive territorial control poses challenges in cyberspace.

> Of course, the Court will first have to determine whether the party has “exclusive territorial control” of the cyber infrastructure from which the cyber operations originated (and, therefore, potentially of the evidence of who was responsible for them) before allowing the more “liberal” recourse to inferences. This may cause particular difficulties in case of armed conflict: in the DRC v Uganda case, for instance, whether Uganda had had control over Congolese territory was one of the issues in dispute.243 In the cyber context, determining whether a litigant has “territorial control” of the cyber infrastructure and whether such control is “exclusive” may be equally difficult to establish and is linked to the ongoing debate on the states’ creeping jurisdiction over the internet and cyberspace in general.244 In this context, it should be recalled that Rule 1 of the Tallinn Manual accepts that “[a] State may exercise control over cyber infrastructure and activities within its sovereign territory.”244(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 18)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### The ICJ has not consistently allowed liberal inferences in cases of territorial control.

> It should also be noted that the ICJ has not always allowed the “more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence” in cases of exclusive territorial control. In the Bosnian Genocide case, Bosnia and Herzegovina argued that, because of Serbia and Montenegro’s geographical situation, the standard of proof should be lower and that the respondent “had a special duty of diligence in preventing genocide and the proof of its lack of diligence can be inferred from fact and circumstantial evidence.”246 The Court rejected this reasoning and established Serbia and Montenegro’s responsibility for failure to prevent genocide not on the basis of inferences but on documentary evidence and ICTY testimony.246(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 18)

## VI.Presumptions and Inferences in the Cyber Context

### Refusal to disclose evidence may lead to negative inferences in human rights tribunals.

> Does refusal to disclose evidence allow negative inferences? Article 38 of the Rules of Procedure of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights provides that the facts alleged in the petition “shall be presumed to be true if the State has not provided responsive information during the period set by the Commission under the provisions of Article 37 of these Rules of Procedure, as long as other evidence does not lead to a different conclusion.”248 This is due to the different nature of human rights tribunals, where one of the parties is an individual and the other is a government, while disputes before the ICJ are between sovereign states. According to Article 49 of its Statute, the ICJ may only take “formal note” of the refusal to disclose evidence: this provision authorizes the Court to draw inferences but does not create a presumption of law.248 In any case, as has already been seen, in the Corfu Channel and the Bosnian Genocide cases the Court declined to draw any inferences from refusal to produce evidence, in the former case because there was a series of facts contrary to the inference sought. Of course, if the litigant decides not to produce certain evidence, it will bear the risk that the facts it claims will not be considered sufficiently proved.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 1)

## VII.Inadmissible Evidence

### The ICJ has no express rules on evidence admissibility, but may declare evidence inadmissible if produced late or not in prescribed form.

> There are no express rules on the admissibility of evidence in the ICJ Statute. Therefore, “[t]he general practice of the Court has been to admit contested documents and testimony, subject to the reservation that the Court will itself be the judge of the weight to be accorded to it.”250 Evidence may, however, be declared inadmissible because it has been produced too late or not in the prescribed form.251 Another example of inadmissible evidence is provided by the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the Factory at Chórzow case, where the ICJ’s predecessor held that it “cannot take account of declarations, admissions or proposals which the parties may have made in the course of direct negotiations when the negotiations in questions have not led to an agreement between the parties.”252 The underlying reason for the inadmissibility of such material is to facilitate the diplomatic settlement of international disputes through negotiations, so that the negotiating parties do not have to fear that what they say in the negotiating context may be used against them in subsequent judicial proceedings.252(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 18)

## VII.Inadmissible Evidence

### Evidence obtained through violations of international law raises questions about its admissibility and the legality of cyber espionage.

> Is evidence obtained through a violation of international law also inadmissible? Traditional espionage and cyber exploitation, used in support of traceback technical tools, may be a helpful instrument to establish proof of state responsibility for cyber operations.254 India has noted that “[c]yber security intelligence forms an integral component of security of cyber space in order to be able to anticipate attacks, adopt suitable counter measures and attribute the attacks for possible counter action.”255It is doubtful whether the above activities constitute internationally wrongful acts, although one commentator has argued, for instance, that cyber espionage may be a violation of the sovereignty of the targeted state whenever it entails an unauthorized intrusion into cyber infrastructure located in another state (be it governmental or private).256 Data monitoring and interceptions may also be a violation of international human rights law.256(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 19)

## VII.Inadmissible Evidence

### The admissibility of evidence obtained through wrongful acts is not explicitly barred by the ICJ, allowing for reliance on such evidence in certain cases.

> Assuming, arguendo, that espionage and cyber exploitation are, at least in certain instances, internationally wrongful acts, what is the probative value of the evidence so collected? There is no express rule in the Statute of the ICJ providing that evidence obtained through a violation of international law is inadmissible. It is also not a general principle of law, as it seems to be a rule essentially confined to the US criminal system.258 As Thirlway argues, the rule in domestic legal systems is motivated by the need to protect the defendant against the wider powers of the prosecutor and its possible abuses: in inter-state litigation, there is no criminal trial and no dominant party, as the litigants are states in a position of sovereign equality.259 In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ did not dismiss evidence illegally obtained by the United Kingdom in Operation Retail; on the contrary, it relied on it in order to determine the place of the accident and the nature of the mines.260 In fact, Albania never challenged the admissibility of the evidence acquired by the British Navy,261 and the Court did not address the question. What it found was not that the evidence had been illegally obtained, but that the purpose of gathering evidence did not exclude the illegality of certain conduct.262 In general, “the approach of the Court is to discourage self-help in the getting of evidence involving internationally illicit acts, not by seeking to impose any bar on the employment of evidence so collected, but by making it clear that such illicit activity is not necessary, since secondary evidence will be received and treated as convincing in appropriate circumstances.”262 In a cyber context, this means that the fact that direct evidence is located in the computers or networks of another state does not entitle the interested litigant to access them without authorization to submit it in the proceedings, but allows the Court to give more probative weight to circumstantial evidence.(Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 19)

## VIII.Conclusions

### The ICJ's rules on evidence regarding cyber operations maintain the burden of proof on the alleging party.

> “There are a number of main conclusions that can be drawn from the application to cyber operations of the ICJ’s rules and case-law on evidence: • The burden of proof does not shift in the cyber context and continues to rest on the party that alleges a certain fact. • Whilst it is uncertain that a uniform standard of proof applicable to all cases involving international responsibility for cyber operations can be identi ed, it appears that claims of self-defense against cyber operations, like those against kinetic attacks, must be proved with clear and convincing evidence. On the other hand, fully conclusive evidence is needed to prove that a litigant conducted cyber operations amounting to international crimes, and a slightly less demanding standard seems to apply when what needs to be proved is that the state did not exercise due diligence to stop its cyber infrastructure from being used by others to commit international crimes. • The Court may take “formal note” of the refusal of a party to present classi ed cyber documents, but it has so far refrained from drawing negative inferences from the non-production of documents. In any case, any such negative inferences could not contradict factual conclusions based on consistent evidence produced by the parties. • The Court gives more probative weight to o cial documents of states and international organizations such as the United Nations. NGO reports and press articles on cyber incidents are only secondary sources of evidence that may be useful to corroborate other sources or to establish the public knowledge of certain facts, providing they are su ciently rigorous and only when they are “wholly consistent and concordant as to the main facts and circumstances of the case”. • The drawing of inferences is approached by the ICJ with great caution. When there are objective di culties for a litigant to discharge the burden of proof because the direct evidence lies within the exclusive territorial control of the other litigant, including its cyber infrastructure, a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact is admissible providing that they leave no room for reasonable doubt. • Even if a litigant obtains evidence illegally, for example, through an unauthorized intrusion into the computer systems of another state, the evidence so obtained may be taken into account by the Court, although the purpose of collecting evidence does not exclude the illegality of the conduct.” (Marco Roscini e Roscini, 2015, p. 20)
