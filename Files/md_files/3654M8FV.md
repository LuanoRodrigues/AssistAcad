# <h1>Attribution of cyber operations: an international law perspective on the <em>Park Jin Hyok</em> case</h1>

## Introduction

### The article analyzes the evolving landscape of cyber operations and the urgent need for improved attribution laws.

> “In the time that it will take you to read this article, numerous hostile cyber operations will be launched around the world, some of which will inevitably impact on individual States’ political interests or national security.1 Not so long ago, it was generally thought that those responsible for such cyber incidents ‘can cover their traces, stay anonymous online, and hide behind the attribution problem’.2 Accordingly, victim States maintained an uneasy and nervous silence about who, in their view, was to blame. However, since the early 2010s, the tide has been turning3 and multiple States have come forward with—sometimes detailed, sometimes less so—public statements attributing malicious cyber operations to other States.4 The next milestone will be the first case before an international tribunal where such claims will be tested against the applicable international law. When that happens, clear guidance will be urgently needed on the methodological, procedural, and substantive aspects of attribution of cyber operations from the perspective of international law. This article examines a recent high-profile case brought by the US authorities against Mr Park Jin Hyok, an alleged North Korean hacker, to provide such analysis.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 2)

## Introduction

### Victim States are increasingly attributing cyber attacks to specific actors, exemplified by the WannaCry incident.

> “Reflecting the trend noted earlier, the incidents of which Mr Park stands accused in the US have been subject to public attribution by several of the victim States. On 19 December 2017, the UK Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon attributed the WannaCry ransomware incident to the so-called Lazarus Group, an actor linked to North Korea.5 According to Minister Ahmad, the WannaCry incident impacted 300,000 computers in 150 countries including 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts.6 Although he noted that it was highly likely that ‘North Korean actors’ had orchestrated the ransomware campaign, his statement stopped short of attributing the incident to North Korea itself.7 By contrast, that same day, a US government official said: ‘After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea.’8 This difference between the two statements reflects the difficulty of attributing cyber operations by States to other States.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 2)

## Introduction

### International law has established standards for attributing actions to States, but these need to adapt to the cyber context.

> “To that end, international law has gradually developed standards, which determine whether an act of a particular individual is to be characterized in law as an act of the State9—in other words, whether that act is to be attributed to the said State.10 These standards, codified in the 2001 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereafter ‘Articles on State Responsibility’ or ASR), are very much a product of the pre-cyber era.11 Hence, the requirements that they impose are an uneasy match for the fluid and flexible relationships that have come to characterize the online world.12 What is more, if the responsible State uses an individual or an entity ostensibly unrelated to that State and then does not permit outside investigation, it becomes exceedingly difficult for foreign States to gather the factual evidence that they may need for attribution purposes.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 3)

## Introduction

### There is ongoing debate on whether cyber operations violate State sovereignty, complicating legal interpretations.

> “The problem is further compounded by the uncertainty as to the precise interpretation of specific substantive rules of international law in the cyber context. While there is a broad consensus to the effect that existing international law applies in cyberspace,13 much controversy remains with respect to individual international legal rules. The most contentious ongoing debate surrounds the application of the principle of sovereignty in the cyber environment.14 For some, including the UK, cyber operations do not violate the sovereignty of a State per se, because sovereignty is a principle of international law that guides State interactions, but does not add to other prohibitive legal rules, including the prohibition of intervention. 15 For others, including France and the Netherlands, the prohibition on the violation of the sovereignty of other States is a primary rule of international law, the breach of which is an internationally wrongful act.16 The difference between these two positions is crucial with respect to incidents such as those discussed in thisarticle, which do not amount to coercion against a State, thus rendering rules on intervention inapplicable.17 The law governing cyber operations which fall below the threshold of intervention certainly needs further clarity, but this is not the place to address these issues and this article will accordingly not consider issues of primary law any further.18” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4)

## Introduction

### This article primarily focuses on issues of attribution, separating it from the question of compliance with international obligations.

> “By contrast, our focus is on issues related to attribution. We acknowledge that it is controversial whether all operations discussed herein constitute breaches of specific international obligations. However, our analytical approach is based on the fact that the question of attribution logically precedes the assessment of conformity of a given act with the applicable international obligations.19 Accordingly, this article examines the law of attribution and does not consider, except where expressly noted, the element of breach.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4)

## Introduction

### The article discusses the lack of a coherent international law concerning evidence standards in attribution.

> “A final preliminary remark is in order as regards the evidentiary standards and rules discussed in this article. In that respect, it should be cautioned that there is at present no universal and coherent body of law that can be described as the international law of evidence. 20 Every international adjudicative organ is subject to its own standards for the production, collection, and evaluation of evidence, some of which are established in their statutes or rules of procedure, while others have evolved through the practice of these tribunals.21 In this article, we focus on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) due to its undoubted prominence on the international plane as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.22 We believe that this analysis illustrates the extent of flexibility accepted in proving attribution in inter-State disputes. However, it should be borne in mind that other tribunals may well use slightly or markedly different approaches to the procedural issues we discuss, including the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect evidence. By the same token, outside of the judicial context, the ‘attribution’ of cyber operations might achieve its political aims whether or not it satisfies the legal standards applied by any of these tribunals including the ICJ. In that regard, each State must determine ‘for itself its legal situation vis-à-vis other States’23 and it is then accountable for any measures taken on the basis of that determination.24” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 4)

## Introduction

### The purpose of the article is to examine international law of attribution in relation to the North Korean cyber operations.

> “To summarize, the purpose of this article is to examine the existing substantive and procedural international law on attribution against the backdrop of the alleged North Korean hostile cyber operations including WannaCry. We base our analysis on the evidence produced in the US domestic criminal proceedings against Mr Park. Due to the nature of those proceedings, that evidence does not directly concern the attributability of Mr Park’s alleged conduct to North Korea as a matter of international law. However, the FBI’s affidavit presented in that case stands out for its detailed and wide-ranging information on the attribution of cyber operations. Given the absence of other comparable documents published by governments on the issue of attribution, we chose this affidavit as the vehicle for our analysis.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 5)

## Introduction

### The article outlines its structure, detailing the analysis and sections to be covered regarding Mr. Park's case.

> “The article is structured as follows. We begin by introducing the case against Mr Park and the relevant aspects of the evidence adduced against him (section 2). We then consider whether the publicly available evidence, assuming its accuracy, would in principle suffice to attribute the alleged conduct to North Korea (section 3). In the next step, we analyse this evidence against the ICJ’s jurisprudence on the standard of proof and on the probative value of indirect or circumstantial evidence (section 4). This analysis reveals the need for objective impartial assessment of the available evidence and we thus continue by considering possible international attribution mechanisms (section 5). In the final step, we ask to what extent the principle of due diligence may mitigate the deficiencies of the existing attribution law (section 6).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 5)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### The Park Jin Hyok case exemplifies evidence in domestic proceedings on cybercrime.

> “There has so far been no case before the ICJ or other international tribunals addressing the State responsibility arising from cyber operations.25 However, in domestic criminal proceedings, there are cases where investigators provide evidence to establish who the attacker was.26 The United States of America v Park Jin Hyok is a paradigmatic example. In a 172-page-long affidavit published in June 2018, a special agent of the FBI argued that Mr Park was a member of the conspiracy behind many cyber incidents, including the 2014 operation against Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), the 2016 operation against the Bangladesh Bank, and the 2017 WannaCry incident.27 According to the affidavit, the operation against SPE rendered thousands of SPE computer terminals inoperable28 and the operation against Bangladesh Bank caused a loss of approximately $81,000,000.29 With respect to WannaCry, the affidavit echoed the UK assessment mentioned earlier and noted that dozens of NHS trusts and hundreds of other NHS organizations in the UK were infected by the virus, resulting in issues with diagnostic equipment and thousands of patient appointment cancellations.30” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 6)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### A visual representation of evidence in the Park case illustrates attribution challenges.

> “For greater clarity, we have designed a visual representation of the evidence adduced in the affidavit (Figure 1). As this affidavit concerns the criminal prosecution of an individual and it does not focus on the North Korean government, the evidence showing the attribution to the North Korean government is relatively limited. The figure is thus necessarily a simplification, but we include it here in order to illustrate the logic and methodology that may be used to establish attribution of cyber operations.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 6)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### The connections of WannaCry versions indicate a common authorship in cyber operations.

> “At the bottom of the figure, WannaCry Version 2 is shown as a blue box. The WannaCry ransomware used in the widespread incidents in 2017 exploiting the vulnerability of Microsoft Windows called ‘CVE-2017-0144’, was called WannaCry Version 2.31 The earlier versions of WannaCry are shown in the blue box next to WannaCry Version 2, while the two major cyber operations, which are believed to have connections with Mr Park, are shown in blue boxes further to the right, namely the operation against SPE and the operation against Bangladesh Bank. Red boxes represent IP addresses as well as e-mail and Facebook accounts used directly or indirectly in the cyber operations. Black and red arrows indicate the links between the various elements, and white boxes explain these links.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 7)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### Similarities among WannaCry versions suggest they are linked to the same authors.

> “The affidavit explains that WannaCry Version 2 has very strong similarities with WannaCry Versions 0 and 1, which indicates that these versions were all created by the same author or authors.32 The affidavit also explains the similarities between the earlier versions of WannaCry and other malware used in other operations, including those against SPE and Bangladesh Bank.33” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 7)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### Evidence shows Mr. Park shared accounts with other suspects with ties to cyber operations.

> “The suspect in this case is Mr Park, shown in the top left part of Figure 1.34 According to the affidavit, Mr Park and Kim Hyon Woo were using the same e-mail account of ‘ttykim1018’ and are believed to be the same person with a different alias.35 This e-mail address and another address ‘tty198410’ shared a large encrypted data box and this latter e-mail address is also believed to be used by the same person.36 The ‘tty198410’ account was also used as a secondary account in the registration of another account named ‘watsonhenny’, seen on the right-hand side of the figure, which had been used in the cyber operations against SPE and Bangladesh Bank.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 7)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### The affidavit underscores the circumstantial nature of evidence in cyber crime cases.

> “In summary, the evidence adduced in the affidavit indicates the following features: 1. Because perpetrators utilize many layers of aliases and proxies, available evidence tends to be circumstantial or indirect. 2. Due to the multiple layers of aliases and proxies, the evidence on the use of various IP addresses and e-mail accounts across many States plays a crucial role in connecting cyber operations to a certain individual or entity. In the affidavit, there are several references to evidence provided by other States, including the UK and Poland,41 which highlights the importance of international cooperation in this regard. 3. As direct evidence showing connection to actual cyber operations is difficult to find, the similarity of the programmes used for various operations plays a key role in proving the connection.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 8)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### Evidence links multiple cyber operations to the same conspiracy involving Mr. Park.

> “According to the affidavit, the evidence on the connections among all the red boxes on Figure 1 show that they constitute the same overall conspiracy involving Mr Park or Mr Kim in all of these cyber operations.42 The malware used in these operations displays strong similarities, and, according to the affidavit, the similarities between different samples of malware demonstrate that their authors very likely had access to the same collection of original source code. 43 Therefore, the evidence adduced in the affidavit strongly indicates that all these cyber operations had the same authors, including Mr Park.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 8)

## 2 PARK JIN HYOK CASE: SALIENT FEATURES

### The affidavit's evidence regarding North Korean government ties is limited but significant.

> “By contrast, as the affidavit is not against the North Korean government, it does not concentrate on proving links between these operations and the North Korean government. Accordingly, the evidence contained in the affidavit is rather limited as far as those connections are concerned. Still, it points out the following:1. Chosun Expo was originally established as a joint venture between North Korea and South Korea and, following the South Korean withdrawal from the business, it was maintained by North Korea.44 A number of Chosun Expo’s employees, including Mr Park, were dispatched to Dalian, China, and while there, they were being monitored by a ‘separate political attaché’ from North Korea. 45 The affidavit additionally stated that these employees kept only a very small fraction of their salary, remitting the rest to the North Korean government.46 2. Some of the e-mail accounts used in hostile cyber operations had also been accessed by North Korean government officials. For example, the e-mail account ‘watsonhenny’ played a key role in operations targeting SPE, Bangladesh Bank, and other victims.47 This same account was repeatedly used by a North Korean government representative for official DPRK business.48 3. Due to the strict control of the access to and use of the internet in North Korea, any extensive reliance on cyber capabilities from North Korean IP addresses is very likely regime-sanctioned. Given that many of the operations discussed in the affidavit were in fact launched from such IP addresses, it is likely that the DPRK government had at least known of and possibly approved these operations.49 4. After SPE announced the release of the movie ‘The Interview’, which was to depict a fictional Kim Jong-Un in unfavourable light, the North Korean government threatened retaliation in a letter sent to the US National Security Council.50 Following the operation against SPE, North Korea issued a long statement praising the authors, while carefully disavowing any responsibility for the operation.51” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 9)

### The next section will analyze linkages for attributing cyber conduct to North Korea.

> “In the following section, we focus on these alleged linkages and analyse whether, if accepted at face value, they would suffice for the attribution of the conduct underlying the relevant hostile cyber operations to North Korea under international law.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 9)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Attribution of cyber operations to North Korea hinges on connections between Mr. Park and the state.

> “As shown in the preceding section, the affidavit in the Park case suggests a number of connections between the alleged authors of the relevant hostile cyber operations and North Korea. In its executive summary, the affidavit even asserted that Mr Park and his accomplices were working ‘on behalf of ’ the North Korean government.52 Such a formulation is particularly significant from the perspective of international law as the question of attribution essentially relates to ‘which persons should be considered as acting on behalf of the State, i.e. what constitutes an “act of the State” for the purposes of State responsibility’.53 Accordingly, the question analysed in this section is whether any of the alleged linkages might suffice to establish attribution of Mr Park’s and others’ wrongdoing to North Korea under international law.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 9)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### The US has publicly attributed cyber incidents like WannaCry to North Korea and imposed sanctions.

> “At a political level, the United States has made it clear that it held North Korea accountable for these incidents. In particular, the US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Chosun Expo on the same day as the criminal charges against Mr Park were unsealed.54 It stated that it was sanctioning the company ‘for being an agency, instrumentality, or controlled entity of the Government of North Korea’. 55 The statement made it clear that the US did not see Chosun Expo as an autonomous actor; instead, the statement noted that it was ‘North Korea [who] has demonstrated a pattern of disruptive and harmful cyber activity’ and that the US policy was ‘to hold North Korea accountable’.56 In a press briefing held a few months later at the White House, the then Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert added expressly that ‘the United States [was] publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea’.57 In addition, several private actors were of the same view,58 including, most prominently, Microsoft.59” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 10)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### International law presumes non-State actors' conduct is not attributable to states.

> “Modern international law begins from the presumption that the conduct of non-State actors such as private companies or individuals is not attributable to States.60 In this respect, the law is based on the voluntaristic premise that only acts willed by an autonomous person may be attributed to that person.61 Accordingly, a legally meaningful and sufficient link must be found between a particular conduct and a State in order for that State to be deemed in law to have willed for that conduct to occur. In this regard, several such forms of linkages between Mr Park’s alleged behaviour and North Korea should be considered to determine the attribution issue concerning these incidents.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 10)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Attribution of cyber actions to North Korea requires evidence of Park's official status.

> “The first of these linkages—or, more precisely, modes of attribution—is the connection that exists between the conduct of a State organ and the State that that organ is a part of (Article 4 of the Articles on State Responsibility). For instance, cyber operations conducted by the US Cyber Command personnel are attributable to the US given that the Cyber Command is part of the US armed forces and thus a State organ. 62 Similarly, operations conducted by North Korea’s intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, are attributable to North Korea. 63 However, publicly available sources give little indication that Mr Park belonged to any particular organ of North Korea. The affidavit comes closest to such assessment when it says that Mr Park ‘was a programmer employed by the government of North Korea’.64 To be sure, if he had formally been an employee of the North Korean government, that would have made him a State organ and his conduct in that capacity would have been attributable to North Korea.65 However, this sentence is found in the executive summary section of the affidavit and a careful examination of the remainder of the document reveals that the sentence—likely inadvertently—omits a crucial link in the chain of connection between Mr Park and the government: the company Chosun Expo. The rest of the text makes it clear that he was in fact employed by that company, which the investigators described only as a ‘front’ of the North Korean government.66 In any event, there seems to be no direct evidence suggesting that Mr Park was either formally employed by the government or otherwise formally integrated in the structure of the North Korean government at the time of these cyber operations. As such, there seems to be no direct evidence showing that his conduct was attributable to North Korea under Article 4.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 11)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Attributing conduct requires showing Mr. Park was part of a State organ.

> “The second potentially applicable mode of attribution relates to entities empowered to exercise the governmental authority of a State (Article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility). Such entities need not be part of the formal structures of a State and they normally enjoy a legal personality separate from that of the State.67 In theory, a company such as Chosun Expo could thus qualify—but it would have to be established that it was actually empowered by the North Korean domestic law to exercise prerogatives of public power on behalf of the State.68 In practice, there is no direct evidence that Chosun Expo was given such powers. It appears that all known links between the North Korean government and the company were of an operational and practical, rather than formal or legislative, nature. 69 Accordingly, there is no direct evidence showing that Mr Park’s conduct while in employment of Chosun Expo was attributable to North Korea under Article 5.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 11)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Chosun Expo's attribution depends on its legal empowerment by North Korean law.

> “The third mode of attribution relevant to Mr Park’s case concerns attribution of the conduct of persons acting under the instructions, direction, or control of a State (Article 8 of the Articles on State Responsibility). These three standards are disjunctive—in other words, it suffices that one of them be met for the relevant conduct to be imputed to the State in question.70 Each of the standards is slightly different, but they share a common feature in the need to establish a form of subordination between the non-State actor and the potentially responsible State.71” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 11)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Attribution under Article 8 requires establishing a control relationship between Park and North Korea.

> “With respect to the first standard of ‘instructions’, Mr Park and his collaborators would have to have been factually subordinate to North Korea at the specific moment when the government had supposedly decided to commit the incidents in question. In addition, the hackers would had to have been ‘specifically charged’72 by North Korea to undertake the relevant cyber operationsbut no such ‘smoking gun’ appears to have materialized. By contrast, the mere fact that the hackers and the government have shared their political goals and aims73 does not suffice for the purposes of attribution under the ‘instructions’ heading.74” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 11)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Subordination under instructions is essential for attribution to North Korea.

> “There are some indications that the connection between Mr Park and North Korea might have fulfilled the second criterion of ‘directions’. This standard is met if an organ of a State ‘provided the direction pursuant to which the perpetrators of the wrongful act acted’.75 With respect to the “WannaCry incident, the US Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert expressly said that ‘[w]e’re comfortable in this case ... that is [sic] was directed by the government of North Korea.’76 As the WTO Appellate Body stated in the 2005 US-DRAMS report, the fact of such direction is normally evidenced by ‘some form of threat or inducement’.77 With respect to Chosun Expo, there is some evidence of financial and disciplinary subordination of its employees to the North Korean government, suggesting that these employees had to remit a large part of their salary to the government while they were dispatched to China and that their actions in China were monitored by a North Korean political attaché.78 In our view, this does not by itself suffice to establish a continuous relationship of subordination between North Korea and Chosun Expo required by the law.79 However, if such additional evidence was found, particularly if it demonstrated that North Korea led the steps to be taken in the commission of the operations in question,80 a plausible case could be made that the incidents were attributable under the ‘directions’ criterion.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 12)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Evidence suggests possible direction from North Korea regarding Park's actions.

> “Next, the conduct of Mr Park and his accomplices could be attributed through the third criterion of ‘control’. In this regard, it would have to be proved that North Korea had ‘effective control’81 of the operations in the course of which the relevant potential violations of international law were committed.82 This means that North Korea would have had to go beyond merely supporting Chosun Expo through financing, organizing, training or equipping;83 it would have to have been able to control the beginning of the relevant operations, the way they were carried out, and their end.84 This is obviously a very high bar and the information in the public domain seems to fall well short of it. For instance, the affidavit mentions that the accounts from which the hostile operations were launched were used without much restriction, which in the specific heavilymonitored North Korean context suggests that the use of these accounts ‘was likely regimesanctioned and approved’.85 However, even if a State knows of certain acts of a non-State actor, those acts could still have been committed without the control of the State in question.86 General approval of the use of accounts, which happen to be used for such acts, does not necessarily establish ‘effective control’ for the purposes of attribution under international law either.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 12)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Effective control by North Korea over Park's conduct is difficult to demonstrate.

> “As a final possible mode of attribution, it should be considered whether North Korea could be deemed to have acknowledged and adopted the relevant malicious operations as its own (Article 11 of the Articles on State Responsibility). There is no doubt that the North Korean government was elated about the SPE hack. In fact, in a December 2014 statement, the North Korean National Defence Commission praised the hackers for having ‘meted out a stern punishment of justice’ and added expressly that it ‘highly estimates the righteous action taken’.87 However, for attribution under Article 11, a mere expression of a State’s verbal endorsement of conduct does not sufficeby contrast, the State must clearly indicate its intention to accept responsibility for that conduct.88 This can be done expressly, but in that regard the statement remained adamant that North Korea had nothing to do with the hack.89 In addition, the assumption of responsibility may also be inferred from the conduct of the State in question,90 particularly if it ‘deci[des] to perpetuate’ the facts on the ground. 91 For instance, if North Korea had intentionally employed its cyber capabilities to protect Chosun Expo against counter-cyber operations while the attacks were underway, this would have been a strong indicator of adoption of Chosun Expo’s conduct as North Korea’s own.92 However, nothing of the sort was reported in the affidavit in connection with any of the incidents. Therefore, it appears that the high bar of acknowledgment and adoption has not been met and, consequently, there is no direct evidence showing that the conduct underlying the relevant operations was attributable to North Korea under Article 11 either.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 13)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### North Korea's acknowledgment of cyber operations is necessary for attribution.

> “Overall, it is our view that the evidence adduced in the affidavit and otherwise available in the public domain, even if accepted at face value, does not amount to direct evidence meeting any of the relevant standards of attribution under international law. Consequently, further evidence, particularly on the relationship between Mr Park and Chosun Expo on the one hand and North Korea on the other hand, would need to be identified in order to substantiate a claim on attribution. But what standard of proof would apply to the production of such evidence and what types of evidence would a claimant State be permitted to adduce? These are the questions to which we turn in the next section.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 13)

## 3 SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS: ATTRIBUTION OF CONDUCT

### Current evidence does not meet standards for attribution against North Korea regarding Park's actions.

> “With respect to the first standard of ‘instructions’, Mr Park and his collaborators would have to have been factually subordinate to North Korea at the specific moment when the government had supposedly decided to commit the incidents in question. In addition, the hackers would had to have been ‘specifically charged’72 by North Korea to undertake the relevant cyber operationsbut no such ‘smoking gun’ appears to have materialized. By contrast, the mere fact that the hackers and the government have shared their political goals and aims73 does not suffice for the purposes of attribution under the ‘instructions’ heading.74” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 11)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### The ILC’s Articles exclude evidentiary issues from attribution rules.

> “The ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, discussed in the preceding section, have clarified the substantive rules of attribution under international law. However, the Articles expressly excluded from their scope evidentiary issues such as the degree of proof required to establish attribution or any other aspects of State responsibility.93 In the context of adjudication, the required level of proof is called the standard of proof.94 Although related, the notion of standard of proof is different from the burden of proof.95 The burden of proof determines which of the parties to adispute must present evidence on a certain issue before the court, whereas the standard of proof determines whether the party bearing the burden of proof has discharged its burden and thus convinced the court on that issue.96 In this section, we examine the standard of proof required in ICJ cases in order to assess the extent of flexibility accepted in proving attribution in inter-State disputes.97” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 14)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### Different international tribunals apply varying standards of proof.

> “Different international tribunals have taken different approaches to the question of standard of proof. In the area of international criminal law, the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard has been established as the required standard of proof,98 as reflected in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC): ‘In order to convict the accused, the Court must be convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.’ 99 By contrast, there is no equivalent provision in the ICJ Statute and the ICJ itself has so far refrained from laying down a clear set of rules relating to the standard of proof.100 However, the issues relating to the standard of proof before the ICJ have been addressed to some extent in the scholarly literature and it is possible to draw out some tendencies in the ICJ’s approach on that basis.101” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 14)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### Serious charges require a higher standard of proof according to ICJ judgments.

> “In the Corfu Channel judgment, with respect to a UK allegation that Albania was responsible for laying mines that later exploded and caused damage to two UK vessels, the ICJ held that ‘[a] charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here.’102 This statement implies that the gravity of a charge against a State affects the required standard of proof. Confirming this understanding, Judge Higgins noted in her separate opinion to the Oil Platforms judgment that there is a general agreement that ‘the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on’.103 Therefore, it appears that more serious charges require a higher standard of proof.104” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 14)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### In the Bosnian Genocide case, ICJ applied a stringent standard of proof.

> “This general approach seems to be supported in individual cases of the Court. Accordingly, in the Bosnian Genocide case, the ICJ noted that the allegations of genocide, as ‘charges of exceptional gravity’, had to be ‘proved by evidence that is fully conclusive’.105 In assessing questions of attribution of specific genocidal acts to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Court then applied a standard approximating the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ criterion.106 In cases concerning the use of armed force, the ICJ seems to have applied the slightly lower ‘clear and convincing evidence’ standard.107 For example, in Nicaragua, it required that the facts of the claim be supported by convincing evidence.108 By contrast, in cases relating to boundary and maritime delimitation, where the assertions made by parties do not primarily concern allegations of violation of international law, the ICJ seems to apply the ‘balance of probabilities’ or ‘preponderance of evidence’ standard, which is similar to the standard of proof adopted in civil cases in common law.109” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 15)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### Cyber operations causing less serious damage may require lower proof standards.

> “Although discussions on cyber operations have mostly tended to focus on the use of force and self-defence, in reality, cyber operations that are less grave than an unlawful use of force or an armed attack but nevertheless cause damage to the economy or other vital aspects of foreign States are likelier to occur than those that could plausibly amount to an unlawful use of force or an armed attack.110 The ‘graded’ approach to the standard of proof developed in the ICJ’s case-law111 would thus suggest that in order to establish responsibility for operations causing damage but not amounting to unlawful use of force, a standard lower than ‘clear and convincing evidence’ would be used. However, going one notch lower would mean applying the ‘preponderance of evidence’ standard, which would thus equate cyber interferences below the threshold of use of force with matters of border delimitation which do not primarily concern allegations of violation of international law. In our view, neither of the possibly applicable standards is without its difficulties in cases such as this one. As noted by Roscini, endorsing the ‘preponderance of evidence’ standard in the cyber context risks inviting specious claims and intentionally false attribution.112 By contrast, the ‘clear and convincing evidence’ standard may be too stringent given that, as seen so well in the Park case, the potentially responsible State’s refusal to cooperate may frustrate much of the evidence gathering by the injured State.113 At present, the law in this regard is unsettled and it will have to develop on a case-by-case basis.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 15)

### Cooperation is essential for evidence gathering in ICJ proceedings.

> “The unwillingness of one of the parties to cooperate poses particular difficulties in the proceedings before the ICJ. Unlike a domestic court or even the ICC, whose States Parties are obliged to cooperate with the ICC under Articles 86, 87 and other provisions of the Rome Statute,114 the ICJ is in a much weaker position when it comes to compelling the parties to provide it with relevant evidence.115 Article 49 of the ICJ Statute reads: ‘The Court may, even before the hearing begins, call upon the agents to produce any document or to supply any explanations. Formal note shall be taken of any refusal.’ This ‘cautious wording’ suggests that parties are under no legal obligation to comply with the Court’s requests made under that provision.116 However, the ICJ has held that the parties have a general duty to cooperate in the provision of evidence relevant to the resolution of the dispute before it.117” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 16)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### Indirect and circumstantial evidence can be crucial in proving state responsibility.

> “The Court has on occasion permitted reliance on indirect and circumstantial evidence. In this respect, the Corfu Channel case judgment held that ‘[b]y reason of this exclusive [territorial] control, the other State, the victim of a breach of international law, is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility. Such a State should be allowed a more liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence.’ 118 The Court has later extended the applicability of this principle to all cases in which ‘the Respondent may be in a better position to establish certain facts’.119 This would normally be the case in the cyber context, where it is often impossible to ascertain the actual factual situation without the assistance of the potentially responsible State.120 Indirect and circumstantial evidence is to be accorded ‘special weight’ when it is based on a series of facts which are linked together and which lead logically to a single conclusion.121” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 16)

## 4 EVIDENTIARY MATTERS: STANDARD OF PROOF AND INDIRECT EVIDENCE

### Similarities in evidence could yield probative value for cyber operations attribution.

> “Therefore, in our view, the similarities between the various cyber operations and evidence on the use of IP addresses and e-mail accounts could be accorded some probative value if they fulfil these criteria. In this regard, it is interesting to revisit the evidence discussed earlier in this article.122 As noted, the evidence available taken individually is insufficient for the purposes of establishing attribution of the relevant cyber operations to North Korea. However, if the present case was litigated before a tribunal such as the ICJ and the respondent State would not discharge its general duty to cooperate with the Court, it is conceivable that the judges would be more inclined to make further inferences from the evidence taken collectively.123” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 16)

## 5 PROCEDURAL CENTRALIZATION: PROPOSALS OF ATTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

### An independent analysis of cyber operation evidence is necessary for stronger attribution.

> “In the light of the limited availability of evidence attributing cyber operations to a State, an independent third-party analysis of the available evidence would be desirable to strengthen its probative value. With respect to the FBI’s affidavit in the Park case, the FBI Cyber Behavioral Analysis Centre (CBAC) seems to have played an important role.124 Analysis by such private security researchers as Symantec, BAE Systems and Kaspersky has also been frequently quoted.125 However, today there is no independent specialized international entity, which would provide impartial analysis of evidence on cyber attribution. In this section, we highlight three possible models that may be considered in this regard.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 17)

## 5 PROCEDURAL CENTRALIZATION: PROPOSALS OF ATTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

### The UN Security Council could establish investigative bodies for cyber operations.

> “Firstly, the UN Security Council may establish, on an ad hoc basis, investigative bodies for cyber operations as part of its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.126 With respect to the situation in North Korea, in 2009 the Council mandated a Panel of Experts with the gathering, examination, and analysis of information regarding the implementation of sanctions against North Korea.127 The Panel has recently documented several cyber operations that had been attributed to North Korea by third States, including those allegedly conducted by Mr Park.128 In its present structure, the Panel does not conduct independent investigation and it has to rely on the information provided to it by the States. For example, although it requested information concerning the Park case from China, it then simply reproduced the received response that ‘China has not found any company registered as Chosun Expo Joint Venture, and currently does not have information regarding Park Jin Hyok’.129 Nonetheless, it is conceivable that some member of the Council will in the future propose to extend the mandate and resources of this Panel to engage in cyber attribution or to create other similar bodies to do so.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 17)

## 5 PROCEDURAL CENTRALIZATION: PROPOSALS OF ATTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

### The OPCW's models for attributing chemical weapons use may inspire cyber operation attribution mechanisms.

> “Secondly, recent developments in the context of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) provide some inspiration for the purposes of attribution of cyber operations. In 2013, in order to strengthen the OPCW’s mandate in the inspection of chemical weapons in Syria, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 2118 deciding that Syria shall cooperate fully with the OPCW and UN.130 In 2014, the OPCW’s Director-General established a Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) ‘to establish facts surrounding allegations of use of chlorine in the Syrian Arab Republic’.131 In 2015, the UN Security Council’s resolution 2235 provided the legal basis for the establishment of an OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism, which was specifically mandated to identify the users of chemical weapons in Syria.132 After its mandate expired in 2017, the UK and other States proposed a resolution of the Conference of the States Parties (CSP) mandating the OPCW to establish an arrangement for the attribution of the use of chemical weapons in Syria and it was adopted on 27 June 2018.133 This resolution is now being implemented by the OPCW and the Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) has been carrying out its investigations.134 It is not yet clear if this mechanism will prove successful and effective, but it is interesting to see such a mechanism established by a two-thirds majority vote in a CSP within the framework of a multilateral treaty. This decision was made possible because the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) provides for decision-making by a two-thirds majority of the present and voting CSP members135 and because the CWC subjects the State Parties to a general obligation to cooperate with the OPCW.136 By contrast, there is at present no treaty framework relative to cyber operations, which could be used to set up an analogical attribution mechanism in the cyberspace context.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 18)

## 5 PROCEDURAL CENTRALIZATION: PROPOSALS OF ATTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

### private partnership could serve as an effective framework for international attribution of cyber operations.

> “Thirdly, a further possible solution is to ground an international attribution mechanism on a public-private partnership between States and industry. The earliest proposal in this regard was made in 2016 by Microsoft, which suggested the creation of an organization consisting of experts from governments, industry, academia, and civil society.137 Since then, several other proposals of international attribution mechanisms have also been made, but Microsoft’s attribution organization probably remains the most prominent one among them.138 According to the original proposal, this organization’s peer-reviewed outputs would provide a technical analysis of major hostile cyber operations and, where appropriate, evidence of attribution to States.139 In a later policy paper, Microsoft clarified that although the organization would work with government experts, ‘governments would have no power to veto a final report’.140 It remains to be seen what comes out of this initiative. Among the hurdles that it would have to overcome is ensuring that the technical competence needed to determine the origin of hostile operations would be complemented with the sufficient legal competence needed to assign responsibility under international law.141” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 19)

## 5 PROCEDURAL CENTRALIZATION: PROPOSALS OF ATTRIBUTION MECHANISMS

### There is a growing demand for an independent organization for attributing hostile cyber operations.

> “Overall, it appears reasonably clear that there is a growing appetite for the establishment of some independent organization for the attribution of hostile cyber operations.142 In the long run, an institution of this kind may facilitate the process of assigning responsibility for such operations on the international plane. Until then, States will have to make do with the current decentralized, ‘messy and unsystematic’ system of accountability.143 One final aspect of this system is the legal responsibility of States for acts emanating from their territories or from infrastructure under their control—also known as the principle of due diligence—to which we turn in the next section.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 19)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### The principle of due diligence may hold states accountable under international law.

> “This section considers the principle of due diligence as a possible alternative pathway to responsibility under international law. The ICJ confirmed the existence of the principle of due diligence in its judgment in the Corfu Channel case.144 The essence of this principle is that every State must ensure that spaces under its jurisdiction are not used in ways detrimental to other States.145 However, it is a matter of some controversy whether the principle of due diligence reflects a binding obligation applicable to cyber operations.146 This is reflected in the ambiguity with which the UN-mandated Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) referred to the principle in their most recent consensus report in 2015.147” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 19)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### The GGE report's ambiguous language questions the binding nature of due diligence for cyber operations.

> “On the one hand, the report contained a phrase that ‘States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for international wrongful acts using ICTs’148—thus replicating, almost wordfor-word, the relevant dictum of the Corfu Channel ruling.149 The report also specified that if the critical national infrastructure of one State is subject to malicious cyber operations emanating from another State and if the latter receives an appropriate request, it is expected to take appropriate measures to mitigate those acts.150 On the other hand, the chapeau of the relevant paragraph expressly stated that the cited sentences were merely ‘recommendations for consideration by States for voluntary, non-binding norms, rules or principles’.151 Moreover, the use of the word ‘should’ in those sentences (as opposed to, for instance, ‘must’152) seems to indicate the weakness of the obligation.153 As such, it is clear that the GGE report does not provide unambiguous authority for the binding nature of the principle of due diligence in the cyber context.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 20)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### Tallinn Manual 2.0 establishes a stronger obligation for states to exercise due diligence in cyber operations.

> “By contrast, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 expressly provided that, as a matter of lex lata, every State ‘must exercise due diligence in not allowing its territory, or territory or cyber infrastructure under its governmental control, to be used for cyber operations that affect the rights of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’ 154 As a corollary of that rule, the Manual considered States to be obliged ‘to take all measures that are feasible in the circumstances to put an end to cyber operations that affect a right of, and produce serious adverse consequences for, other States.’155” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 20)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### A state may breach due diligence obligations based on specific criteria in the context of cyber operations.

> “According to the Manual, a State would be in breach of its due diligence obligation with respect to malicious cyber operations such as those in the Park affidavit if the following cumulative elements are met: (1) The existence of an act or a series of acts affecting the rights of a victim State;156 (2) these acts are conducted from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State;157 (3) they would have been unlawful if conducted by the potentially responsible State;158 (4) they have serious adverse consequences for the victim State;159 (5) the potentially responsible State has actual or constructive knowledge of the acts;160 and (6) the potentially responsible State fails to take feasible measures in response.161” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 20)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### Evidence suggests North Korea could be held accountable for failing to mitigate malicious cyber operations.

> “While the available facts are not conclusive, the evidence adduced in the affidavit gives some grounds for the construction of a claim for a violation of due diligence in accordance with the Tallinn Manual approach. In particular, the affidavit alleged that the relevant malicious cyber operations were launched from the cyber infrastructure located in the territory of North Korea162 (condition 2). The affidavit further referred to the extensive monitoring of internet activities emanating from North Korea,163 which strongly suggests that the government knew or must have known about the operations164 (condition 5). Given the apparent absence of any measures in response, it would be fair to conclude that the government also failed to undertake its best efforts to terminate the operations165 (condition 6).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 21)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### The conditions for due diligence breach could also apply, but require further legal evaluation.

> “As for the three remaining conditions, the effect on the rights of the victim States as well as the putative unlawfulness of the operations (conditions 1 and 3, respectively) both relate to matters of primary law, which fall outside of the scope of this article.166 Nonetheless, we are of the view that, assuming that cyber operations below the threshold of prohibited use of force or intervention may violate some rule of international law,167 these two conditions could well be met, too. Finally, it might also be questioned whether the malicious cyber operations in question resulted in ‘serious adverse consequences’ (condition 4). After all, even the Tallinn Manual experts admitted that the exact contours of this criterion, borrowed from international environmental law,168 are unsettled in international law.169 Of the incidents referred to in the affidavit, the one that arguably comes the closest to meeting the criterion is WannaCry, which allegedly affected over 1,000 pieces of diagnostic equipment in the UK and necessitated the cancellation of thousands of patient appointments.170 This is because prompt and efficient patient care is a critical government service, the denial of which would likely be perceived by States as a serious adverse consequence.171” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 21)

## 6 ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY: DUE DILIGENCE

### Due diligence could serve as a pathway to international responsibility, but needs further legal clarification.

> “In sum, where all of the applicable conditions are met, due diligence may provide an alternative pathway to international responsibility—or, in other words, a ‘palliative to the attribution problem’.172 However, the precise legal framework of cyber due diligence in international law remains in need of further clarification and development.173” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 21)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### The Park case highlights the ongoing challenges of international cyber operations.

> “Despite the undeniable effort that went into the preparation of the case against Mr Park, it is exceedingly unlikely that he will ever be tried in person on American soil.174 By contrast, we can be virtually certain that incidents such as those with which he has been charged will continue to plague inter-State relations in the foreseeable future. It is therefore useful to summarize the lessons learned from the Park case for the attribution of cyber operations in international law.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 21)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Attribution of malicious cyber operations is technically feasible with proper resources and cooperation.

> “To begin with, the evidence adduced against Mr Park confirms that the technical side of attribution might be non-trivial, but it is not impossible. The difficulties include the availability of human and technical resources as well as the need for effective international cooperation. Yet, provided that these obstacles can be overcome, the Park case indicates that at least some States now have the capacity to uncover the origin of specific malicious cyber operations and identify their authors (section 2).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 22)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Legal frameworks for attributing cyber operations to States are still inadequate.

> “While dramatic progress has been made with respect to technical attribution in cyberspace, the same has not happened with respect to the legal attribution to States. The international law of attribution, as reflected in the 2001 Articles on State Responsibility, appears too stringent for the attribution of cyber operations to States. Analysis of the evidence contained in the affidavit against Mr Park strengthens this impression (section 3).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 22)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Procedural ambiguities hinder legal accountability for cyber operations.

> “Despite the undeniable effort that went into the preparation of the case against Mr Park, it is exceedingly unlikely that he will ever be tried in person on American soil.174 By contrast, we can be virtually certain that incidents such as those with which he has been charged will continue to plague inter-State relations in the foreseeable future. It is therefore useful to summarize the lessons learned from the Park case for the attribution of cyber operations in international law.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 21)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Establishing an independent body for cyber attribution could improve evidence credibility.

> “The apparent stringency of the substantive standards is exacerbated by the lack of clarity of the applicable international procedural law. Even if a case was brought before one of the international tribunals, the relevant rules concerning the applicable standard of proof and the admissibility of indirect or circumstantial evidence are unsettled and ambiguous. However, the jurisprudence of the ICJ indicates that indirect and circumstantial evidence can be relied upon if direct evidence is not available due to the lack of cooperation from the territorial State and the required standard of proof can be lowered in the cases of lesser gravity (section 4).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 22)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Exploring alternative principles of responsibility may address gaps in cyber law.

> “To facilitate the collection of credible evidence the establishment of an independent international body that would be tasked with the attribution of malicious cyber operations would be useful. Several such attribution mechanisms have been proposed recently and it is clear the appetite for an institution of this kind is growing. However, for now the decentralized system based on an omnium gatherum of private and public stakeholders, each conducting their own attribution assessment, is likely to persist (section 5).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 22)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### Clarifying international laws regarding cyber operations is essential for state accountability.

> “Another solution is to look, so to speak, outside of the attribution box and consider other pathways to responsibility. In the international law context, this could be achieved by reference to the principle of due diligence. As Mr Park’s case demonstrates, the available evidence might suffice, except for the unsettled issues on the threshold for the application of the due diligence principle, to meet some of the conditions for a claim that a State has violated its international legal obligations by failing to take feasible measures in order to stop or at least mitigate malicious cyber operations with adverse effects on other States (section 6).” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 22)

## 7 CONCLUSIONS

### UN processes offer opportunities to advance international law on cyber operation attribution.

> “Overall, the challenges of attribution of cyber operations discussed in this article confirm the need, expressed time and again in the literature, for States to clarify their views on the interpretation of the existing international law to cyber issues.175 A few States have already done so;176 others should follow, as well. An excellent opportunity to drive the development of the law in this area presents in the two UN-mandated processes that commenced their work in 2019: the renewed UN GGE and a newly established Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG).177 In addition to soliciting the relevant opinio juris from the participating States, these groups should discuss how to facilitate the attribution of cyber operations in general, including the possible establishment of an international attribution mechanism. In doing so, they can contribute further to addressing the attribution problem, and thus to making cyberspace a more stable and secure domain.” (Mikanagi e Macak, 2020, p. 23)
