## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### The author proposes a new conceptualization of cyber attribution.

> “I propose a new conceptualization of cyber attribution to provide a reference point for debate about the means and ends of attribution, appropriate evidentiary standards for attribution claim types, and the advisability of various proposals for encouraging more and better attribution.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Cyber attribution claims are purposeful and serve specific goals.

> “When an actor makes a claim about cyber attribution, it is typically a purposeful act conducted with one or more goals in mind: aiding defensive efforts, supporting initiatives to punish or deter perpetrators, contributing to scholarly understanding of threats, attracting acclaim for infosec research adeptness, and so on. Cyber attribution claims are instrumental in nature. The optimal form and content of an attribution claim, therefore, depend on the intended goals served by the claim.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Various conceptions of cyber attribution reflect biases and differing evidentiary standards.

> “Amid calls for more cyber attribution, criticisms that governments do not do it enough, various proposals for new organizations to step in to fill the perceived gap, and a recent effort by the U.S. intelligence community to clarify its methodology for attribution, I attempt to bring greater coherence and clarity to scholarly and policy debate about attribution by identifying and defining different iterations of the concept. Though the various uses and conceptions of cyber attribution arguably have more in common with each other than not, they also reflect subtle but important biases about the means and ends of attribution as well as different evidentiary standards, target audiences, and modes of communication for attribution claims.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 2)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Analytic and strategic attribution are two overarching categories defined in the article.

> “In this article, I propose two overarching categories of attribution: analytic and strategic. I describe analytic attribution as primarily an analytic judgment pertaining to what an analyst knows (or thinks he or she knows) about the identity of a malicious cyberactor. Strategic attribution, in contrast, pertains to what the analyst does with the analytic attribution, which includes keeping the judgment private, disclosing it to selected third parties, or making it public. These three modes of strategic attribution are referred to as private, selective, and public. Judgments about analytic attribution will often rely on forensic and other technical artifacts, along with all-source intelligence about threat actors and their intentions, tools, techniques, and procedures; it amounts to a falsifiable claim about who perpetrated an attack. Decisions about strategic attribution are guided by political and economic factors pertaining to which mode of strategic attribution most advances the decision maker’s interests. These categories are applicable to attribution decisions by both state and nonstate actors.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Categorizing attribution provides a common reference for debate and evidentiary standards.

> “My contention and objective are that parsing the concept of attribution into these broad categories can provide a common reference point for 1. scholarly and policy debate about the means and ends of cyber attribution 2. appropriate evidence standards for different types of attribution claims 3. the advisability of various proposals for encouraging more and better attribution.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Fictional examples illustrate attribution decisions made by various actors.

> “I elaborate on these three categories by using a series of iterative, fictional examples involving attribution decisions by two nation-states, Americious and Ukaria; a company that suffers a breach, Acme Widget Corporation; and a cybersecurity services provider, CyberDefenders. These fictional examples are composite sketches inspired by or based on real-world incidents and activities.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Deconstructing Cyber Attribution: A Proposed Framework and Lexicon

### Fictional examples are chosen to emphasize key dimensions of attribution decisions.

> “Fictional examples are used rather than nonfictional ones for two reasons: 1) to encourage the reader to accept the presentation of the examples as given and focus critical energies on the discussion that follows them and 2) for present purposes, a trio of compact fictional examples designed to draw out key dimensions of attribution decisions is a more efficient use of limited space. Even so, these examples highlight some (but not all) of the many factors that shape analytic and strategic attribution decisions. I end by drawing out several additional conclusions.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Attribution involves determining an attacker's identity and carries normative implications.

> “At its most basic, attribution is the act of “determining the identity or location of an attacker or an attacker’s intermediary.”1 This simple definition is appealing, but it does not capture the normative and communicative connotations of the term that create implied expectations about its meaning in debates on cyber policy. In everyday (noncyber) usage, to attribute is oftentimes to assign credit or blame, as in a work or quip attributed to this or that author or a malign act carried out by a thus-guilty party. The word is laden with judgment, and, especially when it involves assigning blame, it begs the question of what consequences ought to follow. As Rid and Buchanan assert, “[d]oing attribution well is at the core of virtually all forms of coercion and deterrence, international and domestic.”2 The term also has a communicative aspect: to attribute is to name, and a name is generally not something kept strictly privateotherwise, what is the point of naming?” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### The varying uses of attribution in cyber-policy discussions reflect its complexity.

> “From this perspective, the varying usages and treatments of the word in infosec and cyber-policy debates are not surprising.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Four communities are central to making cyber-attribution claims.

> “Consider four distinct but important communities involved in making cyber-attribution claims: 1. private infosec researchers 2. private infosec practitioners 3. intelligence agencies 4. law-enforcement agencies.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Private infosec actors focus on identifying patterns in cyber threats.

> “For private infosec researchers and practitioners, attribution is often principally concerned with uncovering and identifying patterns in the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by malicious actors to aid infosec and perhaps demonstrate technical prowess for marketing purposes, bragging rights, or both.3” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Cyber attribution research includes both technical and non-technical data.

> “The grist for this research typically includes a combination of technical data acquired via analysis of the digital threat landscape and forensic investigation of cyberincidents, along with nontechnical data, such as victim identity and geopolitical circumstances.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Intelligence agencies rely on diverse data for accurate attribution.

> “Intelligence agencies also draw on technical and other data for their attribution judgments, including classified raw and analytic intelligence reporting about threat actor capabilities and intentions, to develop attribution-related products for their customers in policy and operational roles.4” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Law enforcement agencies use attribution data for prosecuting cybercriminals.

> “Law-enforcement agencies utilize these and other data to investigate suspected cybercriminals, indict them before a grand jury, and prosecute them in a criminal proceeding involving judge and possibly jury.5” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Different actors have distinct standards and goals for attribution.

> “All four actors draw on technical and other data to arrive at judgments about the perpetrator of an incident. Yet the evidentiary standards, estimative language for presenting attribution claims, target consumers, and ultimate aims of attribution are obviously quite different. These problems have prompted proposals for new institutions to carry out attribution as part of a standardized process.6,7 Attribution claims, moreover, can take varying levels of abstraction about the malicious actor’s identity and can range from the relatively specific (“Unit 61398 of the 3PLA” or “Evgeniy Bogachev”) to the relatively generic (“three computers in China”). The appropriate level of abstraction for an attribution claim depends on the goals served by making the attribution.8 If the goal is a criminal conviction, for example, attribution at the level of “three computers in China” may not suffice. Additionally, some infosec practitioners dismiss the value of communicating their attribution judgments to customers.9” (Grotto, 2020, p. 3)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Policy debates frame attribution as a strategic geopolitical intervention.

> “In policy debates, cyber attribution is often shorthand for the act of publicly accusing an actor as the perpetrator of malicious cyberactivity. In this context, attribution is a strategic intervention with geopolitically significant implications.2,10 This view of attribution emphasizes states as the author and object of attribution: “attribution is what states make of it,” according to Rid and Buchanan.2 Those authors go on to emphasize the importance of public attribution by states, which, in their view, means “improved credibility, improved attribution, and improved defences.” This is certainly true in some cases, as they persuasively argue, but not in all cases. The concept of strategic attribution, with its different subtypes—private, selective, and public—provides a framework for why this is so.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)

## Cyber Attribution in Scholarly and Policy Debate

### Attribution scholarship often emphasizes state signaling and its implications.

> “An orientation toward states and statecraft is also understandably the focus of attribution-related scholarship by international relations researchers,2,11 especially an intriguing line of research on the dynamics of states signaling to each other and other constituencies in secret.12,13 This research suggests that important, consequential signaling among state and nonstate actors can happen selectively, away from full public view. An actor’s ability to punish, compel, or deter an adversary does not necessarily require loud, public actions. What matters instead is whether a signal is intelligible and credible to the recipients. This important point, which I draw out in the discussion to follow, is seldom acknowledged in cybersecurity scholarship.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution

### The section defines key dimensions of attribution, including analytic and strategic types.

> “In this section, five concepts are given with the goal of defining key dimensions of attribution: analytic attribution and strategic attribution, along with three types of strategic attribution: private, selective, and public attribution. As can be seen, there is some fluidity between the two categories, not least because strategic attribution, by definition, requires analytic attribution. Moreover, the quality of analytic attribution may benefit from strategic attribution, when strategic attribution results in analysts sharing and acquiring knowledge that enriches the accuracy of analytic attribution. Additionally, the actors and organizations involved in decisions about analytic and strategic attribution will often overlap, though in many contexts the management and methodological models for analytic and strategic attribution will be quite distinct.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Analytic attribution involves an entity's judgment about cyber incident perpetrators.

> “Analytic attribution is an entity’s judgment about the identity of the perpetrators of a malicious cyberincident, whether the entity was the victim of the incident or not. It is primarily an analytic judgment, formed on the basis of information about the incident and its suspected perpetrators and enablers and any other relevant data. Such information may include public and nonpublic information from any source.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Examples illustrate various scenarios of analytic attribution from different entities.

> “Consider the following examples of analytic attribution: ■ Example A1: Americious is a rule-of-law-oriented Western democracy in the Anglo-American tradition. Ukaria, a fledgling democracy allied with Americious, has an unresolved border dispute with Rosaria, a longtime adversary of Americious. The lead intelligence service in Americious disseminates a classified intelligence assessment to Americious policy makers that the actors behind a cyberattack against Ukaria’s electric grid are likely affiliated with a Rosaria military intelligence unit. The assessment is based on foreign intelligence collection and forensic data brought back to Americious by a “fly-in team” of Americious government experts invited by Ukaria to support its forensic analysis of the attack. The Americious government has analytically attributed the attack to Rosaria. ■ Example B1: The Americious company Acme Widget Corporation, a publicly traded company, suffers a cyber-enabled theft of its trade secrets. Acme’s executive team assesses that malicious cyberactors located in the territory of Chicoria and acting on behalf of National Champion Company (NCC), a state-owned enterprise in Chicoria, were likely behind the incident. The assessment is based on forensic data from the company’s chief information security officer (CISO) and outside cybersecurity vendor and, critically, the timing of the incident, which coincided with its negotiations with NCC over a joint venture in Chicoria. Acme has analytically attributed the attack to NCC. ■ Example C1: CyberDefenders Corporation, a leading provider of managed security services and incident response services, assesses that a campaign of malicious cyberactivity against global shipping interests, some of whom are its clients, is likely the work of a global organized crime syndicate called #APT. CyberDefenders’s assessment is based primarily on consensual forensic analysis of its customers’ systems, with supplemental data drawn from its proprietary global sensor network (much of which is composed of consensual instrumentation of its customers’ systems) and other sources of information. In addition, by exploiting weaknesses in #APT tradecraft, CyberDefenders is able to link several suspected #APT operators to their true names with high confidence. CyberDefenders has analytically attributed the attack to #APT and several specific #APT operators.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 4)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Protagonists retain private analytic attributions while utilizing diverse data sources.

> “In these examples, each protagonist has formulated a judgment about analytic attribution. For now, at least, all have kept their analytic attributions private. They have also drawn on different data sources to arrive at their analytic attributions. In Example A1, for instance, the Americious intelligence service drew upon intelligence sources and methods, along with a trust relationship with Ukaria that permitted its experts to gain some firsthand insights into the attack. Acme’s executive team in Example B1 based its analytic judgment on information from the company’s systems and their business instincts, while CyberDefenders in Example C1 founded its assessment in substantial part on technical information from its customers’ systems.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Confidence levels in analytic judgments are influenced by the specificity of intelligence.

> “In these examples, the protagonists’ confidence level in their analytic judgments may be expressed in different ways. Assuming the Americious intelligence service’s analytic capabilities are professional, its analytic attribution of the attack against Ukaria to Rosaria would include express language about its confidence levelhigh, medium, or low. This confidence level, in turn, would be a function of how specific and direct the intelligence is. To the extent that intelligence is valuable and potentially fragile—for example, midpoint and endpoint signals-intelligence collection of perpetrator conversations and planning materials, respectively—the originators of the intelligence will have strong incentives to compartmentalize and limit the distribution of the intelligence to only those who need to know.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Analytic attribution can drive significant defensive and offensive actions.

> “Analytic attribution can provoke or inform action; it is not necessarily consequence free. Indeed, an actor’s willingness to take potentially costly actions based on an analytic attribution speaks volumes about the actor’s confidence in the accuracy of the attribution. In Example A1, Americious’s analytic attribution could lead it to take a variety of actions, such as prioritizing intelligence collection against Rosaria’s cyberoperators, pursuing covert action against Rosaria’s cyberinfrastructure, forging closer security, diplomatic, and intelligence ties with Ukaria, or building diplomatic support for norms of behavior in cyberspace during peacetime that proscribe the actions Rosaria took in Ukaria. None of these actions necessarily requires naming Rosaria’s attack on Ukaria as the inspiration for them. In Example B1, even if Acme’s evidence were limited to the executives’ hunches, the company may still decide to never do business with NCC again or even abandon the Chicorian market altogether. And in Example C1, CyberDefenders’s analytic attribution could lead the company to invest more resources in monitoring the threat posed by #APT.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Defensive actions may proceed without knowing the adversary's identity.

> “By the same token, some defensive actions do not require analytic attribution. For example, a defender does not necessarily need to know the identity of an adversary to implement known technical defensive measures. As one leading cybersecurity company asserts, “there is little to no value in true attribution (state, agency, or operator identity) to defense teams.”9 On the other hand, it is not categorically true that an analytic attribution is never valuable for defensive purposes. For instance, learning the identity of an adversary can help defenders set mitigation priorities and more effectively assess risk. As can be seen later in this article, in Example A2, Americious hopes to send this signal to grid operators by selectively attributing the attack in Ukaria to Rosaria.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Knowledge of adversary patterns assists in proactive defensive strategies.

> “Another example helps illustrate the point. Let us say that Rosaria has a propensity for launching denial-ofservice attacks against Americious banks whenever news breaks that the Americious government is considering economic sanctions against Rosaria. Knowing that Rosaria does this should alert defenders of the need to monitor the news for stories on new sanctions against Rosaria so they can be ready to surge defensive resources as necessary (or better yet, work with the Americious government on a mechanism for appropriate rapid notice).” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Analytic attribution relies on subjective assessments alongside forensic data.

> “Analytic attribution is not limited to forensic or other objective, measurable technical data. The executive team’s hunches in Example B1 formed part of the basis for Acme’s analytic attribution of NCC. The executives would presumably prefer to ground their analytic attribution on better information than what they have, but decision makers in the real world often have to make decisions based on imperfect or incomplete information. The Acme executive team’s hunch is probably not enough to persuade many third parties of NCC’s culpability, but as I will suggest, the persuasiveness of the evidence to third parties may not be a factor in terms of how a victim or other aggrieved actor responds to an incident. For some responses, all that may matter is whether the decision maker is sufficiently persuaded.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Intelligence collection is crucial for supporting analytic attribution despite technical challenges.

> “Especially for governments, intelligence collection may yield essential data pertaining to analytic attribution. Imagine if Rosaria’s operation against Ukaria was exquisite from a technical perspective and left no traces of tradecraft or tools in the aftermath of the attack. Ukaria knows it experienced a power outage and may have suspicions about who caused it and how, but, from an evidentiary standpoint, the cause might as well have been swamp gas. Under the circumstances, technical forensic analysis would yield little of probative value. But if Americious had penetrated Rosaria’s military intelligence unit and had a vetted, reliable asset there, and/or had corroborating signals intelligence, then the lack of technical forensic evidence pointing to Rosaria’s role in the attack may be irrelevant as far as analytic attribution is concerned. The attack itself may have been exquisite, but it doesn’t necessarily follow that high-confidence analytic attribution is impossible.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 5)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Collaboration among allies enhances the effectiveness of forensic analysis.

> “In any event, exquisite attacks along these lines are uncommon: hackers make mistakes or leave technical “dots” ready to be connected with other dots. Analytic attributions will often draw, at least in part, on forensic analysis of a victim’s machines and/or its infrastructure that came into contact with them. In Example C1, for instance, CyberDefenders’s analytic attribution is based in part on data collected from its enterprise customers on a consensual, contractual basis. One important practical implication of this mode of sourcing is that the corporation’s customers have a decisive say in the types of data and systems it can access—and what it can do with them.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Trust levels impact the confidence analysts have in their findings.

> “Similarly, in Example A1, the trust relationship between Americious and Ukaria paved the way for the Americious experts to conduct their forensic analysis. If the technical forensic analysis yielded decisive clues about Rosaria’s role in the attack, then Ukaria’s consent and cooperation played a major role in the ability of Americious to arrive at its analytic attribution. Depending on the nature or terms of the bilateral relationship, Ukaria may have a valid claim of collegial right to Americious’s analysis, including judgments about analytic attribution—and possibly even significant influence over what Americious does with its analytic attribution, including with which other third parties, if any, Americious can share its findings (more on this later).” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### Victim cooperation is essential for accurate assessment by third parties.

> “The confidence that Americious analysts place in their findings is going to be a function of how much they trust the intentions and integrity of Ukaria—and their own ability to detect any evidence of tampering by Ukaria. If Ukaria is a close ally with deep, enduring political, military, and intelligence ties to Americious and has a reputation for integrity, then the Americious analysts might take it as an article of faith that Ukaria would not tamper with the machines affected by the attack. On the other hand, if Americious had reason to believe that Ukaria might consider tampering with the evidence, the Americious analysts would have to discount the probative value of data pertaining to attribution if they had doubts about their ability to detect tampering.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Analytic Attribution: Who Is the Malefactor?

### The complexity of cooperation affects investigation access and outcomes.

> “The example assumes that Ukaria is able to make commitments on behalf of its electric grid operators, or at least that the grid operators and their host government have an aligned set of interests in allowing Americious analysts to participate in the investigation. The situation would get vastly more complex if, instead, the grid operators opposed allowing the Americious analysts access and Ukaria had no authority to compel them to do otherwise. A victim’s willingness to cooperate with authorities or other third parties is a critical factor in the ability of these third parties to understand what happened and possibly who did it.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Strategic Attribution: Do We Tell? And Whom?

### Strategic attribution involves disclosing analytic attribution when benefits outweigh costs.

> “Strategic attribution occurs when an entity decides to disclose its analytic attribution to a third party, based on an assessment that the benefits of disclosure outweigh the costs. Factors bearing on its assessment of benefits and costs may include business, legal, political, evidentiary, and reputational considerations, among others. An entity engages in strategic attribution if and only if it assesses that doing so will serve their interests.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Strategic Attribution: Do We Tell? And Whom?

### There are three forms of strategic attribution: private, selective, and public.

> “Strategic attribution comes in three forms: ■ private attribution, which involves deciding to not disclose an analytic attribution to third parties ■ selective attribution, in which an analytic attribution is disclosed to select third parties ■ public attribution, where an analytic attribution is made more or less public. The article focuses here on selective and public attribution, with aspects of private attribution woven in.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 6)

### The Americious government selectively attributes cyberattacks to manage threat perceptions.

> “Selective Attribution: Pssst ... Listen to This! Consider the following examples of selective attribution: ■ Example A2: The Americious government provides classified threat briefings to major Americious grid operators on the tools, techniques, and procedures that the threat actors from Rosaria used to carry out the attack in Ukaria and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the threat. In the classified briefing, the Americious government also describes its classified analytic attribution of Rosaria as the perpetrator as context to reinforce the severity of the threat and the need for the operators to prioritize these particular mitigations. The briefers also hope that the quality of the briefing, including the decision to share sensitive forensic attribution details, will persuade the operators to reciprocate and engage in information sharing with the Americious government about the threat. The Americious government has selectively attributed the attack to Rosaria, with major Americious grid operators as the recipients of the selective attribution. ■ Example B2: Acme Widget Corporation’s CISO shares information about the incident, along with the company’s analytic attribution of the incident to NCC, with a trusted circle of fellow CISOs at similarly situated companies to aid their defense and reinforce reciprocity norms about sharing threat information within the circle of trust. The CISO shared the information under a Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Red designation to highlight the sensitivity of the information. The company’s general counsel also shares information about the incident with outside counsel to facilitate the understanding of legal risks and options and notifies Americious law enforcement (ALE) of the breach. Acme has selectively attributed the attack to NCC; recipients include the CISO’s trusted circle of fellow CISOs and outside counsel. The disclosure to law enforcement is not an example of selective attribution unless Acme shared its analytic attribution as part of the disclosure. ■ Example C2: CyberDefenders issues a report on the cyberattack campaign, including its analytic attribution of the campaign to #APT, to its customers, who pay considerable sums of money for the report and sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as a condition of receipt. CyberDefenders has selectively attributed the attack to #APT. CyberDefenders chooses to not identify the true names of the suspected operators in its report, however. This choice is an example of private attribution.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

### Americious provides analytic attribution to critical infrastructure to enhance public safety.

> “In Example A2, the Americious briefers shared their analytic attribution with a subset of critical infrastructure owners and operators to protect public safety. Americious made a judgment that these companies had a need to know that warranted exposing intelligence sources and methods to some heightened degree of risk of unauthorized disclosure.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

### Selective outreach by Americious may increase risks for unbriefed industries.

> “By being so selective in its outreach to the private sector, however, Americious has potentially assumed new risks. What if Rosaria or another malicious actor was able to use substantially similar tradecraft to attack sectors that had not been briefed? Most importantly, this would put the people of Americious at risk of harm. But it could also jeopardize the political fortunes of Americious’s leadership, who, in the aftermath of such an attack, would face the inevitable second-guessing of why they had failed to brief more companies.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Strategic Attribution: Do We Tell? And Whom?:Selective Attribution Pssst ... Listen to This!

### Mutual understanding of intelligence sharing is crucial between Americious and Ukaria.

> “What does Ukaria think about Americious’s actions in Example A2, and should Americious care? Ukaria is unlikely to let a foreign government, even a friendly one, examine infrastructure that was targeted by a hostile foreign power without some guarantee that the fruits of the examination would make their way back to Ukaria. One of the issues that Americious and Ukaria (and their respective legal advisors) would want to have worked through in advance is calibrating both sides’ expectations about what is and is not shared by way of intelligence associated with the incident. Americious could share its technical findings with Ukaria but leave it up to Ukaria to connect the analytic attribution dots. Or it could go a step further and engage Ukaria in a more robust analytic exchange and dialogue that could include judgments about analytic attribution. Either way, the two parties will want to think this through in advance.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Strategic Attribution: Do We Tell? And Whom?:Selective Attribution Pssst ... Listen to This!

### Americious must signal deterrence effectively to Rosaria.

> “Intelligence is ultimately about informing action, so another issue the two parties will want to think through is arriving at a mutual understanding of what each side will do with what it learns from the other. This is a delicate issue because both sides would understandably resist restrictions on the use of information that could potentially save lives or avert catastrophic economic harm. Ukaria, for example, would almost certainly want to give its own electric grid operators a briefing similar to what Americious provided its grid operators. Americious would be hard pressed to say no, though it would obviously want to work with Ukaria to ensure that risks to intelligence sources and methods were managed appropriately.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

### Evidentiary standards in attribution may not influence effective deterrence.

> “Extending Example A2 further, Americious may want to send deterrence signals to Rosaria. It could so in a variety of ways, but what is important is that the signals are intelligible and credible to Rosaria’s leadership; otherwise, the signal would not have the desired impact. Americious could send a public signal (more on this later), but it could also send a private signal through one or more discreet channels, such as the Americious ambassador to Rosaria delivering a demarche to the Rosaria foreign minister and/or the Americious embassy chief of station communicating with the head of Rosaria’s military intelligence. The message might go something like this: “We know you did this, and if we see you preparing to do this against us, we will be forced to respond preemptively at a time and in a manner of our choosing.” This would be an example of selective attribution in service of deterrence.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

### CyberDefenders uses selective attribution for context while protecting its sources.

> “Notice how, in this particular scenario, the evidentiary standard in the underlying analytic attribution is basically irrelevant as far as deterrence goes. Whichever Rosarian official receives the message may well protest the accusation, express outrage, and demand evidence. Americious could refuse to engage, and, as long as Rosaria understood the message and assessed the threat as credible, the failure to engage should not affect Rosaria’s calculus.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

### Acme's management faces complex decisions regarding breach disclosures and strategic attribution.

> “In Example B2, Acme’s executives are trying to get their heads around what happened by seeking external advice and assistance, with the CISO also recognizing that peer infosec officers in similar companies might be facing similar risks. Example B2 also makes reference to the Acme CISO’s use of the TLP, which is widely used by infosec practitioners to label threat-related information according to its perceived sensitivity and request that recipients handle the information accordingly. TLP Red is the highest classification under this scheme; it means the material is not for disclosure and restricted only to participants.14 The kind of exchange described in this example happens all the time in the corporate infosec world, and anecdotal evidence suggests that these exchanges result in stronger defenses. On the other hand, these exchanges often occur without the knowledge or consent of the company’s senior executives. These interchanges are informal, rooted in personal bonds of trust, and done in secret.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 7)

## Deconstructing (and Reconstructing) Cyber Attribution:Strategic Attribution: Do We Tell? And Whom?:Selective Attribution Pssst ... Listen to This!

### CyberDefenders engages in selective attribution to provide context and protect interests.

> “In this case, the fact that the information is labeled TLP Red means that the individuals with whom the Acme CISO shared the information should not provide it to others within their organizations (including the senior executives) or refer to it in the context of strategic attribution without the consent of the originator, Acme’s CISO. It is important to note, however, that the TLP scheme is not binding on participants; putting a TLP classification on a document or asserting it in a conversation does not create any legal rights or duties among the parties to the exchange. Unless recipients also sign NDAs or similar agreements (as CyberDefenders required recipients of its report to do in Example C2) or a specific law is broken, Acme would have no recourse under the law to sue or press charges against a recipient who violates the terms of TLP Red sharing.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 8)

### Public attribution is a strategic choice prioritizing benefits of disclosure.

> “Public attribution is another form of strategic attribution and occurs when an entity calculates that the mode of disclosure of its private attribution to third parties that best serves its interests is public disclosure. Put differently, public attribution reflects a judgment by an entity that the benefits of public disclosure outweigh the balance of benefits and costs associated with selective or private attribution.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 8)

### Examples of public attribution show governmental and corporate responses to cyberattacks.

> “Consider the following examples of public attribution: ■ Example A3: The Americious ministers of energy, homeland security, and state issue a joint statement blaming Rosaria for the cyberattack against Ukaria. The ministers and their law-enforcement colleagues publish an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. The Ministry of Justice indicts three operators in the Rosarian military intelligence service for criminal prosecution, and the Ministries of Commerce and Treasury impose economic sanctions on the operators’ entire military unit and affiliated business interests. The Americious and Ukarian ambassadors to the United Nations request an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider an appropriate response to Rosaria’s alleged aggression. The Americious government has publicly attributed the attack to Rosaria through several channels. ■ Example B3: The Acme Widget Company files a lawsuit in Americious court against NCC, alleging theft of trade secrets and other damages in its pleading. Acme has publicly attributed the attack to NCC. ■ Example C3: CyberDefenders releases a public report on its assessment of the incident, in which it names #APT as the perpetrator. The report is careful to avoid any use or reference to information protected by CyberDefenders’s contracts with its customers. CyberDefenders has publicly attributed the attack to #APT.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### Public attribution necessitates different evidentiary standards for varied actions.

> “Example A3 features a cornucopia of public attributions aimed at imposing costs on Rosaria using a range of different modalities, each of which is subject to different requirements or expectations about evidentiary standards—no fewer than four such standards, in this example. Americious’s optimal end state for the criminal indictments is to secure criminal convictions for the three suspects. Here, the evidentiary standard might be something like the American standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” an appropriately high standard when the stakes involve denying persons their liberty. Conviction requires, of course, that ALE is able to bring the three suspects into custody—Americious does not try criminal defendants in absentia—and to presumably do so without the cooperation of Rosaria, which is unlikely to turn over its own operatives to stand trial in a foreign land. Getting custody of the suspects may be tricky, however, if the suspects are savvy about international travel and extradition processes. Americious might have to settle instead for having the suspects live under the shadow of the indictments, which is no trivial thing to the extent the suspects had aspirations of being internationally mobile. The evidentiary standard for indictments compared to criminal convictions is lower in Americious, as is typical, and is similar to the American standard of whether there is probable cause (i.e., reasonable grounds) to believe the suspects committed a crime. The evidentiary standard for economic sanctions may be even lower.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### International evidentiary standards for cyber attribution lack consistency.

> “Persuading a jury to deliver a guilty verdict in a criminal case is no small feat, from an evidentiary perspective. Persuading foreign governments that an analytic attribution is true, as Americious and Ukaria will have to do to build a multilateral coalition against Rosaria’s actions, presents its own unique challenges, for several reasons. There are no consensus evidentiary standards under international law generally for assigning blame, let alone in the cyber context specifically. For example, a U.N. Group of Governmental Experts concluded in 2015 that accusations of malicious cyberactions should be “substantiated,” but there was no consensus on what it would take to substantiate an accusation.15 In addition, unlike criminal proceedings in most rule-of-law democracies, where evidentiary rules exist to safeguard the integrity of evidence, there are no such rules in international affairs. Indeed, Americious based its analytic attribution in part on classified intelligence collection, which is often stolen information” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### The credibility of the claimant affects the persuasiveness of evidence in attribution.

> “Moreover, the persuasiveness of the evidence in international affairs when there is no smoking gun is closely tied to the credibility and reputation of the claimant. This feature of international politics was illustrated perhaps most famously when Secretary of State Dean Acheson, on behalf of President John F. Kennedy, visited French President Charles de Gaulle to show him surveillance photos of Soviet missiles in Cuba. De Gaulle reportedly declined to view them and told Acheson that “The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me.” If Americious has a strong reputation for honesty, good faith, and integrity, its implied evidentiary burden at the United Nations is almost certainly lower than for countries lacking that reputation.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### Public attribution generates domestic pressure for action against cyber aggressors.

> “As it stands today, the evidentiary standard for public attribution outside the confines of established legal or other adjudicatory frameworks is context dependent and fundamentally political. The identity of the claimant bears directly on the credibility of its claim, with none of the formal evidentiary and other substantive and procedural safeguards available in most municipal legal settings to protect the integrity of evidence and witness testimony with the goal of allowing the facts and evidence to speak for themselves. Similarly, nation-states and other actors will often evaluate evidence with an eye toward what the consequences might be if the evidence were true. They are not neutral factfinders.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### Civil litigation requires high evidentiary standards for cyber damage claims.

> “The example notes that Americious ministers published an alert on the technical aspects of the threat, with recommended mitigations. Even though the point of the alert seems to be to equip defenders with threat information and practical mitigations as opposed to making the case for Rosaria’s culpability, the ministers should expect skeptics and naysayers to cite any perceived evidentiary inadequacies in the alert as part of an effort to undermine the credibility of Americious’s accusations against Rosaria.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 9)

### Public reports by cybersecurity firms serve strategic interests but pose risks.

> “Regardless of what other governments think about these claims, Americious and, especially, Ukaria have set in motion with their public attribution a strategic dynamic with domestic political and geopolitical implications. If the two countries fail to marshal international support for some form of meaningful punitive action against Rosaria, Rosaria and other countries might conclude that the diplomatic costs of offensive cyberoperations are manageable. For Ukaria in particular, by making a strong statement of public attribution about an attack it suffered, it will almost certainly face some pressure at home to “do something” about Rosaria, independent of what happens at the Security Council. Americious might face similar pressures at home as well. A government’s inability to meet these expectations is a cost and must be factored in to a calculus about public attribution.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Selective attribution is more common but often overlooked in cybersecurity analysis.

> “In Example B3, Acme seeks money damages from NCC. To prevail against NCC in a civil lawsuit with American-like evidentiary requirements, Acme will have to persuade a factfinder (a judge or jury) that the preponderance of the evidence (i.e., at least 50.0000001%) supports their claim, meeting the standard of “more likely than not.” There is a potential cost to this lawsuit, beyond the inevitable lawyers’ fees. If Chicoria, NCC’s home government, is vindictive, then, by waging the lawsuit, Acme may be effectively writing off the Chicorian market.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Victims' preferences heavily impact the attribution process.

> “In Example C3, why would CyberDefenders issue a public report? Maybe its executive leadership is legitimately fed up with #APT and wants to provoke media and policy makers to pay more attention to it. A public report may also be good for sustaining employee morale by giving analysts and others in the company a sense of mission and importance. And last but not least, a compelling report is killer marketing.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Victims of cyber incidents significantly influence the attribution process.

> “On the other hand, a public report is going to get picked apart by other researchers. There is no consensus over appropriate evidentiary standards for analytic attribution by a private company in the court of infosec opinion, so CyberDefenders is exposing itself to a potentially fluid and shifting set of evidentiary expectations. Also, depending on the antagonist featured in the report, the report could expose the company to reprisals from an angry government or, in this example, a criminal group. The stakes are high for CyberDefenders. It is a reminder that an actor does not engage in strategic attribution unless the benefits outweigh the costs. As one cybersecurity company aptly explains its policy on attribution, “Due to the lack of value to defenders and the ramifications of incorrect attribution, Dragos does not comment publicly on attribution.”9” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Victims of cyber incidents influence the attribution process and strategic objectives.

> “Several conclusions emerge from this discussion. Analytic attribution—a theory of who perpetrated a cyberattack—is sometimes necessary for action but not always. And even in cases where having some theory of analytic attribution is a prerequisite for action, the necessary level of specificity about the identity of the perpetrator to enable action can vary widely. For infosec researchers and defenders, distilling information about malicious activity into broad adversary groupings“APT 1,” “Fancy Bear,” and the like—is often sufficient to enable research and defensive efforts that require some measure of analytic attribution. For such actions as criminal prosecutions, economic sanctions, and civil lawsuits, however, a specific person or organization must be identified. Even so, the evidentiary standards for each of these actions are different and range from relatively low (sanctions) to substantial (criminal conviction) to informal and community driven (adversary groupings).” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Selective attribution is often overlooked yet plays a critical role in cyber policy.

> “Selective attribution is far more common than public attribution yet its vital role in infosec and cyber policy is often glossed over. Evidentiary issues may be partly to blame for the relative lack of scholarly and policy attention paid to selective attribution since these more discreet acts of attribution, by definition, do not always register in the public domain. That said, it is clearly a topic worthy of more scholarly and policy focus. Strategic attribution will often be necessary for sending deterrence signals, but the sender has a choice between delivering the signal selectively or publicly. Which mode is superior is likely to be context dependent, and there is nothing inherently superior about public attribution: sometimes it may be necessary; other times it will not be.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)

### Victims' consent and cooperation are crucial in determining attribution outcomes.

> “Finally, the victim of a cyberincident will often have a decisive say in attribution matters. If the individual or entity’s consent and cooperation are required before a third party is able to investigate an incident and acquire data leading to an analytic attribution, or they have a veto right over how a third party can use the data it acquired, including for strategic attribution, then the third party’s options for attribution are linked to the victim’s preferences. In some cases, the victim’s preference for discretion may conflict with a third party’s desire to use the incident to advance some strategic objective, such as deterrence. The reverse may also be true.” (Grotto, 2020, p. 10)
