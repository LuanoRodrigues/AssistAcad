# <h1>The Law and Politics of Cyberattack Attribution</h1>

## Introduction

### Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is essential for accountability and legal consequences.

> “Figuring out who’s doing what to whom and publicly identifying those responsible for bad acts in cyberspace are key elements of increasing efforts to hold those actors more accountable. Cyberattack attribution is the process of assigning responsibility for carrying out a cyberattack.1 Accurate attribution of cyberattacks is a crucial predicate to a wide range of related or responsive actions; in particular, attribution to a state can set in motion different legal consequences. Criminal indictments are one example: in the United States, a criminal charge of economic espionage requires the involvement of a foreign government.2 Another is insurance coverage.3 Invoking coverage exclusions for cyberwar, insurance companies have denied claims made by companies that suffered hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in a cyberattack called NotPetya, which the United States and its allies have attributed to the Russian military.4 Still other important examples involve cyberbased responses, ranging from taking foreign government-linked cyber infrastructure offline5 to even forcible self defense in response to an armed attack.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)

## Introduction

### Cyberattack attribution encompasses complex technical, legal, and political dimensions.

> “Cyberattack attribution has technical, legal, and political aspects.6 The technical side of attribution—identifying the source of a cyberattack at the machine or internet protocol address level—has improved substantially over the last few years. But attributing cyberattacks to individual perpetrators and especially to states that direct the attacks remains complicated because it involves unsettled legal and political issues. Questions about who should accuse governments of cyberattacks and when and how to make such accusations remain highly contested. These questions are becoming more urgent as the need for accurate attribution of cyberattacks spreads to more contexts.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 523)

## Introduction

### Legal discussion on cyberattack attribution has lagged behind the evolving cyber landscape.

> “Now, nearly a decade after Stuxnet targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges,7 scholars and states have devoted significant attention to how the primary rules of international law should govern state behavior in cyberspace.8 But legal issues surrounding attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks have received comparatively little attention.9 A major reason for this differential treatment may be the status of the relevant non–cyberspecific international law. On questions about the primary rules of international law, such as what counts as an armed attack and how to apply the principle of proportionality, international law is well-settled and can be applied, with some modifications, to cyberattacks.10 Attributing responsibility for cyberattacks to states, on the other hand, intersects with secondary international law rules regarding the evidence states must provide when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts—an area of law that is notoriously underdeveloped even outside the cybersecurity context.11 This results in a double challenge for those deciding how much and what kind of evidence to disclose to support a cyberattack attribution: simply borrowing lex generalis from the noncyberspace context is hard to do, and lex specialis governing evidence for cyberattack attribution has not yet crystallized.12 At the same time, the lack of existing standards presents an opportunity. Setting clear evidentiary standards for states to follow in the cyberattack attribution context could help to clarify evidentiary standards in international law more generally and to regularize the cyberattack attributions made by nongovernmental actors as well.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 525)

## Introduction

### The gap in legal standards for cyberattack attribution presents both challenges and opportunities.

> “As both cyberattacks and cyberattack attributions increase in frequency,13 it is important to understand who attributes, how, and why, and to examine which answers to those questions will best further the goals that attribution is intended to serve. Attributors may intend attributions to deter states from further attacks, deter individual hackers within states, enable better network defenses, or serve as a prerequisite to responsive actions. Done carefully and transparently, public attributions can also further the broader goals of promoting stability and avoiding conflict in and over cyberspace.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 525)

## Introduction

### Understanding the intent behind cyberattack attributions is crucial for their effectiveness.

> “This Article provides the first comprehensive account of states’ emerging practice of issuing coordinated cyberattack attributions and explores three themes regarding how cyberattacks are attributed to states.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 525)

## Introduction

### This article offers a comprehensive overview of coordinated cyberattack attributions by states.

> “First is the interrelationship between law and politics. Although the United States, United Kingdom, and most recently France and the Netherlands have asserted that publicly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks is a political decision, not a legal one, the issue is more complicated. The decision to attribute publicly is partly political: a state could suffer a cyberattack, obtain extensive evidence identifying the perpetrator, and still say nothing publicly. But when a state chooses to make a public attribution to another state, it should substantiate the accusation, and in doing so, international law has a role to play. Evidentiary issues have legal underpinnings, and the U.S., British, French, and Dutch efforts to block the development of customary international law on attribution are shortsighted.14 Although existing international law does not set clear evidentiary requirements for how to make attributions, establishing an international law standard would have significant benefits in the cybersecurity context. And setting lex specialis for cyberattack attribution could spur clarification of other evidentiary standards in international law.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526)

## Introduction

### Political considerations significantly impact the decision to publicly attribute cyberattacks.

> “The second and related theme is the relationship between domestic and international law. If attributions are to be governed by law, the applicable law could be either domestic or international. Currently, domestic law, particularly in the United States, is doing some of the work to fill gaps in standards left by underdeveloped international law.15 But although domestic law is a helpful stopgap, it will be insufficient in the longer term, making the development of international law on attributions increasingly important.16 In some cases, where attribution mechanisms governed by domestic law—such as indictments and economic sanctions—are used to accuse governments of cyberattacks, international law may require states to meet a standard higher than the domestic law floor of probable cause or substantial evidence required to satisfy constitutional due process.17” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 526)

## Introduction

### The interplay between domestic and international law is pivotal in the context of cyberattack attribution.

> “The third and final theme relates to issues of institutional design.18 To date, governments, companies, academic institutes, and nonprofits have all attributed cyberattacks to state-sponsored actors. Despite some recent examples of coordinated attributions, the current attribution “system,” such as it is, is messy and decentralized. Going forward, the optimal structure for attribution of cyberattacks should be the one that best furthers the purpose or purposes attribution is intended to serve: deterring future bad acts, enabling defense, laying the foundation for responsive actions, and promoting stability and avoiding conflict.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)

## Introduction

### Institutional design issues affect the effectiveness of current cyberattack attribution practices.

> “The Article proceeds in three parts. Part I first provides an overview of the practice of governmental and nongovernmental parties in publicly attributing cyberattacks to states and then evaluates the purposes public attributions may serve. Part II turns to the law of attribution. After examining the underdeveloped state of existing international law on evidentiary standards for attribution both in general and in the cyberattack context, the Article argues for the importance of developing international law on evidentiary standards to govern cyberattack attribution in particular. Specifically, the Article proposes that international law should require governments that engage in public attributions of cyberattacks to other states to provide enough evidence to enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions. Part III turns to issues of institutional design. Companies and think tanks have made several proposals for an international entity to handle attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks. Although these proposals have much to recommend them, the Article argues that such an entity should supplement, not replace, the current decentralized system of attribution. Having a multiplicity of attributors—both governmental and nongovernmental—yields a greater likelihood that public attributions will serve the defensive and deterrent purposes attributors aim to achieve. And having an evidentiary standard to govern attributions, as this Article proposes, creates an alternative to centralization for ensuring that attributions are credible.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### Attribution in cybersecurity identifies responsible entities for cyberattacks.

> ““Attribution” has multiple meanings relevant to cybersecurity. At the most general level, “attribution” refers to identifying the entity responsible for a cyberattack or intrusion. But what is meant by the responsible entity can vary. Scholars often speak in terms of three types of answers: the machine from which an attack was launched, the individual sitting behind the machine and carrying out an attack, and the individual or entity that directed the attack.19” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 527)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### Attribution types are conceptually distinct yet often interrelated in practice.

> “As Herb Lin has explained, “these three types of attribution are conceptually distinct,” but “often related in practice.”20 In particular, “[k]nowing the machine from which the intrusion initially emanated may provide some clues that can help uncover the identity of the perpetrator, and knowing the perpetrator may provide some clues that can help identify the specific adversary that should be held ultimately responsible” for the intrusion.21” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 528)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### Different types of attribution present various challenges and technical considerations.

> “Nonetheless, the different types of attribution pose different sorts of challenges. Identifying the machine from which an attack was launched is largely a technical question.22 When malicious activity is discovered, investigators consider indicators of compromise, such as internet protocol addresses, domain names, hashes of programs running on compromised computers, and styles of attack used in the intrusion.23 The infrastructure and software used in an attack can also provide clues because hackers often reuse the same infrastructure and code in different attacks.24 Other information, like the hackers’ apparent work schedules, use of words in a particular language, or language settings on computers used to write malware, can yield circumstantial evidence about the hackers’ identity,25 but at the same time, it can be faked relatively easily in a false flag operation—a deliberate attempt by hackers to disguise their identity.26” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 528)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### Political and legal implications arise when attributing cyberattacks to state actors.

> “Moving beyond technical attribution to a machine, identifying the entity that directed or masterminded the attack implicates political and legal considerations. When the entity that directs a cyberattack is a state, the international law on state responsibility governs the extent to which a state can be held legally responsible, and it defines “attribution” as “the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State.”27” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 529)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### Improvements in technical attribution capabilities contrast with unresolved political and legal issues.

> “While technical attribution capabilities have improved dramatically in recent years, the political and legal issues surrounding ultimate attribution to state actors remain unsettled and contested. Subparts I.A and I.B track the evolution of attribution practice of states and nongovernmental parties respectively, emphasizing both shifts in the capacities for technical attribution and emerging policy and legal positions. Subpart I.C then identifies several purposes that attribution can serve.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 529)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution

### The focus of attribution discussions includes major nations and entities involved in public attributions.

> “The following Subparts focus heavily, but not exclusively, on the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as on U.S. companies and a Canadian research institute. This focus reflects the entities that have engaged in public attributions to date or publicly addressed the legal issues surrounding attribution. Other entities’ views are discussed to the more limited extent they are publicly available. These include governments, like Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand, that have participated in coordinated attributions, as well as countries like China and Russia, which have been on the receiving end of public attributions and have also communicated some views about evidence and attribution in multilateral fora. If this Article’s prescriptions are taken up by governmental and nongovernmental attributors, then a greater diversity of views may become publicly available going forward.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 529)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### The practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks is a recent phenomenon.

> “The practice of states publicly attributing cyberattacks to other states is a recent phenomenon.28 The first public accusation by the U.S. government came in 2014, when the United States accused five members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of hacking U.S. companies to steal intellectual property.29 Attributions were almost exclusively a U.S. phenomenon until 2017,30 when state-to-state attributions increased significantly.31” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 530)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Technological advancements have improved the capability for public attribution of cyberattacks.

> “The move to publicly attribute cyberattacks to governments first required improvements in the technical capacity for attribution.32 In a 2010 Foreign Affairs article, then Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn signaled the difficulty of attributing cyberattacks, writing that “[t]he forensic work necessary to identify an attacker may take months, if identification is possible at all.”33 Scholars at the time echoed the idea that attribution was difficult, if not impossible.34 But U.S. officials soon began to signal that the U.S. government had significantly improved its attribution capabilities. In a 2012 speech, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained that over the prior two years, the Defense Department had “made significant advances” in attributing cyberattacks.35 He warned, “[p]otential aggressors should be aware that the United States has the capacity to locate them and to hold them accountable for their actions.”36 In 2015, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper told Congress that most hackers “can no longer assume that their activities will remain undetected. Nor can they assume that if detected, they will be able to conceal their identities. Governmental and private sector security professionals have made significant advances in detecting and attributing cyber intrusions.”37 In September 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) characterized cyberattack attribution as “difficult but not impossible.”38” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 531)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### A cat-and-mouse dynamic complicates the cyberattack attribution process.

> “The advances in technical attribution may be matched over time by advances in attackers’ ability to mask their identities, creating a cycle of escalating offensive and defensive capabilities in which the two sides will alternate having the advantage.39 This cat-and-mouse game will continue to make attributions challenging, but at the same time, hackers, like their targets, are fallible and often make mistakes that reveal their identity. Indeed, the U.S. ODNI notes that “[a]lmost all cyber attribution successes have resulted from discovery and exploitation of the attackers’ operational security errors.”40” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 532)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### The U.S. employs various methods for public attribution of cyberattacks.

> “The United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years.41 Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 532)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Criminal indictments have been used for public attribution of cyberattacks.

> “The U.S. Department of Justice handles criminal indictments. The first public attribution by the U.S. government came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China’s PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal intellectual property.42 As has become routine in attributions-by-indictment, the fifty-six-page indictment alleges violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,43 including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, and computer damage.44 The indictment also includes charges of economic espionage and trade secret theft, which are typical in cases involving theft of intellectual property.45 Other indictments have followed. For example, in 2017, a federal grand jury indicted two Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers for directing a hack that compromised 500 million Yahoo accounts.46 And in early 2020, a federal grand jury indicted four members of China’s PLA for the 2017 hack of consumer credit reporting agency Equifax—a breach that compromised the personal information of 145 million U.S. victims.47” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 533)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Economic sanctions are a mechanism for public attribution of cyberattacks.

> “The second mechanism the United States has used for attributions is imposition of economic sanctions. These attributions-by-sanctions fall under the purview of the Treasury Department. Executive Order 13,694, issued in 2015, created a new cyber sanctions regime allowing the Treasury Secretary to block the property of individuals “engaging in significant malicious cyberenabled activities,” including interference with critical infrastructure computers and complicity in significant cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets.48 In December 2016, the Obama Administration amended the Executive Order to include election interference.49 The Administration promptly used the new authority to sanction—and thereby accuse—Russia’s intelligence services, four Russian intelligence officers, and three companies for interfering in the 2016 election.50 Attributions-by-sanctions are accompanied by a Treasury Department press release that makes explicit the allegation of foreign government involvement in or responsibility for a cyberattack. For example, the press release detailing sanctions imposed on North Korea for the 2014 Sony Pictures hack explained that the sanctions were “[i]n response to [North Korea’s] numerous provocations, particularly the recent cyberattack targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment and the threats against movie theaters and moviegoers.”51” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 535)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Technical alerts from DHS are utilized for attributing cyberattacks.

> “The third mechanism the U.S. government uses for attributions is technical alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.52 The alerts provide technical information, such as indicators of compromise and malware descriptions, to help system administrators defend against malicious activity.53 Attribution-by-alert occurs when a technical alert includes an allegation that the threat actor behind malicious activity is a foreign government. For example, in June 2017, DHS issued an alert about “a malware variant, known as DeltaCharlie, used to manage North Korea’s distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet infrastructure.”54 The alert “provides technical details on the tools and infrastructure used by cyber actors of the North Korean government to target the media, aerospace, financial, and critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and globally.”55 Similar attributions-by-alert have included, for example, accusations of North Korean government responsibility for malware that enabled fraudulent withdrawals from automated teller machines in dozens of countries.56 Others have accused Russia of targeting the energy sector and collecting information on industrial control systems.57” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 535)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Public statements and press releases are employed for attributing cyberattacks.

> “The final mechanism the U.S. government has used for attributions to foreign governments is the issuance of public statements or press releases. For example, in the wake of the Sony hack, the FBI issued a statement attributing the cyberattack to the North Korean government.58 Similarly, DHS and the DNI issued a statement attributing the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Russian government.59 Often, such attributions-by-press release are the first in a series of U.S. governmental attributions and responsive actions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 536)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Multiple attribution methods may be deployed for the same cyber event.

> “The U.S government frequently deploys more than one mechanism to attribute a particular cyberattack, including rolling out different attribution methods over the course of months or even years. For the Sony hack, the U.S. government first attributed the attack to North Korea in the FBI statement,60 and followed with attribution-by-sanctions a few weeks later.61 Nearly four years later in September 2018, the United States also engaged in attributionby-indictment, unveiling criminal charges against a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, for allegedly participating in a “government-sponsored hacking team” responsible for the Sony hack, among others.62” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 536)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### The attribution of election interference follows similar patterns to prior attributions.

> “The attribution of election interference to the Russian government followed a similar pattern. The United States followed the joint DHS-DNI statement63 with sanctions several months later against the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), the Federal Security Service (FSB), and individual GRU officers.64 Then in July 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller presented and a grand jury returned an indictment charging twelve GRU officers with hacking-related offenses,65 including conspiring to hack “into the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” and conspiring to hack “state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and U.S. companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of U.S. elections.”66” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 537)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### The ordering of attribution actions can differ between cases.

> “Although the United States has used the statement-sanctions-indictment ordering in several high-profile instances, this ordering is not consistent across attributions. In accusing the Iranian government of involvement in DDoS attacks against U.S. financial institutions, for example, an indictment came first, and sanctions followed more than a year later.67” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 537)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Attribution practices increased significantly following the WannaCry attack.

> “The practice of governmental public attributions broadened significantly in late 2017 and has increased since then. The impetus for the uptick was a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry. In May 2017, WannaCry malware spread quickly, reaching “more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries” and hitting the U.K. National Health Service particularly hard.68 The ransomware encrypted data on infected machines, locking victims out of their files unless they paid $300 in Bitcoin.69 In the United Kingdom, some hospitals diverted ambulances and patients, and nearly 7000 medical appointments were cancelled.70 The attack also hit the Russian Interior Ministry and impacted companies including Spain’s Telefonica, France’s Renault, and FedEx.71 Spread via phishing emails, the ransomware reportedly “us[ed] a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons”—a method that was stolen and posted online by a group called the “Shadow Brokers.”72” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 538)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Coordinated attributions regarding WannaCry involved multiple states.

> “Shortly after the attack, press reports indicated that North Korea was responsible,73 but official attributions came only months later. Britain started the ball rolling, with a government minister telling the BBC in October 2017 that North Korea was responsible, but declining to explain the evidentiary basis of the attribution.74 Then, in mid-December, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand issued coordinated statements attributing WannaCry to North Korea and denouncing the country’s actions.75 White House Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert explained in a press briefing that the United States “do[es] not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence, and we do so with partners,” citing the support of allied countries and “[c]ommercial partners,” including Microsoft and Facebook, which “act[ed] on their own initiative . . . without any direction by the U.S. government or coordination to disrupt the activities of North Korean hackers.”76 After the public attributions, additional actions took months. In June 2018, the United States criminally charged a North Korean citizen, alleged to be a member of “a government-sponsored hacking team,” for working for “a North Korean government front company . . . to support the [North Korean] government’s malicious cyber actions,” including WannaCry.77 The Treasury Department also sanctioned him in September 2018.78 In 2019, the Treasury Department sanctioned additional North Korean entities for their involvement in WannaCry.79” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 539)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Several countries coordinated attributions of cyberattacks against the GRU.

> “Four significant coordinated attribution efforts have followed the WannaCry attributions. One focused on NotPetya—a serious disruptive cyberattack in June 2017 that struck Ukraine and spread worldwide, crippling companies, including FedEx and Maersk, and ultimately causing more than $10 billion in damages.80 NotPetya initially looked like a ransomware attack similar to WannaCry,81 but it “irreversibly encrypted computers’ master boot records,” rendering ransom payments “futile.”82 Ukraine accused Russia of responsibility in July 2017.83 Coordinated attributions followed in February 2018, with the United Kingdom taking the lead in attributing NotPetya to the Russian military.84 The United States seconded the U.K. attribution, calling WannaCry a “reckless and indiscriminate cyber-attack that will be met with international consequences,”85 and other countries, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, and New Zealand concurred.86 The United States subsequently cited Russia’s responsibility for NotPetya as among the bases for sanctioning the GRU and GRU officials.87” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 541)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### In a May 2018 speech, the U.K. Attorney General echoed the U.S. position on evidence disclosure.

> “The second major coordinated attribution occurred in October 2018, when the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States led coordinated attributions to the GRU of cyberattacks against entities investigating Russian misdeeds.88 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom accused the GRU of sending agents to the Netherlands to hack the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),89 which was investigating the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter in the United Kingdom.90 According to the Dutch government, investigation of hacking equipment seized from the GRU operatives in the Netherlands also revealed that one of the operatives had “target[ed] the investigation of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17,”91 which was shot down by a Russian missile over Ukraine in 2014, killing the nearly 300 people on board.92” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 541)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### Scholars note disagreements among states over evidentiary requirements.

> “Another facet of the attributions focused on the GRU’s targeting of antidoping agencies. The United States released an indictment accusing several GRU agents not just of targeting the OPCW, but also of hacking numerous antidoping agencies, including the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association.93 Russia allegedly targeted these organizations due to their “role in the investigation or public condemnation of Russia’s state-sponsored athlete doping program.”94 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom confirmed the doping related attributions.95 Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom further piled on by attributing the 2016 DNC hack to the GRU.96” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 542)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:A. The Practice of States

### The Tallinn Manual acknowledges the lack of consensus on evidence requirements in cyber attribution.

> “A third coordinated attribution in December 2018 garnered less attention. The U.S. Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals with a decade-long campaign of hacking at the behest of China’s Ministry of State Security,97 and allied countries simultaneously confirmed the accusations.98 The indictment alleges that the defendants directly hacked dozens of companies and government agencies to steal sensitive data,99 and starting in 2014, they also hacked “managed service providers”—companies like cloud providers that store information for other companies—and used their unauthorized access to steal intellectual property and other data from the providers’ clients.100 According to press reports, the compromised companies include Hewlett Packard Enterprises, IBM, and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which builds nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy.101 Multiple private cybersecurity firms had also identified and tracked the hackers for years,102 publishing details about the defendants and their exploits.103” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 543)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental entities also attribute cyberattacks to states.

> “Governments are not the only entities that attribute cyberattacks to states. Cybersecurity companies, technology companies, nonprofits, and an academic institute have made numerous public attributions to governments in recent years.119 As with the dominance of the U.S. government on the governmental side, most, but not all, of the nongovernmental entities that make public attributions are U.S.-based.120” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental attributions can precede governmental attributions.

> “In high profile instances, nongovernmental attributions to governments have preceded government attributions. For example, in a detailed report issued in February 2013, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant identified one of the Chinese PLA officers whom the United States later indicted for intellectual property theft.121 Similarly, in June 2016, CrowdStrike, which the DNC had hired to investigate security breaches, publicly accused the Russian government of hacking the DNC months before the U.S. government did.122” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 547)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental attributions provide more technical details than governmental ones.

> “Nongovernmental attributions differ from government attributions in a number of ways.123 First, nongovernmental attributions are often quite detailed, providing indicators of compromise and other technical information.124 The publication of such details allows others to take actions to defend networks from further breaches, as well as to verify the attribution.125” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 548)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental attributions cover a wider range of attacks compared to governmental attributions.

> “Second, nongovernmental attributions cover additional types of attacks beyond what governments have attributed. In some cases, victim governments may be reluctant to attribute hacks of the sort that they may also undertake, such as espionage against traditional governmental targets,126 but nongovernmental attributors are not so constrained. For example, the U.S. government never formally attributed the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, which involved the compromise of security clearance information for 21.5 million people.127 The closest the United States came to an attribution was a statement by then DNI James Clapper who, when asked about the hack, said, “‘You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did.’”128 CrowdStrike, on the other hand, attributed the attack to China.129” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 549)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental attributions address types of attacks that governments may avoid.

> “In other cases, nongovernmental attributors have focused on different kinds of attacks, such as hacks with human rights implications. For example, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has attributed instances of nation-state espionage against civil society. Citizen Lab has published several reports on exploits sold by NSO Group, an Israeli company, to governments around the world and then used against civil society.130 For example, Citizen Lab attributed an attempted compromise of the phone of a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to that country’s government.131 It similarly accused the Mexican government of targeting journalists and lawyers investigating government corruption and human rights abuses.132” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 549)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### Nongovernmental attributions implicate a broader array of government attackers.

> “Third and relatedly, nongovernmental attributions have implicated a broader range of government attackers. Many of the attributions focus on the same countries that governmental attributions do, namely China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.133 But others have named different governments, including Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.134” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 550)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:B. Attributions by Nongovernmental Actors

### The implications of attributions differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors.

> “Finally, the implications of making an attribution differ for governmental and nongovernmental actors. To be sure, entities on either side of the state/nonstate line could make themselves a target for retaliation by attributing a cyberattack to a state.135 But governments that accuse other governments of cyberattacks face pressure to undertake follow-up actions against the identified perpetrators.136 The difficulties of follow-on actions, such as indictments, sanctions, or covert or overt responsive actions, may discourage governments from making public attributions. Nongovernmental entities are not responsible for responsive actions and therefore may feel somewhat freer to accuse governments in the first place. Put another way, the pressure on governments to combine the naming-and-shaming of public attribution with other responses means that government attributions run a greater risk of escalation than nongovernmental attributions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 551)

### Some cybersecurity firms avoid public attributions to prevent escalations.

> “Notably, not all cybersecurity companies are willing to make public attributions to governments or think such attributions are a good idea. A company called Dragos, which focuses on industrial control system cybersecurity, has a policy against publicly attributing intrusions to governments. In a Washington Post interview, Dragos CEO Robert Lee explained, “‘[T]here’s no value to our customers’ in identifying their attackers,” and called attribution a “political discussion,” noting that “an inaccurate attribution of responsibility could escalate tensions between states.”137 Other companies, especially non-U.S. companies, have attributed state-sponsored cyber operations obliquely, without explicitly naming the state involved.138 In particular, Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, has identified malware used by the “Equation Group,” which is understood to refer to the U.S. National Security Agency and other U.S. government entities, though Kaspersky has refrained from explicitly naming the United States.139” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 551)

### Public attributions can achieve broader goals beyond private determinations of cyberattack perpetrators.

> “Very often victims or government agencies may determine who conducted a cyberattack, but decline to make that information public. They may share attributions with close allies or even communicate attribution to the perpetrator. Because such attributions are secret or at least not publicly known, however, they are of more limited utility. The public attributions that this Article addresses can serve more and broader goals.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 551)

### Public attribution serves macro-level deterrence by naming state-sponsored actors.

> “One of the most frequently cited purposes of public attributions is macro-level deterrence.140 The idea is that public naming-and-shaming of state-sponsored actors will cause the named states (and potentially other states that might be watching) to refrain from future cyberattacks. For example, in announcing an indictment of Iranian hackers for DDoS attacks on U.S. financial institutions, then FBI Director James Comey explained, “By calling out the individuals and nations who use cyber attacks to threaten American enterprise, as we have done in this indictment, we will change behavior.”141 U.S. officials made similar claims about the cyber sanctions executive order.142 The Obama Administration’s Cybersecurity Coordinator, Michael Daniel, called the sanctions regime “a new way of both deterring and imposing costs on malicious cyber actors wherever they may be.”143” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)

### Victim states can privately deter specific attackers, but public attribution is necessary for broader deterrence.

> “Victim states can attempt to deter specific perpetrators without going public, instead communicating privately to the attacker to convince or threaten the attacker into ceasing its behavior. The Obama Administration reportedly attempted such an approach with Russia in August and September 2016 in advance of publicly attributing the DNC and related hacks to Russia.144 The Washington Post has reported that U.S. Cyber Command is considering similar private warnings to Russian officials and oligarchs if Russia attempts to interfere in the 2020 election.145 Deterring states other than the perpetrator from attempting similar attacks, however, requires public attribution.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 552)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:C. The Purposes of Attribution

### Measuring the deterrent effect of cyber attributions is complex and nuanced.

> “Measuring the deterrent effect of attributions is difficult. Unlike nuclear deterrence, where effective deterrence meant zero use of nuclear weapons, effective deterrence in the cybersecurity sphere need not mean no cyberattacks, but rather no cyberattacks above a certain level, measured either in severity or frequency. Understood in this more nuanced way, the macrolevel deterrence concept has borne some fruit. After the first U.S. attributionby-indictment—the charges against Chinese PLA officers for intellectual property theft—sources indicate that the Chinese military substantially scaled down its economic espionage activities.146 But at the same time, statesponsored hacks of many kinds have continued after indictments.147 Jack Goldsmith and Robert D. Williams have bluntly declared that with respect to intellectual property theft, “the Justice Department’s deterrence-byindictment efforts have failed. And the scale of the failure is large.”148 The Justice Department’s own continued indictments bear witness to this: in December 2018, the United States released an indictment of hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of State Security for wide ranging intellectual property theft that started in 2014—the same year indictments were supposed to begin deterring such behavior.149” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 553)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:C. The Purposes of Attribution

### Public attributions may create individual-level deterrence through personal risks for indicted individuals.

> “Expecting public attributions alone to deter states may be asking too much. But public attributions serve other purposes. First, public attributions to particular individuals employed or sponsored by foreign governments may create successful micro-level deterrence. Individuals charged in an indictment cannot travel to the indicting country or to countries thathaveextraditiontreatieswith theindicting country; if they do, they risk capture and transfer for trial.150 Individuals subject to economic sanctions may have assets seized and cannot engage in financial transactions touching the United States or other sanctioning countries. These risks are real, and they are personal.151 Individual-level deterrence may therefore be more effective than macro-level deterrence,152 though its efficacy may vary by country. For example, losing the ability to travel to or store money in Western Europe may be less of a blow to North Korean hackers than to Russians.153 The efficacy of individual punishments for government-backed hackers may also depend on the extent of coercion to which the hackers are subject in their home country. If their actions on behalf of their government are not voluntary, then the hackers will not alter their behavior in response to a threat of prosecution or sanctions by a foreign government.154 Nonetheless, the indictments and sanctions may help to create workforce problems for at least some governments as individuals with the skills to engage in state-sponsored hacking consider other career options.155” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 555)

### Public attributions enable deterrence-by-denial by strengthening defenses against cyberattacks.

> “Another purpose public attributions serve is enabling so-called deterrence-by-denial—strengthening defenses to prevent attempted attacks from succeeding and thus convincing attackers that attacking is not worth the effort.156 Attribution can bolster deterrence-by-denial by enabling those responsible for network defense to better secure their systems.157 This mechanism is particularly likely to work when the public attribution is accompanied by technical details that enable defensive actions. For example, a recent technical alert from DHS “contain[ed] indicators of compromise . . . and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures . . . used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks” and specifically noted that the alert aimed “to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.”158 Public attribution to a government is not necessary to enable such defenses, but it can be helpful.159 Understanding who the attacker is can shed light on intruders’ likely targets and goals. For example, a state is more likely to be interested in information with strategic and national security value—items less likely to be of interest to run-of-the-mill cybercriminals seeking financial profit.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)

### Public attribution justifies responsive actions in international law contexts.

> “A third purpose of public attribution is justifying responsive action. This is perhaps obvious with respect to indictments and sanctions, which both identify specific objects of the charges or sanctions. It is, however, equally true of other responsive actions. As a matter of international law, a state that has suffered an internationally wrongful act may take countermeasuresactions that would be unlawful but for the prior unlawful act.160 But an injured state may only take countermeasures against the state responsible for the internationally wrongful act, necessitating that the victim state identify the state responsible.161 Such an attribution could be done privately,162 but if so, the victim state would risk other states viewing its countermeasure as an initial wrongful act, rather than a lawful response. Thus, public attribution helps to ensure that other states, commentators, and the public more generally understand the tit-for-tat of states’ actions and which states believe their actions are legally justified countermeasures.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)

### Public attributions supported by evidence can promote stability and understanding in cyberspace.

> “Finally, and somewhat relatedly, public attributions that are supported by evidence can help to promote stability in and avoid conflict over cyberspace. There is currently a lack of clarity about what states are actually doing in cyberspace.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 556)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:C. The Purposes of Attribution

### Clarity in state actions is enhanced through attribution, aiding public awareness of cyber incidents.

> “Such lack of clarity about states’ actions is not unique to cyberattacks,163 but it is exacerbated in the cybersecurity context because some cyberattacks do not cause observable real-world effects, state cyber capabilities are often classified, and even when attacks are observable, their technical aspects create barriers to public understanding. In some cases, the attribution of a cyberattack may provide the only indication to parties other than the victim that anything has happened and what exactly has occurred.164” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 557)

### Public evidence fosters agreement about state actions and improves attribution accuracy.

> “Publicly providing evidence about state behavior can help not just to provide greater information about states’ actions, but also to foster agreement about the factual reality of what states are doing. Public disclosure of evidence allows for crosschecking or corroboration of attributions by both governmental and nongovernmental actors, ensuring or potentially improving the accuracy of attributions.165” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 557)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:C. The Purposes of Attribution

### Agreement on facts facilitates the development of customary international law and norms.

> “Development of international law, particularly customary international law, proceeds through states’ application of law to facts. The common understanding about factual reality that can come from public attributions enables states to undertake the process of applying principles to facts that leads to the creation of primary rules to govern state behavior—rules in the form either of norms or, more robustly, as customary international law.166 As Martha Finnemore and Duncan Hollis have explained, attributions “serv[e] as an opening bid” and can “lay out the contours of ‘bad behavior’ along with an argument about why, exactly, the behavior is undesirable”—an argument that other actors can then accept, reject, or accept in part.167 Public attributions foster “interactions between the accuser, the accused, and third party audiences that—over time—may result in the creation of a new norm.”168 Translated into the language of customary international law: [P]ublic attributions may serve as early evidence of a “usage”—that is, a habitual practice followed without any sense of legal obligation. If such accusations persist and spread over time, States may come to assume that these accusations are evidence of opinio juris, delineating which acts are either appropriate or wrongful as a matter of international law.169
To be sure, this process will not be quick or easy, but agreement on facts can help to shift disagreements into the realm of norms and law, and away from questions about simply who did what to whom.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 558)

## I. The Practice and Purposes of Attribution:C. The Purposes of Attribution

### Understanding facts is valuable for states to navigate international behavior and avoid escalation.

> “Even absent or in advance of agreement on norms or law, there is value in having agreement on facts. States with divergent views about the permissible bounds of state behavior can nonetheless benefit from understanding how other states believe that norms or law apply to facts. Understanding the factual scenarios that other states will, for example, consider to constitute a violation of international norms or international law enables states to tailor their actions to avoid what another state would perceive to be escalatory behavior.170 In this way, public attributions promote stability in the international system as a whole. The purposes that attributors intend public attributions to serve can vary. And different purposes may require different levels of evidence, as discussed in the next Part.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 558)

## II. The Law of Attribution

### The current legal framework for cyberattack attribution is fragmented and needs international legalization for stability.

> “Assuming that the technical side of cyberattack attribution is a surmountable challenge, the legal and policy aspects of attribution raise a number of questions. This Part addresses the extent to which attribution is currently governed by law and how international and domestic law interact. Although existing laws are somewhat unsettled and fragmentary, this Part argues that greater legalization of attribution at the international level will promote the goals that attribution is intended to achieve, particularly fostering stability in the international system.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 559)

### International law lacks clarity on standards of proof for state accusations of wrongful acts.

> “International law is unclear on the standard of proof that states must meet when accusing other states of internationally wrongful acts.171 The law is most developed with respect to the high end of state action, namely, the evidence a state needs to provide to justify forcible self defense in response to a claimed armed attack. But even there, the law is unsettled.172 For lesser internationally wrongful acts, international law remains very murky.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 559)

### Some support exists for a 'clear and convincing' evidence standard for self defense claims.

> “Some support exists for the idea that a state seeking to use force in self defense must provide “clear and convincing” evidence that it has suffered an armed attack. The “clear and convincing” standard derives from suggestions in International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinions, as well as from state practice.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 559)

## II. The Law of Attribution:A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General

### ICJ holds the burden of proof lies with the accusing state, but the required standard remains unclear.

> “Although the ICJ has held that the state claiming to act in self defense bears the burden of proving that an armed attack occurred,173 it has not explicitly determined the standard of proof that such a state must meet.174 In the 2003 Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Iran v. United States), Judge Rosalyn Higgins criticized the ICJ’s lack of clarity on standards of evidence.175 She noted that “in a case in which so very much turns on evidence, it was to be expected that the Court would clearly have stated the standard of evidence that was necessary for a party to have discharged its burden of proof,” but “neither here nor elsewhere does the Court explain the standard of proof to be met.”176 She critiqued the Court’s prior opinions in Corfu Channel and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua as similarly unclear,177 noting that in Nicaragua, “the Court did not even attempt to articulate the standard of proof it relied on, merely holding from time to time that it found there was ‘insufficient’ evidence to establish various points.”178 Higgins noted that “[b]eyond a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on, there is . . . little to help parties . . . as to what is likely to satisfy the Court.”179” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 560)

### The ICJ established that exceptional gravity claims demand conclusive evidence.

> “The ICJ addressed the standard of proof more explicitly in the 2007 Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention & Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), which dealt with state responsibility for genocide.180 The Court explained that “claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive.”181 In yet another formulation, the Court explained that it must be “fully convinced” that genocide has occurred and that “[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts.”182 Although the Genocide Convention case did not address self defense in particular, its evidentiary standard appears more broadly applicable, adjusting based on the gravity of the offense claimed.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 561)

### Scholars imply a 'clear and convincing' standard for self defense in ICJ case law.

> “While acknowledging and criticizing the ICJ’s failure to resolve the standard of proof required in use of force cases, scholars have argued that the ICJ’s case law supports an implied clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard for self defense.183 Such a standard is less than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard employed in criminal law, and more than a preponderance of the evidence.184 In essence, a “clear and convincing” standard requires “the party with the burden of proof . . . [to] convince the arbiter in question that it is substantially more likely than not that the factual claims that have been made are true.”185” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 561)

## II. The Law of Attribution:A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General

### State practice, especially U.S. practices, supports a 'clear and convincing' evidence standard.

> “Scholars draw further support for the clear and convincing evidence standard from state practice, particularly U.S. practice.186 Scholars have collected numerous examples of U.S. officials citing “‘convincing’ or “‘compelling’ evidence” to support forcible responses to terrorist attacks, including bombings of Libya in 1986, Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 1993, and Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998.187 Perhaps most significantly, the United States appears to have deployed the clear and convincing standard to justify the use of force in self defense after the 9/11 attacks.188 In a letter to the President of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations explained that the United States had “clear and compelling information” that Al Qaeda “had a central role in the attacks.”189 The “clear and compelling” phrasing similarly appeared in a statement by the NATO Secretary General confirming that NATO considered the 9/11 attacks to trigger NATO’s collective defense provisions.190 It is not clear, however, that the United States and NATO—to say nothing of states outside that blocregard the provision of clear and convincing evidence to be a matter of legal obligation. That is, while there is some state practice to support a clear and convincing evidence standard, it is unclear whether there is opinio juris as required for customary international law.191” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 562)

## II. The Law of Attribution:A. International Law on Evidence-Giving and Attribution in General

### The evidentiary standards for lower-level actions remain ambiguous under international law.

> “While the ICJ and state practice lend some clarity to the evidentiary standard for uses of force, the standard for lower level actions is even less clear. The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility the most authoritative treatment of state responsibility and, relatedly, countermeasures—does not address evidentiary issues. The Articles explicitly set aside evidentiary questions, noting in the commentary that “[q]uestions of evidence and proof of such a breach [of an international obligation] fall entirely outside the scope of the articles.”192 For its part, the ICJ has only suggested that evidentiary standards vary along a sliding scale based on the severity of the offense.193 If the most serious international offenses, such as armed attacks and genocide, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence,194 then presumably the standard for lesser wrongs is lower. But how much lower?” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 563)

### State practice in cybersecurity provides little clarity on evidentiary standards.

> “State practice in the cybersecurity context provides little additional clarity. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have made statements about the evidence question. The United States has taken the position that in the absence of explicit international law on the standard of proof, “international law generally requires that States act reasonably under the circumstances.”195 The United Kingdom has said only that “the victim state must be confident in its attribution of that act to a hostile state before it takes action in response.”196” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 563)

### Variation in evidence provided by states affects clarity in cyberattack attribution standards.

> “Turning from what states say to what they do, the practice of state cyberattack attributions described in Part I could lend additional clarity to the evidentiary standard. However, there has been significant variation in the amount of evidence states adduce when attributing cyberattacks. When the United States first attributed the Sony attack to North Korea, it released very limited evidence, contained in its entirety in an FBI press release.197 Some states appeared to accept the attribution, issuing statements that denounced North Korea’s actions.198 But some in the cybersecurity community publicly doubted the attribution,199 criticizing the U.S. government for providing limited and questionable evidence of North Korea’s involvement.200 In response, the FBI released slightly more detailed evidence, citing operational errors by the hackers that revealed their use of internet protocol addresses used solely by North Korea.201” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 564)

### Detailed attributions enhance clarity in evidence for cyberattack cases.

> “Other attributions have included more details. Attributions-by-indictment in particular have been quite detailed, as have attributions-by-alert.202 The WannaCry attributions, initially done through official statements,203 were less detailed, but a subsequent indictment provided additional information.204 Among the most detailed attributions to date are those to the GRU in October 2018. There, the Dutch investigation produced significant evidence due to the physical presence of the Russian government operatives in the Netherlands,205 and the U.S. indictment provided considerable detail, particularly with respect to the targeting of worldwide antidoping organizations.206” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 564)

### Emerging state practices suggest a requirement for evidence in cyberattack attributions.

> “As a matter of customary international law, looking to state practice among the states that make public attributions of cyberattacks might suggest an emerging requirement to give at least some evidence.207 However, the U.S., British, Dutch, and French statements about attribution and evidentiary standards seem precisely designed to block the development of customary international law by denying the existence of one of the two requirements for custom. Customary international law requires both “general and consistent” state practice and opinio juris—that the state practice is undertaken out of a “sense of legal obligation.”208 These states have explicitly claimed that international law does not require a state to reveal the evidence on which an attribution is based.209 Deeming the decision to release evidence a mere “policy choice”210 ensures that the states’ recent practice of giving at least some evidence to support attributions cannot be cited as having been done out of a sense of legal obligation.211 In short, although their actions might begin to demonstrate consistent state practice, their words deny the existence of the opinio juris required for customary international law.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 565)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution

### Cyberattack attribution must be governed by law rather than policy.

> “Attribution should be governed by law, not treated merely as a matter of policy. To be sure, the decision of whether to make an attribution public is partly a political one—a victim state need not announce that it has been attacked or identify the perpetrator.212 But when states do publicly attribute cyberattacks, how such attributions occur should not be left to policy. The next two Subparts explain why law, not just policy, should govern the evidentiary standard for public attribution of cyberattacks and propose a customary international law standard for the amount of evidence states should provide.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 566)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### International law does not currently mandate evidence for cyberattack attribution.

> “At least for cyberattacks that do not rise to the level of an armed attack, the U.S., U.K., French, and Dutch position that international law does not currently require evidence-giving appears to be correct. But that merely raises the question of whether international law should have such a requirement.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 566)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### Evidence-giving has significant implications for the reliability of state attributions.

> “Given that the United States and other Western countries now often give some evidence to support public attributions, the question of whether to establish a legal standard to require such evidence-giving may seem superfluous. However, the reason states provide evidence—whether as a policy choice or to fulfill a legal requirement—has significant consequences.213 Characterizing a practice as merely a matter of policy means that it can be changed at any time by the states that currently provide evidence, and other states that might begin to make public attributions could totally disregard it. Practices undertaken as a matter of legal requirement, on the other hand, are stickier. For states that recognize the legal obligation, changing practice would require a change in legal position that may be difficult or impossible to square with their past legal views.214 And invoking a legal obligation to provide evidence also constitutes a normative claim about the appropriate behavior of other states.215 States are under no obligation to agree with or abide by one another’s policy choices, but customary international law is a different matter. Once established, it binds all states, even those that did not specifically consent to its formation.216” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 567)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### Relegating evidence to policy risks legitimizing unsubstantiated attributions.

> “Relegating evidence-giving to the policy category risks legitimizing future evidence-free attributions. Such “trust us” attributions are problematic for any number of reasons. They may be false. They will be difficult to corroborate (or debunk) because of the lack of supporting evidence. They may foster greater consolidation of blocs with respect to internet governance and cybersecurity issues because “trust us” will only work with allies.217 And they may skew the development of primary norms of state behavior.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 567)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### False attributions can corrupt the formation of customary international law.

> “To understand how such skewing could occur, consider the following hypothetical: The power grid in a major State A city goes down. State A quickly and without providing evidence attributes the outage to a cyberattack by State B. Although the accusation is false, State A then uses the attribution—which State B cannot refute because of the lack of evidence to debunk—to claim that power grids are legitimate targets for cyberattacks. State A might use this (false) claim of state practice to justify attacking power grids itself or, for example, in a multilateral negotiation at the United Nations about the bounds of permissible state behavior in cyberspace. In other words, having a false and yet not falsifiable claim of state behavior may corrupt assessments of state practice that form the basis of norms and customary international law. This risk is particularly acute where, as in the cyberspace context, the primary norms are not yet well-established. Of course, establishing an evidentiary standard may not stop states from making false accusations. But a state’s failure to comply with the established evidentiary standard should make other states reluctant to count the unsubstantiated claim in assessments of state practice. The evidentiary standard, therefore, can help to insulate the process of primary norm creation from inaccurate or deliberately false claims about state behavior. In the context of the hypothetical, the evidentiary standard would prevent State A’s attempt to establish a permissive rule allowing targeting of power grids based on State B’s practice because State A’s claim about State B’s practice would not be credited.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 568)

### Perpetrator states benefit from requiring evidence for accusations against them.

> “From a purely self-interested perspective, perpetrator states should see value in requiring accusers to support their accusations.218 This category includes the United States, which is an active player in cyberspace, and as such, is likely to be on the receiving end of attributions going forward.219 States that are active in cyberspace can be accused of all manner of activity for which they are not responsible, and could have difficulty refuting such accusations because of the lack of supporting evidence to discredit. The requirement to provide evidence to support accusations acts as a deterrent to untruthful or ill-founded accusations.220” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 568)

### The reluctance of certain states to legalize evidentiary standards is unexplained.

> “Given these downsides, why then would the United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom resist legalizing the evidentiary standard for attribution? These states have not explained their reasoning in detail. The most likely explanations do not withstand scrutiny, however, and other incentives should counsel in favor of developing a legal standard.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 569)

### Concerns about protecting intelligence sources justify limited public attribution.

> “First, governments often invoke the need to protect intelligence sources and methods. The United States in particular appeared concerned on this score when it initially attributed the Sony hack to North Korea with little public evidence.221 Concern about sources and methods is undoubtedly legitimate, and the need to preserve sources and methods may mean that in some cases, states will not make attributions public. At the same time, however, the detailed attributions that the United States has made show that in many cases, it is possible to develop evidence without disclosing classified information, or while disclosing only enough information that the benefits of the attribution outweigh the costs of disclosure. The detailed evidence in the nongovernmental attributions further shows that government sources and methods are not necessarily required for attributions. Drawing on nongovernmental information and attributions may provide governments with an alternative to revealing their own classified sources and methods.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 569)

### States fear that legal requirements may increase their evidentiary burdens.

> “Second, states may fear that a legal requirement to provide evidence would require more evidence than they currently provide as a matter of policy. But the best way to ensure that does not come to pass is to use their first-mover advantage to stake out a claim about what the legal standard should be.222 If states that currently make public attributions fail to take the lead and use the attributions to set the evidentiary standard, they run the risk of having a legal standard set for them. The standard could be set by other states that get into the attribution business and announce evidentiary standards or successfully advocate for such standards in international fora.223 Or the standard could be set indirectly by nongovernmental attributors in a sort of “cyber CSI effect.”224 Pursuant to the so-called “CSI effect,” the portrayal of high-tech investigations in shows like CSI has allegedly caused jurors in real-life criminal trials to have unreasonable expectations about the kinds and amount of evidence prosecutors can produce.225 Nongovernmental attribution reports could have a similar effect: the nongovernmental parties’ practice of publishing detailed evidence to support their attributions of cyberattacks to governments may shape public and states’ expectations about the type and amount of evidence that governments should supply when making similar accusations. Nonstate practice cannot, of course, directly create customary international law,226 but nongovernmental practice can shape expectations about evidence that, as a practical matter, states may be forced to meet if they wish their attributions to be believed. By foregoing the opportunity to set a legal standard through their attribution practice, the United States and its allies risk having a higher standard set for them as a matter of norms and accepted practice.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)

> “Third, with respect to other cybersecurity related issues, treaties or other agreements on state behavior have been hampered by problems of verification. The United States, among others, has rejected the idea of a cybersecurity treaty to hem in state behavior because of the inability to verify other states’ compliance.227 If deviations cannot be detected reliably, then agreeing to legal rules will restrict the freedom of action of law-abiding states, while doing nothing to restrict the actions of scofflaw states. But this concern does not apply to setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving. Compliance with a legal requirement to provide evidence to support public attributions requires transparency and publicity. The standard is defined by disclosure, and so violation of the requirement is comparatively easy to monitor.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 570)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### Establishing evidentiary rules can positively impact stability in cyberspace.

> “Finally, working for the progressive development of law to require evidence to support attributions could have significant positive systemic effects, supporting stability and helping to avoid conflict over cyberspace. Evidentiary rules are secondary rules,228 but establishing evidentiary rules for attributions could help to foster the establishment of primary rules about acceptable state behavior in cyberspace—an avowed goal of the United States and its allies.229 This point may seem counterintuitive. Setting a legal requirement for evidence-giving raises the cost to states of making an attribution, which might suggest that states will make fewer public attributions. It is certainly possible that requiring evidence-giving or setting an evidentiary standard for attributions could decrease the absolute number of attributions. States and private parties may not be able to meet the evidentiary standard in some cases and so will refrain from making a public attribution that they would make absent an evidentiary standard.230” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 571)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### Clarity on evidentiary standards may enhance the benefits of making credible attributions.

> “But setting the secondary rules of evidence may also increase the benefits of making a public attribution. Clarity about the amount and nature of evidence that other states and the cybersecurity community will expect for a credible attribution changes the calculus for states considering the costs of revealing sources and methods necessary to disclose evidence. In essence, clarity about the evidentiary standard helps to ensure that states undertaking the costs of disclosure will obtain the benefit of being believed by relevant actors.231 Clarity about the evidentiary standard could change the calculus for nongovernmental attributors as well. Although nongovernmental parties are not directly bound by international law and thus wouldn’t be required to comply with the evidentiary standard, meeting the standard could lend credibility—and consistency232—to the attribution practices of companies and other nongovernmental attributors as well. Clarity about what an attributor must do to obtain the benefits of attributions may spur additional attributions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:1. Why Legalize?

### Fewer credible attributions are preferable to many erroneous ones.

> “In any event, even if setting an evidentiary standard decreases the total number of public attributions, having fewer credible attributions is preferable to having a greater number of ill-founded or erroneous attributions. For purposes of promoting knowledge about states’ behavior and development of norms to govern it, public attributions must be accurate and credible. Deterring unsubstantiated attributions is a feature, not a bug, of creating a customary international law standard for evidence to support public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)

### International law is essential for establishing effective cyberattack attribution standards.

> “If evidentiary standards for attribution should be legal standards, which law should do the work—domestic or international? Although domestic legal standards currently govern some attributions, this Subpart argues that such standards are insufficient, and states should develop international law. What may begin as lex specialis on evidence for cyberattack attributions has the potential to crystallize the murky lex generalis of international law on evidence.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 572)

### U.S. attributions by indictment operate under a low probable cause standard.

> “Some of the mechanisms that the United States uses for attributions are already governed by U.S. domestic legal standards. The role of domestic law is clearest with respect to attributions-by-indictment. Federal prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury, which “may return an indictment if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the persons indicted.”233 A grand jury need not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a crime, but only that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed the crime alleged.234 The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that probable cause “is not a high bar: It requires only the kind of fair probability on which reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.”235” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 54)

### Economic sanctions by the Treasury can be imposed with a reasonable basis, reflecting a low standard.

> “The standard for imposition of economic sanctions is also low. In consultation with other departments, the Treasury Department can impose sanctions if there is a “reasonable basis to determine that the target meets the criteria for designation” under the relevant statutory and administrative scheme.236 The executive branch “acts as the functional prosecutor, fact finder and review board,” subject only to highly deferential review by courts.237 A court reviewing a designation appl[ies] the [Administrative Procedure Act’s] ‘highly deferential standard,’ meaning that [it] may set aside Treasury’s action “only if it is ‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’”238” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 574)

### Not all U.S. attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, relying on estimative language.

> “Even in the United States, not all of the attribution mechanisms are governed by legal standards, and states are under no obligation to employ ones that are. Attributions-by-alert often use “estimative language” from the intelligence community, deploying standards that are not legally defined or reviewable in court.239 For example, a report by the U.S. ODNI on Russian election interference notes that the intelligence community “assess[es] with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.”240 Other governments use the same estimative language.241 Attributions by press release or official statement may not articulate any standard at all.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 575)

### Domestic legal standards may be inadequate for attributing cyber wrongdoing by foreign states.

> “Even if states relied solely on mechanisms governed by their domestic legal standards, domestic law would still be insufficient to govern attributions. Domestic legal standards for things like criminal charges vary between states. Moreover, existing domestic legal standards for attributions governed by such standards are not in practice subject to judicial review as they are in more run-of-the-mill cases. In the United States, indictments and sanctions are typically subject to at least some post hoc judicial review, but attributions-by-indictment or other mechanisms have generally escaped judicial review because the defendants are not in U.S. custody and have not appeared in U.S. courts to challenge sanctions.242 These kinds of attributions may also serve as the predicate to countermeasures responsive actions against an aggressor state that would violate international law but for the aggressor’s prior wrongful act;243 such countermeasures have also not been subject to judicial review.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 575)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:a. The Insufficiency of Domestic Law

### Domestic law evidentiary standards may not suffice for accusations against foreign governments.

> “In addition, even for the United States, one could reasonably argue that domestic law standards of probable cause for an indictment and reasonable basis for sanctions are insufficient when what is at stake is an accusation of wrongdoing by a foreign government. The domestic legal standards are tied to due process protections for the individuals and entities subject to indictment or sanctions, and, as a matter of U.S. constitutional law, the standards are understood as sufficient to serve that purpose. But the attributions by indictment and attributions by sanctions are serving multiple purposes, and at least arguably, the dominant one is communicating to foreign governments what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace.244 Domestic law sets a floor, but the amount of evidence necessary to satisfy constitutional due process with respect to, for example, an accusation of unauthorized access to a computer or theft of intellectual property, may well be insufficient to serve the alternative purpose of fostering the development of norms and customary international law about state behavior in cyberspace. Domestic and international evidentiary standards would not conflict in this circumstance; rather, the international law evidentiary standard would simply require more detail and evidence in indictments that accuse foreign governments of cyberattacks.245” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576)

### Divergent domestic legal standards hinder consensus on international cyber attribution.

> “Additionally, reliance on varied domestic law standards to govern attributions is unlikely to generate consensus among states about how attributions should be made. For issues related to the permissibility (or not) of state behavior vis-à-vis other states, there is significant value in having agreed legal standards. States are coequal sovereigns in the international system, not usually subordinates governed by each other’s domestic laws. Domestic legal standards especially divergent ones—cannot reasonably be expected to generate crossnational agreement on the bounds of permissible state behavior any more than disparate policy choices can.246 That is the domain of international law.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576)

### A mix of existing and new international law is required for cyberattack evidence.

> “The turn to international law raises a familiar dilemma in the cybersecurity context and for new technologies more broadly about the extent to which the best approach is to apply general, existing international law, or instead to develop new law.247 Often, applying existing international law is sufficient, but in the context of the evidentiary standards for attribution, the underdeveloped nature of existing international law on evidence suggests that a mix of existing and new international law will be required.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 576)

### States must meet a clear evidence standard for armed cyberattacks.

> “For the very high end of state action—namely forcible self defense some state practice supports a requirement that a victim state must meet a clear and convincing or clear and compelling evidence standard.248 For cyberattacks that reach the level of an armed attack, states contemplating responsive actions would be governed by this standard, to the extent that it is a customary international law requirement. Setting a high standard for attributions involving the most severe cyberattacks would be consistent with the ICJ’s suggestion of a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the offense: an attribution of a cyber armed attack to a state requires the strongest evidentiary basis.249 The Tallinn Manual endorses a similar sliding scale approach, arguing that “the graver the underlying breach . . . , the greater the confidence ought to be in the evidence relied upon by a State considering a response . . . because the robustness of permissible self-help responses (such as retorsion, countermeasures, a plea of necessity, and self-defence) grows commensurately with the seriousness of a breach.”250” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 58)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### The sliding scale of evidence lacks clarity for the majority of cyberattacks.

> ““Adopting a sliding scale of evidence based on the severity of the cyberattack and the anticipated response provides some guidance for the ends of the scale. But it provides little clarity for everything in between the space where the vast majority of cyberattacks occur. Such attacks would fall within the countermeasures framework, and as explained above, there is no consensus on the evidentiary standards governing states’ use of countermeasures beyond a very general requirement to act reasonably.251” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 577)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### The sliding scale approach does not address other purposes of attribution.

> “Moreover, the sliding scale approach, at least as justified by the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, relies entirely on one possible purpose of attribution, namely, justifying responsive action. It says nothing about the quantum of evidence that might be required for other purposes attributions might serve, and it does not consider the extent to which an absolute evidentiary minimum standard might be required for such other purposes.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 577)

### Evidence-free attributions undermine stability in cyberspace.

> “Take the systemic purpose of promoting stability in and avoiding conflict over cyberspace. To serve this purpose, attributions should be accompanied by at least some evidence. Evidence-free attributions do not promote stability, and they may in fact undermine it by creating chaos and increasing the risk of escalation of conflict among states. To foster stability, the amount of evidence should be sufficient to enable crosschecking or corroboration of the attribution. Providing sufficient technical details to allow other potential attributors—companies, governments, and academic experts—to confirm (or debunk) an attribution will bolster the attribution’s credibility.252 Improving the credibility of attributions in turn leads to greater agreement about the factual realities of states’ behavior in cyberspace and may foster development of agreed norms or customary international law about permissible behavior.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### Requiring evidence improves decision-making in attribution.

> “Moreover, a requirement for attributors to “show their work” by providing evidence to support and explain the attribution should incentivize more careful and better reasoned attributions in the first place. This argument is familiar from numerous contexts,253 including U.S. administrative law. There, the requirement that agencies explain the basis for their decisions so that they can be subject to review (by courts, in the administrative context) is understood to foster better decision making ex ante,254 and accountability for decisions ex post.255” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 578)

### A crosschecking requirement sets a minimum evidentiary standard.

> “The requirement of sufficient evidence to allow crosschecking would set a floor on the evidence needed to accompany an attribution. Importantly, this floor is independent of the type of responsive action the attributing state may or may not choose to undertake, unlike the sliding scale approach from the ICJ and the Tallinn Manual, which alters the evidence required based on the severity of the attack or anticipated response. The two approaches can be applied in tandem. For severe attacks and significant responses, the sliding scale approach would suggest more than just enough evidence to permit crosschecking, but for less severe incidents, the crosschecking requirement sets an evidentiary floor. That is, even in instances where a victim state’s only response to a cyberattack is attempted naming-and-shaming through public attribution to the perpetrator state, the victim state would be required to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 579)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### Crosschecking evidence enhances the credibility of attributions.

> “Crosschecking could take the form of either replication of an attribution by others using evidence provided by the original attributor, or corroboration of the initial attribution by combining evidence from the initial attributor with additional information in the possession of subsequent attributors. The gold standard for provision of evidence to support an attribution is Mandiant’s APT1 report, which included detailed explanations of the evidence on which Mandiant relied in identifying members of the Chinese PLA and provided technical appendices that other entities could use.256 CrowdStrike’s attribution of the DNC hack was also subject to crosschecking, with multiple firms analyzing malware samples and building on information, notably IP addresses, that CrowdStrike provided to confirm the attribution.257 Some government attributions, particularly U.S. attributions-by-indictment, have been quite detailed, although they do not include as many technical details as private sector attributions.258 In some circumstances, this is a question of form. An indictment or press release does not lend itself to providing indicators of compromise. Nonetheless, the U.S. government has released technical details via DHS alerts in some cases, including those like WannaCry, where other attribution mechanisms are also deployed.259” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 60)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### Attributions should allow for corroboration to improve legitimacy.

> “Defining the standard of evidence in a functionalist manner based on its key feature of enabling crosschecking is more robust than simply trying to apply a formalist descriptor. Even in the U.S. domestic system, which employs numerous descriptors for evidentiary standards, there is confusion about the precise meaning of different linguistic formulations.260 Choosing a single descriptor that would have to be translated internationally may cause further confusion. The crosschecking standard deliberately combines a requirement to disclose evidence with a minimum amount of evidence requirement. Such a standard furthers the goal of promoting stability in cyberspace because it suggests broad agreement about the truth of attributions, and it is the agreed factual reality promoted by credible attributions that fosters stability in and helps to avoid conflict over cyberspace. If one were to map an existing evidentiary standard onto the crosschecking requirement’s amount of evidence threshold, it would likely be something akin to a preponderance of the evidence standard.261 A preponderance is generally understood to mean that something is more likely than not to be true.262 Thus, the crosschecking standard’s amount and disclosure requirements might be understood together as akin to a verifiable preponderance standard.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 580)

### Establishing an international law standard for evidence is essential.

> “Adopting an evidentiary standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking would also serve the other possible purposes of attribution. Consider macro-level deterrence. For an attribution to foster macro level deterrence requires at least an implied threat of punishment—a responsive action such as countermeasures.263 For countermeasures to be viewed as lawful requires the state contemplating taking them to convince other states that it was the victim of an internationally wrongful act. Providing sufficient evidence to allow other states to verify the attribution and thus the accused state’s wrongful act—would make the threat of countermeasures more credible, increasing the deterrent effect of the attribution.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581)

### Attributions must be supported by evidence to enable countermeasures.

> “Creating micro-level deterrence by imposing costs on particular government-sponsored hackers could also be accomplished by providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. In the United States, indictments are governed by probable cause and sanctions require a reasonable basis. These domestic law standards could easily be satisfied by a requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, though the reverse might not be true, as explained above.264 Particularly with respect to attributions by-sanction, the evidence offered to date has been minimal. Although likely sufficient to meet the domestic law standard, more detail would be required to enable crosschecking. For criminal indictments that proceed to trial, the domestic law standard could outpace the international one: evidence sufficient to prove an individual’s criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt could exceed the international law requirement to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking. International law would then merely provide a floor, while domestic due process requirements would push the evidentiary standard higher at the time of trial.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 581)

### Violation allegations also necessitate supporting evidence.

> “Finally, consider attributions aimed at improving network defenses. Attributing an attack to a particular state is not necessary for hardening defenses, which can be accomplished with provision of indicators of compromise and other technical details without a public attribution. If an attribution-by-alert attributes simply to a state, without naming a particular state, then it does not constitute a public attribution and would not in any event be captured by a requirement of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking.265 If, however, an attribution that is aimed at spurring network defenders to harden their systems does name a particular state, then the evidence-sufficient-for-crosschecking requirement should apply. Even if the attribution is primarily intended to have defensive benefits, it also constitutes an accusation against a state, whose behavior and the state-based responses to it are constitutive of customary international law. Although at least some of the defensive benefits may accrue without sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, the broader systemic benefits of clarity and conflict avoidance require providing evidence.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)

### States' practices can help evolve customary international law.

> “The legitimacy of establishing an international law standard for the quantum of evidence required for cyberattack attribution is perhaps most obvious with respect to the high-end of state action and possible victim responses—cyberattacks that constitute an armed attack or use of force. But establishing an international law standard is desirable in other contexts too, and indeed may have a greater beneficial effect because existing international law on evidence-giving is even less clear for actions below the armed attack threshold.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### Credibility and state relations affect evidentiary requirements.

> “Some cyberattacks below the armed attack threshold will constitute a use of force or another violation of international law, such as a violation of the principle of nonintervention.266 In such cases, the attribution involves an allegation of a violation of international law, and allegations of lawbreaking should be supported with evidence to enable crosschecking of the allegation by, for example, other states and the United Nations. If the victim reasonably alleges a violation of international law, then it will be entitled to take countermeasures.267 The allegation of wrongdoing changes the legal relationship between the states involved. In such a circumstance, evidence to support the existence and attribution of the initial wrongful act is crucial to enable assessments of the legality of the victim state’s subsequent countermeasures.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)

### Nongovernmental attributors should adhere to international standards.

> “For attributions that do not involve an allegation of violating existing international law, an international law evidentiary standard is, paradoxically, perhaps even more desirable. From the perspective of progressively developing customary international law or at least norms to govern state behavior in cyberspace, it is most important to clarify state practice in the gray area where the primary rules governing what states may and may not do are currently unclear. Public attributions supported by evidence can foster greater understanding of and agreement on what state practice is, and from state practice, norms or customary international law to govern behavior can evolve.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 582)

### Creating a lex specialis for cybersecurity could evolve into a general norm.

> “Importantly, establishing an evidentiary standard for public attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks is not the same as setting an evidentiary standard for accusations related to activity that clearly does not violate international law. Traditional espionage is a good example. International law is generally understood not to prohibit espionage, although espionage violates states’ domestic law.268 In expelling alleged spies, states often provide no evidence to support their actions. And establishing a lex specialis in the context of cyberattacks would not require a change in this practice. Rather, for all of the reasons discussed above,269 setting a standard in the cybersecurity context is particularly important and useful. At least some of the state-sponsored behavior at issue in public attributions made to date will likely come to be viewed as violating customary international law governing state behavior—it is just not presently clear which activities will fall in that category.270” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 583)

### The crosschecking standard emphasizes verification for attribution accuracy.

> “The process for establishing the proposed international law requirement for evidence-giving is fairly straightforward.271 Customary international law requires general state practice undertaken out of a sense of legal obligation (opinio juris). Practice among states that have made state-to-state attributions, including the most recent coordinated attributions, has in some cases come close to providing sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking or corroboration.272 Going forward, all governmental attributions should provide sufficient evidence to allow other governmental and nongovernmental actors to confirm or debunk the attributions. This may mean combining attributions by indictment, sanctions, or press release with attributions-by-alert, where technical details can be included more easily.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 583)

## II. The Law of Attribution:B. Legalizing Cyberattack Attribution:2. Law for Cyberattack Attribution:b. Customary International Law for Evidence-Giving and Attribution

### The lack of evidence law presents an opportunity for new standards.

> “That leaves the second component of customary international law, namely, opinio juris. The United States, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as explained above, have disavowed a legal obligation.273 That should change. And it can change quickly and easily. One of the clearest indications of opinio juris is “an express public statement on behalf of a State that a given practice is permitted, prohibited or mandated under customary international law.”274 States could begin including references to customary international law in statements they issue announcing attributions. But state practice need not be limited to states that make attributions themselves. States that do not make attributions could also contribute to the development of international law by including references to international law in statements supporting other states’ attributions or in rejecting evidence-free attributions. Importantly, to establish a rule of customary international law, “[i]t is not necessary to establish that all States have recognized (accepted as law) the alleged rule,” but rather “it is broad and representative acceptance, together with no or little objection, that is required.”275 Such representative acceptance seems within reach if attributing states alter their stance.276 This optimism is especially warranted if attributing states are joined by other states that evaluate public attributions and declare whether or not the attributions are sufficient for purposes of international law.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 584)

### Credibility and state relations affect evidentiary requirements.

> “In addition, states that do not themselves engage in attributions or wish to comment on particular attributions could contribute to the formation of customary international law through voting and participation in deliberations in the United Nations. For example, states might participate in U.N. General Assembly resolutions dealing with attributions and the evidentiary standard.277 Such resolutions could help both to constitute customary international law and reflect that such law has already crystallized by revealing the existence of opinio juris for a broad range of states.278 States could also participate in one of the two ongoing U.N. groups devoted to developing international norms for cyberspace, the Open-Ended Working Group and the Group of Governmental Experts—both of which may issue reports relevant to customary international law.279” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 585)

### Nongovernmental attributors should adhere to international standards.

> “Taken together, the development of consistent and uniform state practice with respect to evidence giving and opinio juris reflecting a felt obligation to provide such evidence can help to level the playing field with respect to the evidentiary basis of attributions. In international politics, the credibility of the state offering evidence and that state’s relations with other states can affect the amount of evidence required for a state to be believed.280 Establishing a legal standard of sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of an attribution decreases the role of reputation and makes the assessment of an attribution’s accuracy and veracity more objective—a feature sorely needed in an international realm increasingly divided into adversarial blocs over the governance of cyberspace and many other issues.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 585)

### Establishing a standard could enhance shared knowledge in cyberspace.

> “Although international law directly binds only states, nongovernmental attributors should consider abiding by the international law standard for evidence giving as well. Indeed, many nongovernmental attributions already meet the proposed standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking, so the proposed standard would require little to no change in behavior by many nongovernmental attributors. Nonetheless, a commitment by nongovernmental attributors to provide sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking of their attributions would be beneficial. It would both establish an industry standard  practice for other nongovernmental attributors to meet281 and ensure that nongovernmental attributions contribute to shared and agreed knowledge about state behavior in cyberspace, along with the stability and conflict-avoidance benefits such clarity would foster.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 586)

### Creating a lex specialis for cybersecurity could evolve into a general norm.

> “The paucity of existing international law on evidence presents immediate challenges for cyberattack attribution, but it also provides an opportunity to create an evidentiary lex specialis, tailored to the cybersecurity context. Adoption of and advocacy for the evidentiary standard by even a few states with significant cyberattack capabilities or high-profile victim states could begin the process of establishing a norm that could then, over time, harden into customary international law.282 Some of the benefits of an evidentiary standard—including providing clarity about what’s required for credible attributions, fostering transparency about states’ behavior in cyberspace, and setting out markers for impermissible state behavior—could manifest even while the standard is merely a norm. However, achieving other benefits, especially mandating evidence-giving by recalcitrant states, would require the standard to crystallize into customary international law.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 586)

### The crosschecking standard emphasizes verification for attribution accuracy.

> “The proposed evidentiary standard of providing sufficient evidence to enable crosschecking is particularly important in the cybersecurity context where so little is publicly known about what states are actually doing and where significant resources for verifying attribution claims exist outside of governments. But the crosschecking standard may have broader utility. It is essentially a standard founded on the idea of “trust, but verify,” with a heavy emphasis on verification. Setting an evidentiary standard that enables and promotes verification by governmental and nongovernmental entities alike of states’ claims about cyberattack attribution would help to ensure the accuracy of states’ accusations of wrongdoing and encourage broader acceptance of claims that are made. The lex specialis in the cybersecurity context has the potential to morph into lex generalis, bringing clarity to the evidentiary issues that states have muddled through in non–cybersecurity contexts, including, for example, evidentiary questions surrounding Iranian responsibility for mining tankers and shooting down a U.S. drone.283 The potential for lex specialis to transform into lex generalis raises the stakes for developing a robust and widely agreed evidentiary standard for attributing cyberattacks.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)

### Establishing evidentiary standards can enhance attribution credibility.

> “Setting an evidentiary standard for credible attributions could help to routinize attributions, but the question remains: attributions by whom? The current attribution system is decentralized, featuring a mix of governmental and nongovernmental attributors and of attribution mechanisms. Diverse entities in recent years have proposed that attributions should instead be centralized in a new international entity. These proposals have much to recommend them as additions to the attribution landscape. However, if this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard were adopted, centralization would be less crucial because crosschecking of disclosed evidence would provide an alternative means to establish the credibility of attributions. Moreover, preserving some amount of decentralization and a multiplicity of attributors may be the optimal design for attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks. Having a proliferation of credible attributors and mutually reinforcing attributions is more likely to maximize stability and foster development of primary norms of state behavior than resting attribution responsibilities in any single entity.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)

### Recent proposals suggest centralizing cyberattack attribution.

> “The problem of credibly attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks has prompted several recent proposals to centralize responsibility for attribution. The proposals differ in the extent to which the proposals’ authors believe states should be involved in attribution judgments. At one end of the spectrum, the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.based think tank, proposed a Multilateral Cyber Adjudication and Attribution Council consisting, as the use of “multilateral” in the title suggests, of states.284” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 587)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### The proposed Council aims to reach consensus on cyberattack attributions.

> “The Council would “provide an international mechanism for arriving at a consensus attribution of illegal cyber campaigns by states and a formal process for adjudicating associated interstate disputes.”285 The proposal contemplates that “[w]hen attribution is high confidence, the defendant state would be given an opportunity to present exculpating evidence and arguments,”286 and the Council can “issue a recommendation on steps to deescalate the malicious activity,” as well as “rule on damages” that the perpetrator owes to the victim.287” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588)

### Microsoft's proposal seeks a mixed governmental and nongovernmental attribution body.

> “At the midpoint of the spectrum, in a 2016 white paper, Microsoft proposed the establishment of an international institution for attribution of state-sponsored cyberattacks that would feature a mix of governmental and nongovernmental actors.288 Microsoft suggests modeling the body on the International Atomic Energy Agency and making it multistakeholder, “consist[ing] of technical experts from across governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society.”289 Microsoft envisions that the organization would produce a “technical analysis of the attack and evidence of attribution,” which it would sometimes publish.290 Microsoft acknowledges that the institution would need representatives from a “diverse set of nation-states and geographic regions,” including “[a]t a minimum . . . representatives from countries that are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.”291 The white paper further suggests that attribution reports “can be subject to peer review, improving the quality of the results.”292” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 588)

### RAND's proposal excludes governments from cyber attribution processes.

> “At the other end of the spectrum are proposals that deliberately exclude governments. Researchers at the RAND Corporation, in a report funded by Microsoft, went further than the Microsoft proposal.293 RAND proposes the establishment of a “Global Cyber Attribution Consortium” and emphasizes that the Consortium must have “broad membership across geopolitical lines to foster a diversity of perspectives and to minimize the possibility that its findings are tainted by political influence.”294 But crucially, the RAND researchers specifically argue that state representatives should not be part of the Consortium.295 Instead, the Consortium’s membership should be drawn from: “(1) technical experts from cybersecurity and information technology companies, as well as academia, and (2) cyberspace policy experts, legal scholars, and international policy experts from a diversity of academia and research organizations.”296 They argue that state participation is not necessary in light of the “significant expertise” outside the government, and that state participation creates difficulties because governments are often unwilling to disclose evidence on which attributions are based, states might try to “shape the Consortium’s findings to serve their national interests,” and states would try to direct the Consortium away from investigations that “might shed light on or otherwise threaten their own cyber operations.”297 A report published by researchers at the University of Washington’s School of Public Policy has similarly proposed an international attribution organization that would exclude governments,298 consisting instead of private sector representatives.299” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)

### Centralization proposals address concerns with the current attribution system.

> “The proposals to centralize attribution respond to problems with the current, decentralized system. Some of these problems stem from the inherent features of the current attributors, which raise serious questions about their credibility and objectivity. Government attributions may be politically motivated and lacking in transparency.300 Private sector attributions, on the other hand, may be driven by companies’ business incentives, which can lead to a rush to attribute, or by ties to governments that want the company to issue an attribution.301 An international entity with diverse geographic representation that issues careful, transparent attributions and lacks financial or political incentives to skew results would address these concerns.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 589)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Decentralization can help resolve confusion caused by numerous attributors.

> “Another set of concerns with the current system focuses on the confusion caused by having a proliferation of attributors, each of which has its own naming convention and techniques for identifying threat actors, often the same threat actors. For example, the Russian GRU is “known as Sofacy by Kaspersky, as APT28 by FireEye, STRONTIUM by Microsoft, and FANCY BEAR by CrowdStrike.”302 Having a centralized attribution entity could address this by “creat[ing] a formal nomenclature system so that the attacks can be universally referenced in future investigations.”303 It could also “help standardize diffuse methodological approaches . . . and confidence metrics that would advance shared understanding in cyberspace and promote global cybersecurity.”304” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### An international entity could improve cyber attribution access for victims.

> “Finally, having an international attribution entity could improve access to attribution resources among victims. Cyberattack victims often “either cannot afford cyber attribution assistance or do not know where to turn for help.”305 This holds true not only for nongovernmental victims, but also for states that have less advanced intelligence and cybersecurity capacities.306 An international entity could help by providing a clear point of contact for victims and bringing to bear the resources of sophisticated cyber actors to help victims that lack resources to make the attribution themselves or to hire private companies to investigate for them.307 This function would become especially important if states take up this Article’s proposal for setting an evidentiary standard for public attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks. One potential downside of the proposal is its possible differential impact: states with sophisticated cyber capabilities will have an easier time meeting any evidentiary standard, while those with less sophisticated capabilities may nonetheless be victims of cyberattacks and yet unable to meet the evidentiary standard required to make a public attribution to the perpetrator. An international attribution entity could help to mitigate this differential impact by making attribution resources available to less sophisticated states.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 590)

### Proposals for centralized attribution carry risks of credibility reliance.

> “The proposals, particularly those that preserve an important or even dominant role for nongovernmental attributors, have much to recommend them. At the same time, there are significant risks to relying on a centralized attribution model. First, and most importantly, centralizing attributions makes the credibility of attributions dependent on the credibility of a single entity. The proposals attempt to address this issue by calling for diverse geographic representation among participants in the new attribution entity. But that will be difficult to achieve. Major cyber powers, particularly China, have repeatedly (and opportunistically) suggested that “attribution is nearly impossible.”308 Gaining participation from such countries and their allies will be difficult, and without it, the credibility of the entity will be undermined for a large swath of the world.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 591)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Resource constraints may limit the effectiveness of an international attribution entity.

> “Second, an international attribution entity would likely be resource constrained. Resource constraints could limit the number of cyberattacks the entity could investigate, raising the need for other attributors to pursue additional investigations. Resource constraints could also manifest in a different way, namely, that attaining high confidence on particular attributions might require the all-source intelligence resources of powerful states—resources that quite likely would not be available to the new entity. The international attribution entity then could not cover the field of cyberattacks in need of attribution.309” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 591)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Balancing government involvement in attribution poses fundamental challenges.

> “A new attribution entity faces fundamental hurdles. Bringing governments into the organization risks corrupting the attribution process. Leaving them out risks hampering the entity’s access to necessary intelligence information and preventing it from making attributions in particularly significant cyberattacks. And having some governments in and some governments out may exacerbate the perception that the entity’s attributions are politicized or that its choice of cases to investigate is skewed.310” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 592)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Centralized attribution should complement the existing decentralized system.

> “All of these challenges suggest that while there is value to creating an entity in some form, it should become an additional participant in the current decentralized attribution system—centralization within decentralization as it were. This is effectively an argument for what Heather Gerken has called “second-order diversity,” that is, for “variation among decision-making bodies, not within them” (or not just within them).311 An international attribution entity could seek to achieve “first-order diversity,” attempting to have participants proportionately mirror the landscape of entities involved in cyberattacks and cyberattack attribution.312 But where achieving that goal is unlikely, it is useful to recognize the benefits of second-order diversity.313” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 592)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### A decentralized system can foster diverse and credible attributions.

> “The decentralized attribution system, with its various forms of attributors, has a number of virtues that have gone un- or underappreciated.314 First, if attributors adopt this Article’s proposed evidentiary standard for attributions, the need for a centralized attribution entity would decrease. Instead of relying on a single entity’s epistemic authority to ensure the credibility of attributions,315 the evidentiary standard provides a means of diffusing credibility: attributions will be deemed credible not based on who makes them,316 but rather based on their compliance with the evidentiary standard and consequent ability to be verified and corroborated. A new attribution entity could contribute to the parade of evidence-supported attributions, but it need not be the only game in town. The proposed evidentiary standard fosters credibility because of decentralization and the promise of multiple attributors verifying attributions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 593)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Decentralization promotes transparency in attributing state actions.

> “Second, decentralization can foster transparency about states’ actions more quickly. Different attributors can publicly accuse states whenever they, based on their own investigations, are satisfied that they have successfully identified the perpetrators. In many instances, this will mean a cascade of attributions over time. The overall credibility of an attribution is not set at a single early point in time, but builds along with confirmatory attributions. In other words, with a decentralized system, attributions need not be tied to the timetable set by the most hesitant attributor.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 593)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### A multiplicity of attributors can yield more diverse attributions.

> “Numerous attributions bear out the transparency benefits of a multiplicity of attributors.317 For example, the Mandiant APT1 report accused Chinese PLA officers of IP theft more than a year before the U.S. government was ready to indict one of the same officers.318 Perhaps the best example of the transparency benefits of rolling attributions is the process of attributing the DNC hack. The first attribution to Russia came from CrowdStrike, which investigated the hack for the DNC, in June 2016.319 By July 2016, other security researchers confirmed CrowdStrike’s claim.320 These attributions provided crucial transparency about Russia’s efforts to influence the U.S. elections, and they did so months before the U.S. government first attributed the cyberattacks to Russia only weeks before the election.321 Responsive actions, at least in the form of sanctions, took additional months,322 and an indictment charging Russian intelligence officials came only in July 2018.323 The most recent additions are attributions of the DNC hack to Russia from Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, announced as part of a coordinated attribution campaign in October 2018.324 If all of these attributors were to participate in an international attribution entity, it is doubtful that the attribution would have come as early as it did, and perhaps not even before the 2016 election. A centralized attribution entity could boost credibility by confirming attributions made at the earliest possible time by, for example, private cybersecurity companies. But relying solely on a centralized mechanism risks slowing accusations, at a significant potential cost to transparency in sufficient time to respond to or guard against the effects of ongoing bad acts.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 594)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Different attributors can appeal to various audiences, enhancing credibility.

> “Third, a multiplicity of attributors is likely to result in more and different attributions. A centralized entity would have to make choices about how to allocate scarce resources, but a decentralized system has the potential to foster a greater number of resources devoted to attributions overall. One risk of private attributions is that they are driven by companies’ marketing concerns. But, on the other hand, the marketing benefits of attributing state-sponsored cyberattacks channel companies’ business interests in the direction of more attributions. They get credit for outing state cyberattacks in a way that they likely would not by participating in a broad-based international entity.325 An attribution by the entity would not redound to the business benefit of a particular company in the same way, and thus centralization could disincentivize companies to devote as many resources to publicizing attributions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 594)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Importantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution.

> “Decentralization also opens the door to different attributions. As noted above,326 some nongovernmental attributions have focused on espionage by governments that endangers human rights. Those sorts of attributions would be more difficult to do under the auspices of an international entity, at least one that included governments.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 594)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### The ad hoc approach can facilitate diversity and build trust among attributors.

> “Fourth, the decentralized attribution system has the potential to enhance the credibility of attributions. In particular, having a multiplicity of attributors productively harnesses attributors’ competitive instincts. Attributors have incentives to crosscheck attributions publicized by others an ability that would be fostered by the evidentiary rule proposed in Part II. Crosschecking resulted in confirmatory attributions by companies and governments with respect to the DNC hack.327 It has also resulted in some attempts to debunk attributions. A significant attempt to debunk a government attribution occurred when Norse, a “cyber intelligence company,” challenged the FBI’s attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea and claimed to have evidence that a Sony insider perpetrated the attack.328 After a briefing by Norse, the FBI reiterated its determination that North Korea was responsible,329 and ultimately released more information about why it was confident that was the case.330 To be sure, crosschecking could occur through more formalized peer review within an international attribution entity, serving the same purpose of potentially improving the quality and credibility of attributions.331 But again, that could be in addition to the ad hoc, competitively incentivized peer review currently occurring as part of the decentralized attribution system.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Increased confirmatory attributions can strengthen the decentralized system.

> “Another way the decentralized attribution system bolsters the credibility of attributions is by at least potentially broadening the audience of those who will credit attributions. Put simply, different attributors—or different kinds of attributors—may persuade different audiences. For example, cybersecurity researchers who are skeptical of government attributions without detailed evidence may nonetheless credit corporate attributions accompanied by indicators of compromise and other technical evidence. Or members of the cybersecurity community who previously worked for government intelligence agencies might credit even parsimonious attributions by former colleagues. Foreign governments might not put much stock in corporate attributions, but might, as appears to be the case, credit other governments’ attributions, particularly if the attributing government privately shares the intelligence on which its attribution is based (even when it declines to do so publicly). Attributions can have a multiplicity of audiences—and thus having a multiplicity of attributors can be useful in ensuring that a wide swath of interested parties will credit at least one of the attributors of a particular attack, even if they would not believe others, at least acting alone.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 595)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### All of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.

> “Finally, the decentralized attribution system may create the potential for broader participation. Although the proposals for an international entity envision diverse participation, ad hoc information sharing on particular cases may be an easier way to promote diversity among attributors and to build trust. There are certainly costs to an ad hoc approach,332 but many potential attributors may be more comfortable with a case-by-case approach to information sharing than with a standing information-sharing pool as envisioned in an international entity. For companies and experts in some regions of the world, it might be difficult or even dangerous to participate in what is likely to be (at least for now) a Western-led entity. But they might be able to participate in certain attribution projects. Think of a Chinese company that might participate in an ad hoc attribution to Russia, but not in one to the Chinese government. Or for that matter, a former U.S. intelligence official at a U.S. company who could participate in an attribution to North Korea, but not one to the United States. The ad hoc case-by-case collaboration approach allows for more tailored choices among experts about when to participate and when and with whom to share information.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 596)

### The ad hoc approach can facilitate diversity and build trust among attributors.

> “The ad hoc approach leaves the door open for some of the benefits sought from an international entity, including standardization of nomenclature identifying threat groups and development of more consistent methodologies among attributors, and by bringing in a more diverse set of experts, it may help to promote a shared understanding of the factual reality of states’ behavior in cyberspace. Ideally, diverse participation on particular cases could serve as a confidence-building mechanism that might help to foster more diverse participation in an attribution entity going forward.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 596)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Importantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution.

> “All of the potential benefits of the decentralized attribution system would be bolstered in the short-term by greater proliferation of confirmatory attributions.333 As discussed above, such attributions have begun to occur, but they are still quite limited. Among governments, confirmatory attributions have come mostly from the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing partnership (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), plus a few other allies, such as Estonia, Japan, and the Netherlands. Similarly, the confirmatory nongovernmental attributions have mostly come from Western companies and other entities. The decentralized attributions would have greater credibility if done by attributors diverse on a number of metrics—geography, political system, governmental/nongovernmental status, etc.334 The benefits of having a broadly shared understanding about the factual reality of states’ behavior in cyberspace should weigh heavily in any calculus about the undoubtedly real costs of sharing intelligence more broadly or being more transparent about the evidence supporting an attribution.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)

## III. DESIGNING ATTRIBUTION

### Diversity of attributors can enhance confirmatory attributions.

> “Importantly, the diversity of attributors could come after an initial attribution in the decentralized system. As more attributors confirm an attribution and release more information, additional diverse attributors could pile on. The push for more diverse attributions by a greater number of attributors is thus a call both to those entities that are currently making public attributions to share more information and more broadly and to other governments, security companies, and experts around the world to join in, examine public evidence offered to support attributions, and issue statements of their own confirming (or disputing) public attributions.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)

## Conclusion

### International law is necessary to standardize cyberattack attribution among states.

> “Cyberattack attributions aren’t just political. Politics may partly determine whether attributions are made public, but law should govern how public attributions are made. Although domestic law has a part to play with respect to some attribution mechanisms, the divergences in states’ domestic legal standards and the fact that some frequently used attribution mechanisms are not subject to domestic law at all suggests that international law must step in to unify attribution requirements across states. The proposed functionally defined evidentiary standard requiring that attributors provide sufficient evidence to permit crosschecking will harness both governmental and nongovernmental attribution capabilities to bring clarity about states’ actions in cyberspace. The goals that public attributions are intended to achieve—from bolstering defenses, to deterrence, to improving stability in cyberspace—will be best served by maintaining a multiplicity of attributors, alongside any future international attribution entity.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 597)

## Conclusion

### Enhanced attribution practices can clarify legal standards for state behavior in cyberspace.

> “Improving the quality, frequency, breadth, and scope of acceptance of attributions of state-sponsored cyberattacks can promote an agreed factual reality about states’ behavior in cyberspace. Clarity on such facts can contribute to eventual legal clarity about permissible state behavior in the enormous and tremendously important gray zones below the level of an armed attack and outside the context of armed conflict.” (Eichensehr, 2020, p. 598)
