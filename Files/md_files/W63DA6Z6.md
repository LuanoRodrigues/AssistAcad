# <h1>ADDRESSING OBSTACLES TO CYBER-ATTRIBUTION: A MODEL BASED ON STATE RESPONSE TO CYBER-ATTACK</h1>

## Introduction

### The increasing dependence on IT complicates the application of jus ad bellum due to notable cyber-attacks.

> “The international law of jus ad bellum—the law surrounding the use of force by states outside of armed conflict—has always been fraught with political complications and potential legal ambiguity.1 As states have become increasingly dependent on information technology, attack methods targeting information technology infrastructure have begun to receive recognition as a significant issue in the application of jus ad bellum.2 While milestone cyberattacks against Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack against Iran in 2010 are relatively well-known,3 numerous other states have found themselves victims.4 Consequently the United States and United Kingdom have both recognized cyber-attack as a major threat to their respective national securities.5” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 535)

## Introduction

### Cyber-attacks present unique challenges that existing public international law struggles to address.

> “Cyber-attacks have properties that make them quite different from existing modes of warfare, and it remains uncertain precisely how public international law should deal with this new mode of attack.6 In particular, it is unclear whether existing legal rules are suitably equipped to deal with the novel characteristics of cyberwarfare, or instead, if and to what degree new rules need to be developed.7 The result is a raft of partly legal and partly technical questions, generally without clear answers. Although there has been much scholarly writing on the subject, state practice varies and there is no international jurisprudence to assist with these specific questions.8 Indeed, the only extant legal “rules” on the topic are those proposed by scholars.9 The academic literature has therefore had an unusually large impact on the understanding of the law in this emerging area.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)

## Introduction

### Attributing state responsibility for cyber-attacks is recognized as a significant legal obstacle.

> “Although scholars have analyzed a range of issues surrounding the law of cyber-attack, the question of how to attribute state responsibility in the event of a cyber-attack has been recognized as a significant hurdle.10 Indeed, national security law expert Daniel B. Silver has described attribution as the most important practical obstacle to applying the law of jus ad bellum to cyber-attack.11” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)

## Introduction

### The article proposes a model for cyber-attribution to mitigate conflict escalation and encourage cooperation.

> “This Article discusses some of the legal issues surrounding cyberattack generally, and cyber-attribution in particular. Leveraging existing jurisprudence, established international law, and state practice, it proposes a model for cyber-attribution that minimizes the risk of conflict escalation and encourages states to cooperate and pursue peaceful means of resolving disputes arising from cyber-incidents.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 536)

## Introduction

### The article outlines the structure and focus areas of its discussion on cyber-attacks and jus ad bellum.

> “The Article begins in Part I by providing a brief overview regarding the nature of cyber-attacks, and particularly some of their unusual properties. Part II follows with a review of the rules of jus ad bellum, especially the prohibition against force and the right of self-defense. Part III then outlines states’ lawful options when responding to cyber-attack, focusing on how the rules of jus ad bellum may apply to this emerging form of conflict. Part IV then discusses the problems that cyber-attribution poses which practically inhibit the ability to apply existing international laws to cyberattack scenarios. Finally, Part V presents and discusses a model that aims to resolve these problems.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### Cyber-attacks are defined as state uses of information technology to harm another state's interests.

> “For the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are defined as those whereby states utilize computers and information technology as the primary mechanisms to detrimentally impact the interests of another state. In short, cyber-attack involves information technology employed as a weapon. Although some definitions of the term might include traditional kinetic attacks targeted at computing infrastructure,12 a more useful definition when concentrating on the unique characteristics of cyber-attacks and the challenges these present focuses on the notional weapon rather than the target.13 Cyber-attacks involve a variety of attack mechanisms, targets, and consequences, which makes difficult clear identification of a common set of characteristics, compared with traditional kinetic attacks.14 Combined with the relative newness of cyber-attack, these attributes create the potential for significant legal ambiguity.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### The complexity of computer systems allows for a vast array of cyber-attack methods.

> “Moreover, the complexity and flexibility of reprogrammable computer systems produce a seemingly infinite variety of potential attack methods.15 The outcomes and constraints of these methods will generally depend upon the precise details of specific systems and their vulnerabilities. Consequently, any attempt at a definitive taxonomy is likely to have a degree of artificiality and be, at best, only temporarily accurate. For this reason, for the purposes of this Article, cyber-attacks are instead classified into one or more of three general categories.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 537)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### Cyber-attacks can be categorized into direct intrusion, indirect intrusion, and denial of service attacks.

> “First, direct intrusion attacks are those where the attacker directly interacts with a computer system and gains some form of unauthorized access or control. Second, indirect intrusion attacks involve malicious code or “malware” that the attacker constructs in order to compromise a set of systems.16 In most cases this code will be self-propagating, delivering a payload in the form of specific actions once it gains access to a system.17 Third, denial of service attacks involve rendering the system unable to provide its expected services.18 A common variant of these is the distributed denial of service attack whereby large numbers of computer systems are compromised and used to collectively overwhelm a target with meaningless messages.19” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### Cyber-warfare is asymmetrically advantageous, often being inexpensive for attackers.

> “Cyber-attack of any type provides an attacker with significant advantages, making it highly asymmetric in nature.20 To begin with, cyber-warfare is typically inexpensive for the attacker.21 By one estimate, a devastating cyber-attack on the United States with damage lasting for many years could be deployed for approximately the cost of a single fighter aircraft.22 Unlike traditional kinetic warfare, a cyber-attack can be launched by a single appropriately skilled individual with a computer, an Internet connection, and a relatively small financial stake.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### States with greater dependence on information technology are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.

> “The vulnerability of states to cyber-attack also varies significantly.23 States with a greater investment in, and therefore dependence on, information technology have far greater potential exposure than those which are still developing in this area.24 Nations with extensive information technology infrastructures will often also be economically and militarily strong;25 notionally powerful states are therefore likely to be far more vulnerable to cyberattack than other means of coercion such as kinetic warfare or economic action.26” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 538)

## Part I: The Nature of Cyber-Attack

### Legal ambiguities in cyber-warfare enable aggressors to operate with relative safety.

> “Finally, the legal and factual ambiguity associated with cyber-warfare makes this a relatively safe mechanism for a prospective aggressor to employ. A victim state may simply not have sufficient evidence to prove who attacked it, and indeed may not even know the identity of the perpetrator.27 This problem is known as cyberattribution, the principal focus of this Article.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 539)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum

### Established Principles of Jus Ad Bellum Are Debated

> “The fundamental principles of jus ad bellum are well established. However, their precise application is often still subject to significant debate and disagreement. This Part summarizes these general principles as a basis for later discussion of how this law applies in relation to cyber-attack.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 539)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:A. Prohibition on the Use of Force

### The UN Charter prohibits the use of force as a peremptory norm of international law.

> “The prohibition against the threat or use of force is expressly articulated in the Charter of the United Nations (Charter) Article 2, Paragraph 4, and is considered to be a peremptory norm of international law.28 Notable instruments that preceded Article 2(4), such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, were framed as condemning “war” specifically, and thereby allowed military action that could be classified as action other than actual war.29 Article 2(4) remedied this potential loophole and sought to more thoroughly mitigate the risk of war by framing the prohibition in terms of “force” generally.30 However, with this approach the Charter framed wrongfulness in expressly instrumental terms, constrained by what is understood to constitute “force.” This potential ambiguity has led to debate as to whether the prohibition encompasses armed force or can be extended to economic coercion.31 The general consensus is that Article 2(4) refers only to armed force, and economic coercion is not included.32 Nonetheless, some arguments support a wider interpretation.33 The same question arises with regards to nonmilitary physical force, although again a conservative approach prevails that generally excludes economically coercive acts from the prohibition on force.34 In contrast, there is a strong consensus that indirect force against another state involving the use of irregulars or rebels will generally breach the prohibition.35” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 540)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:A. Prohibition on the Use of Force

### The UN Charter's definition of force raises questions regarding new weaponry and focuses on consequences.

> “The “cognitive shortcut” employed by the drafters of the Charter in terms of force as a coercive mechanism36 has also led to questions about its applicability to new forms of weaponry.37 This issue has led to the practical adoption of an approach to evaluating force that focuses primarily on the consequences, rather than the means employed.38” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 540)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:Article 51 and Armed Attack

### defense if an armed attack occurs.

> “The Charter’s Article 51 provides that nothing in that document “shall impair the inherent right of . . . [self-defense] if an armed attack occurs.”39 This provision points to the origins of the right to self-defense in customary international law.40 However, until the advent of the prohibition against war, and ultimately also against the use of force, the right to self-defense was of limited practical legal significance.41 With the constraints on states that now exist by virtue of the Charter and the subsequent evolution of international norms, the nature and limits of this right have gained significance as one of the few ways that a state may unilaterally, lawfully use force.42” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 540)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:Article 51 and Armed Attack

### defense is only applicable in response to an armed attack, constrained by the Charter.

> “As expressed in Article 51, the first constraint on the right to selfdefense is that it applies only in the event of an “armed attack.”43 Despite its origins in custom, the Charter states that it does not impair the inherent right to self-defense if an armed attack occurs, arguably implying that any previous customary right to self-defense that may have existed in the absence of such an attack has been constrained or entirely discarded. Therefore, the right to selfdefense is implicated only in the event of an armed attack, and the critical question becomes precisely what such an attack entails.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 541)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:Article 51 and Armed Attack

### The definition of 'armed attack' is critical and more ambiguous than the prohibition against the use of force.

> “The meaning of the term “armed attack” is therefore critical.49 As with the prohibition against force, by framing the right to selfdefense as permissible only in response to an armed attack, the drafters of the Charter again adopted a means-based approach.50 However, the threshold required for an armed attack is more ambiguous than for the prohibition against the use of force, but is even more important.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 541)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:Article 51 and Armed Attack

### The ICJ clarifies that armed attacks are distinguished by their scale and effects, but applying this test can be ambiguous.

> “The clearest enunciation of the threshold for an armed attack is found in the Nicaragua judgment where the ICJ first distinguished armed attacks as “the most grave forms of the use of force.”51 By itself, this dictum is far from conclusive, given that the use of force is also not an especially certain concept.52 The ICJ then gave arguably the most concrete judicial test for armed attacks when it stated that they may be distinguished from lesser uses of force (“mere frontier incident[s]”) by their “scale and effects.”53 This wording suggests that the armed force employed must be of a significant magnitude and intensity, perhaps best assessed based on the consequences that result.54 However, the precise application of this test remains unclear. For example, in a more recent case, the ICJ expressly refused to exclude from the scope of armed attack an action on as small a scale as the mining of a single military vessel.55” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 542)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:The Elements of a Right to Self-Defense

### Self-defense requires necessity and proportionality as per customary law.

> “As the ICJ has repeatedly emphasized, in addition to being a response to an armed attack, an act of self-defense is subject to meeting the elements of necessity and proportionality.56 These elements are not contained within the text of Article 51, but instead are determined entirely by customary law.57 An early but authoritative statement of these elements can be found in the diplomatic exchanges made in relation to the Caroline incident of 1837.58 In particular, then-U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster formulated necessity to require that the instigative events be “instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.”59 The effect of this requirement is that self-defense may only be undertaken when there is no realistic alternative.60” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 542)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:The Elements of a Right to Self-Defense

### Necessity in self-defense includes an aspect of immediacy, affecting the determination of its necessity.

> “Necessity includes an aspect of immediacy.61 While some scholars consider immediacy to be a separate element,62 a more common, and altogether more logical, view is that it is merely one consideration in a determination whether an act of self-defense is indeed necessary.63 Although the immediacy aspect has significance when considering necessity,64 a degree of flexibility is required when assessing whether a response is sufficiently prompt.65” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 543)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:The Elements of a Right to Self-Defense

### Proportionality in self-defense can be assessed qualitatively or functionally.

> “Webster also articulated the proportionality element to require that the response involve “nothing unreasonable or excessive.”66 Proportionality can be assessed one of two different ways. A qualitative view requires that the response be effectively equal in gravity with regards to casualties, damage, and the nature of the weapons employed.67 In general, however, a functional approach prevails wherein the focus is on employing a response of an appropriate scale to suitably repel the initial armed attack.68” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 543)

## Part II: Existing Principles of Jus Ad Bellum:B. The Right to Self-Defense:The Elements of a Right to Self-Defense

### The intent to harm the specific target may be an additional requirement for justifying self-defense.

> “Finally, arising out of the Oil Platforms case, a possible additional requirement for engaging in self-defense is that the armed attack be undertaken with the “specific intention of harming” the target that was ultimately attacked.69 In that case, the ICJ noted that the explosive mine laid could not have been targeted at the specific vessel struck but simply at some target in those general waters.70 As a result, it found the necessary intent to mount an armed attack lacking.71 One interpretation of this element, as expressed in the judgment, is that the state which suffered the injury must actually have been the intended target.72 The intention element is problematic as it requires the injured state to reliably infer what is essentially the state of mind of the attacking state.73 Despite the clear enunciation found in Oil Platforms, this element remains somewhat controversial, and has essentially been rejected by the United States.74” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 543)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law

### Victim states have legal and self-help options for responding to cyber-attacks.

> “This Part reviews the application of existing international law to cyber-attack. After suffering a cyber-attack, one option of a victim state is to respond through a legally oriented process that seeks to establish that the attack was a breach of international law and that the victim state is therefore entitled to reparations. Alternatively, the state may pursue some form of self-help, such as by responding in self-defense. The following Sections discuss these approaches in turn.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 544)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses

### State responses to cyberattacks through the UN face significant political obstacles.

> “Two processes of law by which a state may respond to a cyberattack exist through the United Nations.75 Article 39 of the Charter empowers the Security Council to “determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression” and then to respond through non-forcible or forceful measures.76 Additionally, Resolution 377(V), known as the Uniting for Peace Resolution, may provide some scope for a response by the General Assembly.77 However, the legal basis for this latter response is less certain and its scope far more constrained compared with action via the Security Council.78 In reality, the practical likelihood of either U.N. response following a cyber-attack appears relatively low.79 There are significant obstacles that stand in the way, and these are primarily political rather than legal.80 Therefore, these approaches are likely to remain largely theoretical in all but the most exceptional circumstances.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 544)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Cyber-attacks can breach international law by being classified as a use of force.

> “A more direct legal process that a victim state could pursue involves establishing that the cyber-attack was a breach of international law. States are limited in the ways they can characterize instances of cyber-aggression as a breach of international law. One such characterization is as a use of force in breach of the Charter.81 The question surrounding this characterization that has most occupied scholars is how to determine that a cyber-attack has exceeded the threshold necessary to be “force.”82” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 545)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Determining if a cyber-attack qualifies as a use of force is complicated due to the ambiguous definition of 'force'.

> “Unsurprisingly, this has proven to be a difficult question given that, even with regard to kinetic attacks, there is no conclusive definition of force.83 As discussed above, the origin of this problem is the instrument-based approach to the framing of Article 2(4).84 The prohibition in the instrument, rather than its consequences, is a layer of indirection, as the consequences are actually the relevant consideration.85 As Professor Michael Schmitt notes, the “normative shorthand” used within the Charter does not work because a connection no longer exists between the instrument (force) and the consequences the provision seeks to prevent.86” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 545)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Some scholars argue that cyber-attacks must cause physical damage to be considered a use of force.

> “Some scholars have advocated the simple test that a cyber-attack must result in physical damage to qualify as force.87 By far the most influential and highly regarded analysis, however, is that of Professor Schmitt.88 In his seminal 1999 paper, Schmitt outlined seven criteria to determine whether a given cyber-attack may constitute a use of force.89 These were recently adopted with relatively minor changes in the Tallinn Manual,90 a consensus statement on the law of cyber-warfare by twenty academics and legal practitioners.91 To the degree that any rules exist in this emerging area of law where there is no specific jurisprudence or clear state practice,92 Schmitt’s criteria on cyber-force are broadly accepted.93 The criteria proposed by Schmitt are: severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, presumptive legitimacy, and responsibility.94” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 546)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Professor Schmitt's seven criteria for assessing cyber-attacks as uses of force are widely acknowledged.

> “Severity relates to the degree to which attacks involve physical injury or the destruction of property.95 This is generally considered to be the most influential of the criteria.96 Immediacy draws a comparison between economic coercion, which is generally not regarded as a use of force, and armed coercion, which is, and suggests that the relative speed with which the latter takes effect may be used to determine if a cyber-attack represents a use of force.97 The criterion of directness operates similarly, observing that the consequences of armed coercion flow quite directly from the event itself, whereas the effects of economic coercion depend on multiple contributory and supervening external factors.98” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 546)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Severity, immediacy, and directness are key criteria in determining if a cyber-attack is a use of force.

> “Invasiveness distinguishes a use of force from economic coercion based upon whether the act associated with the harmful outcome occurs within the target state’s territory.99 Unlike armed force, economic coercion—such as the imposition of sanctions—does not require any territorial intrusion on the part of the coercive state.100 In his later analysis, Schmitt expands this notion to include the extent to which a target system is secured as a factor influencing the invasiveness of an attack.101 However, the fundamental connection with the encroachment of territory remains, as Schmitt juxtaposes this aspect with an example of trade sanctions being noninvasive.102 Further, he clarifies the limits of the invasiveness element by noting that espionage is not a use of force, despite its highly invasive nature.103” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 547)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Invasiveness of a cyber-attack is defined by whether harmful acts occur within the target state's territory.

> “Measurability involves the degree to which the consequences of an event can be ascertained, particularly in a quantitative way, which is largely a function of directness.104 The criterion of presumptive legitimacy recognizes that, in many cases, cyber-attacks will simply be computerized variants of existing attack methodologies.105 Schmitt argues that if computer technology is used to undertake some action that would previously not have been prohibited at international law, these computerized operations will also be legitimate.106 This view follows the general principle that, absent some express prohibition to the contrary, at international law an act will be presumed legitimate.107” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 547)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:1. Cyber-Attack as a Use of Force

### Measurability and presumptive legitimacy are crucial in evaluating the legality of cyber-attacks under international law.

> “The final criterion involves the notion that state responsibility can be a factor when evaluating cyber-attack as a use of force.108 The historically prevailing norm is that only states can exert armed coercion.109 Building on this, Schmitt reasons that the more closely involved a state is in a particular cyber-operation, the greater basis for other states to consider the act a use of force.110 In his original analysis, Schmitt dismissed this factor as a practical issue of limited normative value.111 However, Schmitt’s later work recognizes that state involvement in a particular action can have a normative effect beyond the question of attribution.112 The understanding of this seventh criterion was expanded further by the later recognition that there are actually two separate factors encompassed within it: the degree of state involvement in and the military nature of the cyber-operation.113 The Tallinn Manual adopts this more refined characterization of the responsibility criterion in Rule 11.114” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 548)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:2. Cyber-Attack as a Wrongful Intervention

### warfare may breach international law under the nonintervention principle.

> “An alternative theory for establishing a breach of international law involves treating acts of cyber-warfare as violations of the nonintervention principle.115 While not expressly stated in the Charter, this principle was described by the ICJ as “part and parcel of customary international law.”116 As enunciated by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case, the principle proscribes coercive intervention in matters that states should be free to decide by virtue of their sovereignty.117 For those who might question the Schmitt criteria or insist that a cyber-attack must cause physical damage to qualify as force, the principle of nonintervention represents an alternative limb on which to establish wrongfulness.118” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 548)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:2. Cyber-Attack as a Wrongful Intervention

### The threshold question for cyberforce is less significant if nonintervention can establish wrongfulness.

> “If the principle of nonintervention may be used to establish wrongfulness, arguably the threshold question in relation to cyberforce is of limited significance and may be essentially moot. This outcome is somewhat ironic given that the threshold for cyberforce is perhaps the area of cyber-attack law with the greatest clarity and consensus.119 Nonetheless, one may conclude that a cyberattack is likely to be a breach of international law under existing general rules without the need for the development of lex specialis in this area.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 548)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:A. Legally Oriented State Responses:2. Cyber-Attack as a Wrongful Intervention

### attacks may be easier to pursue than for kinetic attacks due to the nature of damages.

> “If a cyber-attack is found to have breached international law, a legal response may require that the responsible state “make full reparation for the injury caused.”120 Reparations are likely to be a comparatively appealing option for an injured state in response to a cyber-attack than they would be in relation to a kinetic attack. Cyber-attacks do not involve the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion generally found with kinetic attacks, thus reducing the importance of repelling an attack through selfdefense. Further, cyber-attacks are more likely than kinetic attacks to produce solely or predominately economic damage, making restitution of greater significance. However, in addition to the legal questions of threshold and attribution, seeking reparations will require the injured state to bring the matter before an appropriate tribunal that has both the jurisdiction to hear the case and the power to enforce its decisions. In the international arena, both issues are practically problematic.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Victim states can utilize lawful self-help in response to cyber-attacks.

> “As an alternative to pursuing a legal process in response to the cyber-attack, a victim state may instead employ a form of lawful self-help. That is, rather than becoming the basis for a legal claim, the internationally wrongful act may relieve the victim state of some of its international obligations.121 The most prominent form of self-help is that of self-defense,122 the primary focus of this Section. However, states may also employ countermeasures as a response to a cyber-attack.123” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Definitional ambiguity complicates the classification of cyber-armed attacks.

> “Although the properties of an armed attack have been discussed extensively by scholars, its precise nature remains uncertain even when considering kinetic attacks.124 Definitional ambiguity is far more problematic when considering an armed attack, because the motivation for and consequences of the legal analysis are different.125 When applied to cyber-armed attack, the threshold question only becomes less clear. Unlike a state that has been subject to illegal cyber-force, a state that seeks to establish itself as a victim of a cyber-armed attack very likely intends to respond forcefully in self-defense; otherwise there would be little point in seeking to establish the legal status of the attack with the higher threshold. The stakes in resolving the definitional ambiguity between cyberforce and cyber-armed attack are therefore considerably higher.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 549)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### The nature of armed attacks remains uncertain, particularly in cyberspace.

> “Although the properties of an armed attack have been discussed extensively by scholars, its precise nature remains uncertain even when considering kinetic attacks.124 Definitional ambiguity is far more problematic when considering an armed attack, because the motivation for and consequences of the legal analysis are different.125 When applied to cyber-armed attack, the threshold question only becomes less clear.

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Scholars lack consensus on the criteria for cyber-armed attacks.

> “In contrast to the broad acceptance of Schmitt’s criteria with respect to the use of force, there is no consensus regarding a test for cyber-armed attack.126 Schmitt has proposed that, to qualify as cyber-armed attack, an incident must result in physical damage,127 such as the destruction of data designed to be converted into tangible objects.128 This test does not assist in delineating the boundary between a use of cyber-force and cyber-armed attack; it is very similar to the test for armed force which Schmitt presents earlier in the same paper.129 Further, some academics view physical damage as the defining element of a use of cyber-force.130” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 550)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### A consequences-based model may help delineate cyber-armed attacks.

> “Another simple and relatively uncontroversial test advocated by cyber-policy specialist Herbert Lin and others extends the existing notion of cyber-armed attack to encompass cyber-incidents.131 That is, if the effects of a cyber-attack would be sufficient to qualify the attack as an armed attack if produced by kinetic means, then the cyber-incident will also qualify as a cyber-armed attack.132 Professor Yoram Dinstein argues that, “From a legal perspective, there is no reason to differentiate between kinetic and electronic means of attack . . . . The crux of the matter is not the medium at hand . . . but the violent consequences of the action taken.”133 Similarly, national security law expert Matthew Waxman suggests there is at least a U.S. consensus that a cyber-attack will be an armed attack where its “features and consequences” closely resemble those of traditional military force.134 This approach is essentially a continuation of the consequences-based model for interpreting rules framed in terms of the instrument employed.135 However, in their article on cyber-warfare, John Dever and James Dever reject this approach, arguing that existing concepts are inadequate to properly characterize the nuances of cyber-attack.136 Schmitt notes that opinion is divided as to the nature of cyber-armed attack, particularly where an incident does not cause physical damage but nonetheless produces severe outcomes.137 Emerging state practice suggests that the scope of armed attack in cyber-scenarios is likely to expand, although where these new boundaries will lie is far from clear.138” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 551)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Legal principles of necessity and proportionality in self-defense are complex.

> “The writings of scholars in this field suggest that the law in relation to the necessity and proportionality elements of self-defense as applied to cyber-attack is relatively straightforward and settled. For example, Dinstein’s analysis of this matter deals with necessity in a short paragraph, and is also brief when discussing proportionality.139 Similarly, Rule 14 of the Tallinn Manual hints at few controversies.140 However, these issues are not quite as straightforward as they might appear.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 551)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Necessity in cyber self-defense may be difficult to establish due to lack of physical incursion.

> “The writings of scholars in this field suggest that the law in relation to the necessity and proportionality elements of self-defense as applied to cyber-attack is relatively straightforward and settled. For example, Dinstein’s analysis of this matter deals with necessity in a short paragraph, and is also brief when discussing proportionality.139 Similarly, Rule 14 of the Tallinn Manual hints at few controversies.140 However, these issues are not quite as straightforward as they might appear.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 551)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### The immediacy of necessity complicates responses to cyber-attacks.

> “First, several issues emerge from the necessity element. The requirement of necessity implies that there is no alternative to a use of force to repel an attack that is either imminent or underway.141 On this basis, the general absence of physical territorial incursion in the case of cyber-attacks suggests that the necessity element may be fundamentally difficult to establish.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 551)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Proportionality in response to cyber-attacks raises additional concerns.

> “The immediacy aspect of necessity may also be particularly problematic in relation to computer attacks. For these attacks, many basic parameters that are normally readily apparent may remain unclear for some time. For example, the beginning or even the very existence of the attack may not be initially identifiable, as in the case of malware or direct intrusion.142 In other cases, denial of service attacks may occur intermittently, making it difficult to say whether these constitute a single attack and, if so, whether the attack is still ongoing. These properties significantly complicate the process of deciding when a response in self-defense would be sufficiently immediate and necessary. Obstacles to reliably ascertaining attribution and characterizing the type of attack may introduce further delays.143” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 552)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### The application of countermeasures in cyber-attacks is complex and nuanced.

> “Second, proportionality raises additional concerns. Proportionality limits the force employed to only what is necessary to successfully mount a defense in the circumstances.144 On this point, notably, scholars appear to be in general agreement that kinetic and cyber- uses of force are completely equivalent and interchangeable as defensive measures.145 Dinstein makes this claim as a blanket statement, providing neither supporting authorities nor logical argument.146 The expert authors of the Tallinn Manual also agree with this view: they repeat the claim several times in different contexts throughout the commentary on Rule 14.147” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 552)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Countermeasures must comply with international law's prerequisites.

> “While it is generally accepted that the proportionality requirement does not limit an injured state to a response that is qualitatively the same as that employed by the aggressor,148 it seems improbable and anomalous that the application of this functional model of proportionality to cyber-attack should be so simple and uncontentious. For instance, putting aside the questions of definition and attribution, if Iran had chosen to retaliate against Israel using kinetic force in response to the Stuxnet worm,149 the proportionality of this response would be regarded by certain sectors of the international community as at least contentious purely because Iran was the first to resort to kinetic weaponry. This is not to suggest that a state which is the victim of a serious cyber-armed attack should be precluded from employing kinetic force in defense. However, contrary to the apparent views of scholars, it seems likely in those circumstances that the proportionality of any response would be legally contentious.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 552)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### Countermeasures for cyber-attacks have specific legal requirements.

> “Finally, to assess the proportionality of any response, it is necessary to demarcate precisely what constitutes the initial cyber-armed attack. Dinstein suggests that the “accumulation of events” theory may apply to this problem.150 However, this theory is far from universally accepted by scholars,151 and has been rejected numerous times by the U.N. Security Council.152 Although the ICJ has seemingly accepted the notion that an accumulation of events can constitute an armed attack,153 the court has been more reluctant to conclude that an accumulation of events may be used when evaluating the proportionality of a given response.154 The relatively amorphous nature of cyber-attacks further complicates the task of analyzing the magnitude of an initial armed attack to determine a suitably proportionate response.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 553)

## Part III: Responses to Cyber-Attack Under International Law:B. Self-Help and Cyber-Self-Defense

### The technical nature of cyber-attacks complicates the application of countermeasures.

> “A key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals—even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks. Indeed, even attacks that intend or cause actual physical damage may be better remedied through reparation than self-defense. For example, it is unclear what form of response would constitute a meaningful act of selfdefense to an attack such as Stuxnet. By comparison, reparations in the form of restitution or compensation are likely to be far more satisfactory to the wronged state than a retaliatory response.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 554)

### Obstacles exist in understanding the application of countermeasures to cyber-attacks.

> “A key difference between instances of kinetic aggression and cyber-attack is the focus on immediate physical damage in relation to the former and the heightened significance of economic damage to the latter.155 Cyber-attacks can produce physical consequences, but so far these have been extremely rare.156 Therefore, many cyber-attacks are likely to produce primarily or exclusively economic damage.157 As noted, cyber-attacks lack the element of potentially escalating territorial incursion by military assets or personnel, diminishing the relevance of traditional state defense against such an incursion.158 As a result, in many cases reparations may be of more value to an injured state than reprisals—even assuming the existence of a clear legal framework for the application of self-defense to cyber-attacks.

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle

### Cyber-attribution poses significant legal challenges in responding to cyber-attacks.

> “The above Part summarizes some of the legal issues surrounding responses to cyber-attacks. However, arguably the most significant obstacle is that of cyber-attribution.172 This Part outlines the existing law of attribution and discusses why applying this law to cyber-attack is particularly problematic.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 556)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution

### Attribution is essential for a state's responsibility in international law regarding cyberattacks.

> “A state’s responsibility for a breach of international law is contingent upon the breach being attributable to that state.173 If an injured state wishes to seek reparations for the results of a cyberattack by another state, it will need to establish attribution. Alternatively, if the state intends to retaliate in self-defense, attribution is arguably even more important. A hypothetical scenario wherein one state could effectively “frame” another by routing cyber-attacks through systems based within the second state’s territory illustrates the importance of attribution and the dangers that cyber-misattribution poses.174 As will be discussed, misattribution is far more likely in relation to cyber-attacks than to traditional kinetic attacks.175” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 556)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### ARSIWA articles outline the rules of attribution for state actions.

> “ARSIWA Articles 4–11 outline the basic rules of attribution.176 Fundamentally, a state cannot act except through its agents.177 It is important not to cast the net too wide when delineating whose acts may be attributable to a state, however. Although actions of private individuals are generally not attributable to a state,178 ARSIWA Article 8 provides that private conduct will be attributable to a state if those persons act under instruction or the control of that state.179 The relative availability and cheapness of the technology necessary to mount a cyber-attack makes significant attacks launched by private individuals or corporations far more feasible compared with other types of warfare.180 The rules concerning attribution of the actions of nonstate actors are therefore of particular relevance to cyber-attack.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 556)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### The Nicaragua case established a standard of 'effective control' for attribution.

> “There are two possible standards for the degree of control required to establish attribution.181 In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ held that a state must have had “effective control” over the nonstate actor at the point where the alleged breaches occurred.182 In that case, the ICJ reasoned that general control was insufficient to impute responsibility for specific actions taken by paramilitary groups, even though these groups were at times completely dependent on U.S. support.183” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 557)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### The ICTY's overall control test expands state responsibility beyond the Nicaragua standard.

> “In contrast, in the case of Prosecutor v. Tadic ́, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) held that, where a hierarchically-organized group is under the “overall control” of a state, this will be sufficient to attribute the group’s actions to that state.184 Further, the ICTY indicated that the degree of control necessary may vary according to the facts of the case, such that not every case will require a high threshold.185 This is a much broader test than that articulated in Nicaragua, and potentially expands the scope of state responsibility significantly.186” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 557)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### Doubts surround the overall control test despite its academic relevance.

> “There is doubt concerning the overall control test as aspects of the ICTY’s dictum have been expressly and comprehensively rejected by the ICJ.187 Nonetheless, the overall control test is frequently referred to in the academic literature on attribution,188 and represents valuable jurisprudence when considering how the law of attribution could adapt to emerging issues such as cyberattack.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 557)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### Uncertainty exists regarding the standard of proof needed for establishing control.

> “Further enlarging the legal hurdle of attribution is the standard of proof required to establish this control. Historically there has been a degree of uncertainty regarding standards of proof required for matters brought before the ICJ.189 The ICJ is expressly required only to “satisfy itself . . . that . . . [a] claim is well founded in fact and law.”190 In Nicaragua, the ICJ referred to “convincing evidence”;191 however, this sheds little light on the required standard.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 558)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### The ICJ's judgments indicate the standard of proof varies with the seriousness of allegations.

> “Overall, the ICJ’s judgments suggest that the standard of proof will be commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation.192 This principle was enunciated in an early case where the ICJ required “decisive legal proof” and “conclusive evidence.”193 Much more recently the more relaxed standard of “balance of probabilities” was applied to a less weighty question concerning the location of a provincial boundary.194” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 558)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### The ICJ used a 'balance of evidence' standard in Oil Platforms, raising questions about its formal status.

> “Possibly contrary to such a principle, in Oil Platforms, the ICJ considered that attributing responsibility for the launch of a missile that had sunk a ship depended upon merely the “balance of evidence.”195 However, it is not clear whether this phrase was intended to express a formal legal standard of proof or merely described a general outcome that remained dependent upon the weight assigned to the evidence submitted.196” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 558)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:1. Legal Tests for Attribution

### Criticism of the ICJ's lack of clarity on proof standards led to more rigorous requirements in serious cases.

> “The apparent lack of a clear rule regarding the standard of proof required197 culminated in criticism that such a standard should be properly articulated to assist parties appearing before the ICJ.198 The ICJ responded by specifically addressing the question of standard of proof in the Bosnian Genocide case, restating the principle from Corfu Channel that “charges of exceptional gravity” require a high standard of proof, and expressly noting that this principle extends to attribution.199 Specifically, in Bosnian Genocide, the ICJ required that involvement with the crime of genocide be “established beyond any doubt.”200 Therefore, it seems that in the event of a serious cyber-attack, a victim state would likely be required to meet an exacting standard of proof.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 559)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:2. Bypassing Attribution

### States may be held indirectly responsible for private individuals' breaches of international law.

> “Further complicating the question of attribution, since the September 11 terrorist attacks, state practice appears to have expanded to incorporate an alternative notion of responsibility to that articulated in ARSIWA.201 Professor Vincent-Joe ̈l Proulx argues that states may be held indirectly responsible for the acts of private individuals that breach international law, even when there is no causal link between an action of the state and that breach.202 Although expressed in the context of terrorist attacks, in formulating his approach Proulx nonetheless appears to have contemplated the difficulties of applying traditional attribution where technology such as the Internet is involved.203” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 559)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:A. The Law of Attribution:2. Bypassing Attribution

### Proulx's indirect responsibility concept shifts the burden of proof to the accused host state.

> “Proulx’s notion of indirect responsibility is somewhat similar to vicarious responsibility,204 albeit somewhat broader, as indirect responsibility does not require the state to have knowledge of the unlawful activities occurring within its own borders.205 Essentially, Proulx’s proposition is one of strict liability that dispenses with the need to establish attribution. Instead, the accused host state bears the onus of demonstrating why it should not be liable.206” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 559)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### Legal attribution relies on technical identification of attack origins.

> “Legal attribution is entirely dependent on the ability to satisfactorily answer highly technical questions concerning the origin of a particular attack.207 Determination of the relationship between the attacker and responsible state is ultimately necessary. However, this is likely to first entail determination of the true geographic origin of an attack and the identity of those responsible.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 560)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### Establishing attack origins involves overcoming technical hurdles due to identity concealment.

> “Establishing these facts requires overcoming significant technical evidentiary hurdles. Attackers have at their disposal a variety of techniques to hide their identity and location, including use of various cryptographic mechanisms and routing their attacks through multiple compromised systems belonging to third parties.208 For example, the series of cyber-attacks on Estonia have been reported to originate from at least 177 countries, and as well from within Estonia itself.209” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 560)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### attackers operate in small, adaptable groups using easily acquired technology.

> “Given that cyber-attackers can work in comparatively small groups, or even as individuals, the means to establish their presence are very different from those where nonstate actors such as terrorists or insurgents establish a base in an unaffiliated host state. Further, quite unlike the weapons necessary to inflict traditional kinetic force, cyber-attackers require only commodity computer systems that can be easily, cheaply, and covertly acquired.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 560)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### Technical attribution challenges are unlikely to be resolved despite technological advancements.

> “Dinstein suggests the challenge of technical attribution is merely a temporary obstacle that will likely be overcome with inevitable technological improvement.210 However, most scholars expressly or impliedly reject this view. Some note that the architecture of the Internet makes identification inherently difficult.211 The very serious difficulty of technical attribution is widely acknowledged,212 and attribution is inherently the most significant practical obstacle to addressing cyber-attack under public international law.213 Indeed, some academics go as far as to suggest the problem of cyber-attribution may be impossible to solve.214” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 560)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### Defenders lag behind attackers in the ongoing Cyber arms race, complicating attribution.

> “Contrary to the minority view expressed by Dinstein,215 a solution is likely not a matter of waiting for technology to improve. In a sense, computer attackers and defenders are engaged in an arms race. However, the defenders will generally be at least one step behind. Attackers take the initiative in developing new mechanisms, which defenders must then identify, analyze, and defeat. These circumstances will generally favor the attacker, and a sufficiently well-resourced and motivated attacker can be expected to find ways to conceal their involvement and ultimate location.216 It may be that complete certainty as to the identity of the party responsible for a given attack will never be attainable.217” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 561)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:1. Technical Attribution

### Determining an attacker's identity hinges on proof standards, with political motivations influencing attribution.

> “Depending upon the standard of proof required, without some dramatic and fundamental change in the nature of the technology involved, such as the architecture of the Internet, ascertaining even the most basic facts as to the identity and origin of an attacker will probably remain at least very difficult. A high standard of proof is likely to make this task completely infeasible.218 If a lower standard applies, political motivation may be a more useful indicator of the origin of an attack than technical evidence.219 However, these difficulties raise the very real risk of one state covertly implicating another innocent state in an attack to damage relations or provoke conflict with the injured state.220” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 561)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:2. Legal Attribution

### Legal attribution is complicated by the challenges in establishing technical facts.

> “It follows from the extreme difficulty of establishing the basic facts surrounding technical attribution that establishing the facts to meet the requirements for legal attribution is even more problematic. Depending upon the standard required, proving the nuances of the relationship between the attacker and a state—the control exerted by the latter over the former at the relevant times—is likely to be extraordinarily difficult. A high standard of proof is likely to make this task impossible in most cases.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 561)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:2. Legal Attribution

### The ICJ's conservative standards may not effectively address the complexities of cyber attacks.

> “Thus, the ICJ’s conservative approaches in Nicaragua and Bosnian Genocide221 may simply be inappropriate when dealing with cyber attacks. To illustrate, one analysis of how existing attribution rules would apply to two publicly known cyber-attacks222 concluded that attribution could not be established for either under the effective control test, and would still be difficult using the overall control test.223” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 562)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:2. Legal Attribution

### Schmitt suggests a low standard for state responsibility regarding cyber attacks.

> “Schmitt has therefore advocated a low standard—an indirect responsibility approach whereby a state will be responsible if it fails to take reasonably available measures to stop cyber-attacks originating in its territory.224 He further suggests that, as long as a state takes reasonable steps to identify the perpetrator of a cyber-armed attack, it may respond forcefully in self-defense, and that it will not matter legally if the retaliating state turns out to be mistaken as long as it acted on the best available information.225” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 562)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:2. Legal Attribution

### Misattribution in cyber attacks could escalate conflicts between states.

> “Sklerov agrees, arguing that the situation should be judged on the facts at hand and, even if misattribution results, the injured state will have met its international obligations as long as it acts in good faith.226 Under this model, a state that does not comply with its international duty to prevent the use of its territory for cyberattack will have assumed the consequent risk.227 This is a dangerous approach that appears to lack a fundamental understanding of the nature of the threat posed by cyber-attack. All states would face extraordinary practical difficulties in ensuring that no computer system within their territory is ever used for purposes that may constitute a use of force or armed attack, either by an authorized user resident in that country or remotely by an unauthorized party operating extraterritorially. Such an approach would mean that two or more states could be easily and rapidly drawn into a cyberwar based on misattribution, with the ever-present risk of escalation to kinetic warfare.228” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 562)

## Part IV: The Attribution Obstacle:B. Problems with Cyber-Attribution:2. Legal Attribution

### Proulx's strict liability model could ease attribution burdens but risks wrongful accusations.

> “Although framed in relation to terrorism, rather than cyber-warfare, Proulx’s strict liability model could be applied to cyber-attack. By reversing the burden of proof, strict liability dispenses with attribution by requiring that the host state show that it has done what is reasonable in trying to prevent breaches perpetrated by those acting within their territory. Proulx argues that this approach incentivizes states to deal with problems within their own borders.229 However, setting a low standard for legal attribution, or discarding it entirely, risks the likelihood of an innocent state being wrongly implicated in an attack. This outcome would be particularly problematic if the incident rose to the level of an armed attack and the victim state had responded in self-defense.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 563)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Cyber-attack technicalities complicate attribution.

> “The technical properties of cyber-attack make attribution extremely problematic, to the extent that even identifying the ultimate location of the parties involved may be extraordinarily difficult.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 563)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Effective control test challenges state attribution.

> “The established effective control test sets an extremely high bar. Given the technical obstacles, generally proving that a set of cyberattackers were under the effective control of a state at the relevant time is likely impossible. The overall control test, while much broader in theory, may not lead to a different outcome in the case of cyber-attack.230 Further, the ICJ in Tadic ́ held that this test only applies where a group has a defined, hierarchical structure.231 The test is suited to quasi-military groups, but its application to small groups of hackers or individuals working in isolation is not clear. The rejection of this test by the ICJ also casts doubt on its legal validity.232” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 563)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Strict attribution standards hinder lawful state retaliation.

> “Both of these tests would likely present a serious obstacle to the ability of a state to take lawful retaliatory action in response to a cyber-attack. By establishing and upholding such a demanding test as effective control, the ICJ apparently seeks to limit when states can take such action. As a general question of policy, it would seem sensible to limit the opportunities for states to lawfully use force in response to the actions of private individuals. Such a principle applies similarly to retaliation due to cyber-attack, and is of particular importance where that response might include kinetic force. Consequently, the technical difficulties concerning attribution are in some respects an argument for maintaining the existing restrictive rules to avoid misdirected retaliation. While problematic, caution should therefore be exercised in contemplating whether to discard this high standard for attribution if there is the prospect of use of kinetic force.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 564)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### High standards for attribution complicate self-defense.

> “The practical application of the high standard for attribution to cyber-attack is hugely difficult; consequently, scholars argue that states ought to be able to exercise their inherent right to selfdefense in relation to a cyber-armed attack either based upon the best information available at the time or bypassing the need for attribution entirely.233 More cautious scholars note the tremendous risk of escalation and conflict inherent in permitting retaliatory action if strict attribution requirements are not maintained.234” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 564)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Grosswald critiques Proulx’s strict liability model.

> “Grosswald, for example, analyzes both the jurisprudence-based control tests and Proulx’s strict liability model in relation to cyberattack.235 He dismisses Proulx’s approach as clearly “untenable” in the context of cyber-self-defense due to the risk of misattribution.236 Further, while the notion of holding a state responsible for activities occurring within its borders may be suitable when dealing with large groups of terrorists or insurgents who have established bases and accumulated weapons, it is less applicable to small, agile, covert groups of cyber-attackers who require only a computer and network connection.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 564)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### States cannot feasibly control all computer usage.

> “It is neither practical nor desirable to require a state to monitor and control the use of every computer in its jurisdiction simply as a matter of course. Even states that enforce rigorous controls on Internet usage are not able to reliably prevent nontechnical users from accessing specific, easily identifiable websites.237 Sophisticated cyber-attackers working within a state’s territorial borders could easily do so undetectably, even with the kinds of very restrictive Internet controls that would be politically and culturally unpalatable in many countries.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 564)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Collaboration between states is essential but challenging for attribution.

> “Given the apparent infeasibility of establishing sufficient control and the dangers associated with strict liability, Grosswald argues that the obstacles to cyber-attribution should be resolved by encouraging cooperation and collaboration between states.238 However, Grosswald provides no real indication on how such an outcome could be achieved.239” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 565)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### High standards for attribution can lead to lawless cyber exchanges.

> “Both the high- and low-standard approaches are therefore problematic. The relative ease with which a state could be implicated in a cyber-attack supports Grosswald’s view that it is untenable to bypass the need to attribute responsibility for a cyber-armed attack before responding in self-defense.240 Further, establishing a presumption of state responsibility for failure to prevent detrimental activities within its borders seems ill-suited to cyber-attack as it would effectively hold the state to an impractically high standard. Dispensing with attribution in this context would lead to a high risk of serious conflict if the position of many scholars is adopted whereby cyber- and kinetic forces are regarded as entirely equivalent and interchangeable for the purposes of evaluating the proportionality of an action taken in self-defense.241” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 565)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Low attribution thresholds may provoke serious conflict.

> “On the other hand, requiring a high standard of attribution leads to problems of its own. The apparent unsuitability of the existing rules of international law has led to an effective practical lacuna. If a state cannot prove who is responsible for a cyber-attack it has suffered, retaliation in kind may be the safest option because the target of that retaliation will face similar obstacles. Consequently, the apparent inapplicability of existing rules arguably encourages states to engage in covert, effectively lawless, low-level cyber-exchanges. As this scenario may well produce serious conflict at some point, perpetuating it through impractically onerous requirements for state responsibility is not a sustainable position either.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 565)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:A. Summary of the Standard-for-Attribution Problem

### Attribution is unrealistic if states are involved.

> “On its face, Grosswald’s view that cyber-attribution can be resolved through “increased state collaboration and sharing of information”242 seems unrealistic. A state may well cooperate if its territory is unwittingly used to launch a cyber-attack in which it has no involvement. However, if the host state was involved in or supportive of the attack, genuine cooperation with the victim is implausible. In this scenario, the injured state depends upon the cooperation of the perpetrator to establish that party’s legal responsibility. Without such cooperation, establishing effective control to even a modest standard of proof is likely to be extremely difficult.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 566)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:B. Determining Attribution Requirements Based on State Response

### Correct mechanisms for cyber-attribution are crucial to prevent misdirected responses.

> “Employing the correct mechanism to establish cyber-attribution is of great importance. Getting the balance wrong may result in either increased likelihood of escalation of international tension and conflict caused by misdirected retaliation due to flawed attribution or, alternatively, rendering law-abiding states unable to respond to cyber-attack because legal attribution is impossible to establish.243 Attribution is a prerequisite to any lawful response, and this creates a practical lacuna whereby states are effectively precluded from any such response because of the infeasibility of cyber-attribution.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 566)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:B. Determining Attribution Requirements Based on State Response

### Attribution requirements should align with the victim state's chosen response to maintain legal integrity.

> “This Article proposes that these conflicting requirements can be resolved by determining attribution requirements based upon the course of action the victim state chooses to pursue. Grosswald correctly notes that circumventing attribution in the context of selfdefense would undermine the purpose of Article 51, and indeed one of the general goals of the Charter, namely to constrain the ability of states to lawfully use force.244 In the case of cyberdefense, therefore, the status quo should be maintained and states should continue to be required to meet a strict test—such as effective control—when making out attribution for the purposes of selfdefense. Irrespective of the general suitability of such a test in response to kinetic attacks,245 the uncertainty inherent in establishing cyber-attribution demands that the use of force in response is only permitted where there is a high degree of confidence that the force is directed at the correct target. This position is particularly important if cyber- and kinetic responses are considered entirely interchangeable when evaluating proportionality. If a low bar is set for attribution, catastrophic scenarios such as that discussed by Grosswald are plausible,246 and perhaps likely. The technical difficulties in attribution therefore support maintenance of strict rules to avoid misdirected retaliation.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 566)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:B. Determining Attribution Requirements Based on State Response

### Strict liability could enhance state collaboration in addressing cyber-attacks despite significant risks.

> “The above might suggest that strict liability is completely inapplicable to cyber-attack. However, this model still has a role to play. Grosswald’s hoped-for increased state collaboration seems idealistic, but is potentially achievable through strict liability. While the risks of strict liability in relation to attribution for self-defense are significant, reversing the burden of proof for attribution when a state seeks to address a breach of international law through legal processes would be a far more successful approach.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 567)

### Cooperation in resolving cyber-attack disputes can mitigate liability under strict liability regimes.

> “Under this model, it would then be in an accused host-state’s best interests to cooperate with the injured state to resolve the matter. Although cooperation in relation to cyber-attack scenarios is most likely to occur after the fact, that sequence is appropriate due to the speed at which cyber-attacks can take place, and also because of the difficulty a state is likely to have in ascertaining the existence of a cyber-threat within its territory prior to an incident. In the context of terrorism, Proulx notes that a host state which has sacrificed a degree of sovereignty by allowing foreign forces into its territory will be deemed to have significantly reduced its burden when mounting a defense against strict liability for the actions of private parties.247” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 567)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:B. Determining Attribution Requirements Based on State Response

### States pursuing peaceful resolutions for cyber-attacks may benefit from relaxed attribution standards.

> “Following this reasoning, when pursuing cyber-attacks as a wrongful act under a regime of strict liability, genuine cooperation by the host state in assisting the injured state to collect evidence might similarly discharge this obligation.248 Thus, states which pursue peaceful, legal processes for resolving disputes in relation to cyber-attacks should have the benefit of eschewing the stringent attribution tests normally required. Such a model encourages states to refrain from retaliation in self-defense, and instead pursue the matter through peaceful and measured legal processes. This approach is also likely to be preferred by cyber-attack victims where economic damage is far more prevalent than physical damage or territorial incursion.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 567)

## Part V: Resolving the Problem of Cyber-Attribution:B. Determining Attribution Requirements Based on State Response

### The proposed model for strict liability addresses current attribution challenges in cyber-attacks.

> “Conceptually, effective control concerns positive actions. That is, a state that has effective control over a group is actively involved with activities of that group. Conversely, strict liability is notionally more concerned with omissions. For example, a state that fails to act to prevent a group’s use of its territory as a launching pad for a terrorist attack might be held strictly liable for this omission. By instead determining attribution requirements based upon the victim state’s response, the proposed model dispenses with this distinction. The motivations for adoption of a new application of these concepts in the case of cyber-attack are the technical obstacles to establishment of attribution. Typically, strict liability seeks to avoid a circumstance where an injured party could not have done anything to protect itself. Under the proposed model, strict liability instead serves as a mechanism to elicit cooperation where, without it, a victim would be similarly defenseless, having no practical lawful recourse. Used in this way, strict liability seeks to resolve the scenario where the injured party otherwise could neither protect itself before the fact, nor receive justice after it. Application of strict liability in this way is a logical extension of these existing legal principles in relation to the emerging factual circumstances of cyber-attack.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 568)

## Conclusion

### The Article discusses the challenges of cyber-attribution and proposes a model linking it to state responses.

> “This Article has outlined some of the major legal issues in relation to cyber-attacks, focusing particularly on the question of attribution. The novel characteristics of cyber-attacks make the existing standards of proof and degrees of control required to establish attribution extremely difficult to determine. As a result, attribution is regarded by many scholars as one of the most significant and immediate practical obstacles to resolving the legal uncertainty surrounding this emerging issue.249 This Article has analyzed the different approaches to cyber-attribution and proposed a model whereby attribution requirements are linked with the state’s response to a cyber-incident. This approach leverages existing international law, discourages states from pursuing retaliatory responses, and incentivizes host states to assist the victims of cyber-attack in identifying the perpetrators. Issues remain regarding compulsory jurisdiction and enforcement of international tribunal decisions on these issues. Furthermore, the applicability of the law on countermeasures to cyber-attack requires further research. However, the approach described represents a viable way to address existing concerns regarding attribution. If the international community adopts this model and it proves successful, that may enable a greater focus on other impediments to effectively dealing with the problem of cyber-attack.” (Payne e Finlay, 2017, p. 568)
