# <h1>"At light speed": Attribution and response to cybercrime/terrorism/warfare</h1>

## Introduction

### The anonymity of cyber attacks complicates attribution to specific perpetrators.

> “The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult ...I. In October 2006, a "sensitive Commerce Department bureau"-the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)-suffered a "debilitating attack on its computer systems."2 The attack forced the BIS to disconnect its computers from the Internet, which interfered with its employees' ability to perform their duties. 3 It was traced to websites hosted by Chinese Internet service providers (ISPs), but the attackers were never identified.4” (Brenner, 2007, p. 3)

## Introduction

### Cybercriminals are often not identified due to the nature of online offenses.

> “Consider for a moment the statement: the attackers were never identified. This statement has several implications, the most obvious of which is that the individuals who carried out the attack were never identified. That is far from remarkable; given the opportunities cyberspace creates for the remote commission of attacks and attacker anonymity, it is more common than not for cybercriminals to go unidentified and unapprehended.5” (Brenner, 2007, p. 3)

## Introduction

### The nature of cyber attacks against the BIS remains unclear and could represent various forms of cyber malice.

> “That, though, assumes we are dealing with cybercriminals, which brings us to another implication of the statement above: Not only were the BIS attackers never identified, the natureof the attack was never identified. It was apparently clear the attack came from China,6 but what kind of attack was it? Was it cybercrime-the Chinese hackers launching a counting coup 7 on U.S. government computers? Was it cyberterrorism-an initial effort toward a takedown of U.S. government computers by terrorists (who may or may not have been Chinese) pursuing idiosyncratic ideological goals? Or was it cyberwarfare-a virtual sortie by People's Liberation Army hackers?8” (Brenner, 2007, p. 3)

## Introduction

### The BIS incident highlights the need for improved attribution and response strategies to cyber threats.

> “The BIS episode illustrates why we need to assess how we approach attribution (Who launched the attack? What kind of attack is it?) and the corresponding problem of response (Who should respond to an attackcivilian law enforcement, the military, or both?). As Sections II, III, and IV explain, the essentially ad hoc approaches we currently use for both attribution and response worked well in the past but are becoming increasingly unsatisfactory as cyberspace becomes a viable vector for attacks, of whatever type.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 4)

## Introduction

### The article aims to explore conceptual and legal issues related to ambiguous cyber attacks.

> “My goal in this Article is to explore these issues in terms of the conceptual and legal issues they raise. I will also analyze some nontraditional ways of structuring our response to ambiguous attacks, such as the one that targeted the BIS computers. My hope is that this Article provides a basis for further discussion of these issues, the complexity of which puts their ultimate resolution outside the scope or ambitions of any single law review article.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 4)

## Introduction

### The structure of the article includes a taxonomy of cyber threats and explores responses to them.

> “Section II constructs a taxonomy of cyberthreats (crime, terrorism, and war) and explains why these evolving threat categories can make who- and what-attribution problematic. Section III explains how these difficulties with attribution impact the process of responding to cyberthreats. Section IV continues our examination of this issue by analyzing how we might improve our response capability without surrendering principles we hold dear. Section V is a brief conclusion, which summarizes the preceding arguments and analysis and offers some final thoughts on both.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 4)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy

### Cyberthreats emerge from the blurring of crime and war due to technological advancements.

> “[T]he... "blurring of crime and war" at the operational level.... has accelerated over the last few decades.9 As Section I noted, the continuing evolution and proliferation of computer technology has created a new class of threats-"cyberthreats"which societies must confront. These cyberthreats can be generically defined as using computer technology to engage in activity that undermines a society's ability to maintain internal or external order.10” (Brenner, 2007, p. 4)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy

### Societies utilize a dual approach to maintain internal and external order through law enforcement and military forces.

> “Societies have historically used a two-pronged strategy to maintain the order they need to survive and prosper. Societies maintain internal order by articulating and enforcing a set of proscriptive rules (criminal law enforcement) that discourage the members of a society from preying upon each other in ways that undermine order, such as by killing, robbing, or committing arson.11" Societies maintain external order by relying on military force (war) and, to an increasing extent, international agreements.12" I call this the internal-external threat dichotomy, and the choice between law enforcement and military the attack-response dynamic.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 5)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy

### Computer technology disrupts traditional understandings of sovereignty and threat classification.

> “As we will see, computer technology erodes the empirical realities that generated and sustain this dichotomous approach to maintaining order. This approach is based on the assumption that each society occupies a territorially-defined physical locus-that, in other words, sovereignty and "country" are indistinguishable.13 One consequence of the presumptive isomorphism between sovereignty and territory is that threats to social order are easily identifiable as being either internal (crime/terrorism) or external (war). Computer-mediated communication erodes the validity of this binary decision tree by making territory increasingly irrelevant; as a study of cybercrime laws noted, "In the networked world, no island is an island."'14 In the twenty-first century, those bent on undermining a society's ability to maintain order can launch virtual attacks from almost anywhere in the world. As a result, these attacks may not fit neatly into the internal-external threat dichotomy and the attribution hierarchy (crime/terrorism, war) derived from that dichotomy.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 5)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy

### A taxonomy of cyberthreats is outlined and their impact on threat attribution processes is discussed.

> “Section II outlines a taxonomy of the three categories of cyberthreats: cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberwarfare. Section III explains how these online variations of real-world threat categories challenge the processes we currently use for threat attribution.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 5)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### Cybercrime requires a modified legal definition for effective global prosecution.

> “An online dictionary defines "cybercrime" as "a crime committed on a computer network."'15 The basic problem with this definition is that American lawyers need to be able to fit the concept of "cybercrime" into the specific legal framework used in the United States and into the more general legal framework that ties together legal systems around the world in their battle against cybercrime.16 That leads me to ask several questions: Is cybercrime different from regular crime? If so, how? If not, if cybercrime is merely a boutique version of crime, why do we need a new term for it? The first step in answering these questions is parsing out what cybercrime is and what it is not. When we do this, we see that the definition quoted above needs to be modified for two reasons.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 6)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### Many cybercrimes are traditional crimes committed through modern technologies.

> “The first reason is that this definition assumes every cybercrime constitutes nothing more than the commission of a traditional crime by nontraditional means (using a computer network instead of,say, a gun). As I have argued elsewhere,17 that is true for much of the cybercrime we have seen so far. For example, online fraud such as the 419 scam18 is nothing new as far as the law is concerned; it is simply "old wine in new bottles."19 Until the twentieth century, people had only two ways of defrauding others: they could do it face to face by offering to sell someone the Brooklyn Bridge for a very good price; or they could do the same thing by using snail mail.20 The proliferation of telephones in the twentieth century made it possible for scam artists to use the telephone to sell the bridge, again at a very good price.21 And we now see twenty-first century versions of the same scams migrating online.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 6)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### A wide range of traditional crimes is likely to migrate online.

> “The same is happening with other traditional crimes, such as theft, extortion, harassment, and trespassing.22 Indeed, it seems reasonable to believe that many, if not most, of the crimes with which we have traditionally dealt will migrate online in some fashion. Admittedly, a few traditional crimes-such as rape and bigamy-probably will not migrate online because the commission of these particular crimes requires physical activity that cannot occur online (unless, of course, we revise our definition of bigamy to encompass virtual bigamy).23” (Brenner, 2007, p. 7)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### Homicide via technology is conceivable, raising significant legal challenges.

> “The same cannot be said of homicide: while we have no documented cases in which computer technology was used to take human life, this scenario is certainly conceivable and will no doubt occur.24 Those who speculate on such things have postulated instances in which someone would hack into the database of a hospital and kill people by altering the dosage of their medication.25 The killer would no doubt find this a particularly clever way to commit murder because the crime might never be discovered. The deaths might well be put down to negligence on the part of hospital staff;26 and even if they were identified as homicide, it might be very difficult to determine which of the victims were the intended targets of the unknown killer and thereby begin the investigative process.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 7)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### Certain cybercrimes, like DDoS attacks, fall outside traditional definitions and require new legislation.

> “My point is that while most of the cybercrime we have seen to date is simply the commission of traditional crimes by new means, this will not be true of all cybercrime. We already have at least one completely new cybercrime: a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack overloads computer servers and "make[s] a computer resource [such as a website] unavailable to its intended users.27 In February 2000, a Canadian known as "Mafiaboy" launched attacks that effectively shut down websites operated by CNN, Yahoo!, Amazon.com, and eBay, among others.28” (Brenner, 2007, p. 7)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### DDoS attacks are increasingly used as a method of extortion, resembling historical crime tactics.

> “DDoS attacks are increasingly used for extortion.29 Someone launches an attack on a website, then stops the attack and explains to the website owner that the attack will continue unless and until the owner pays a sum for "protection" against such attacks.30 This is the commission of an old crime (extortion) by a new means, little different from tactics the Mafia used over half a century ago, though they relied on arson instead.31” (Brenner, 2007, p. 8)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### A 'pure' DDoS attack exemplifies a new category of cybercrime requiring specific legal frameworks.

> “But a "pure" DDoS attack, such as the 2000 attacks on Amazon.com and eBay, is not a traditional crime. It is not theft, fraud, extortion, vandalism, burglary, or any crime that was within a pre-twentieth century prosecutor's repertoire.32 It is an example of a new type of crime: a "pure" cybercrime.33 As such, it requires that we create new law that would make it a crime to launch such an attack.34” (Brenner, 2007, p. 8)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### The current definition of cybercrime inadequately encompasses new types of cybercrime.

> “To summarize, one reason why the definition quoted above is unsatisfactory is that it does not encompass the proposition that cybercrime can consist of committing "new" crimes--crimes we have not seen before and therefore have not outlawed-as well as "old" crimes. The other reason I take issue with this definition is that it links the commission of cybercrime with the use of a computer network.35” (Brenner, 2007, p. 8)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### networked technologies for traditional offenses.

> “Certainly, use of computer networks is usually true for cybercrime. In fact, it is probably the default model of cybercrime. But it is also possible that computer technology, not network technology, can be used for illegal purposes. A non-networked computer can, for example, be used to counterfeit currency or to forge documents.36 In either instance, a computer-but not a computer network-is being used to commit a crime. Here, the computer is being used to commit an "old" crime, but it is at least conceptually possible that a non-networked computer could be used to commit a "new" crime of some type.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 9)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### A comprehensive definition of cybercrime includes all uses of computer technology for illegal activities.

> “Thus, a better definition of cybercrime is the use of computer technology to commit crime; to engage in activity that threatens a society's ability to maintain internal order. This definition encompasses both traditional and emerging cybercrimes. It also encompasses any use of computer technology, not merely the use of networked computer technology.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 9)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:A. CYBERCRIME

### Legal responses to cybercrime need to be proactive in identifying and criminalizing new threats.

> “This generic definition does not, of course, provide the legal predicate needed to respond to cybercrime, as it is a conceptual definition of a category of crime rather than the definition of a particular offense or particular offenses. To ensure they can respond to new types of cybercrime, societies must monitor online activity in an effort to identity emerging activities that constitute a threat to their ability to maintain internal order. Once identified, these activities should be criminalized, just as the United Kingdom recently criminalized DDoS attacks.37” (Brenner, 2007, p. 9)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### Cyberterrorism involves the use of computer technology for terrorist activities.

> “[G]et ready .... terrorists are preparing ... cyberspace based attacks ....38 Generically, cyberterrorism consists of using computer technology to engage in terrorist activity.39 This definition mirrors the generic definition of cybercrime articulated in the previous section, which is appropriate given that societies treat terrorism as a type of crime. However, societies conflate crime and terrorism because both threaten their ability to maintain internal order. The assumption, which derives from the dichotomy noted earlier, is that all threats to internal order should be dealt with in the same way.40” (Brenner, 2007, p. 9)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### Distinguishing between crime and terrorism is essential for societal responses.

> “Although societies conflate crime and terrorism, we need to distinguish them because they differ in ways that are relevant to how societies need to respond to them. Basically, crime is personal while terrorism is political.41 Crimes are committed for individual and personal reasons, the most important of which are personal gain and the desire or need to harm others psychologically and/or physically.42” (Brenner, 2007, p. 10)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### Terrorism inflicts harm for political reasons, differing from crime's individual motivations.

> “Terrorism often results in the infliction of harms indistinguishable from those caused by certain types of crime (such as death, personal injury, or property destruction), but the harms are inflicted for very different reasons.43 A federal statute, for example, defines "terrorism" as committing acts constituting crimes under the law of any country to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence government policy by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.44 We will return to the issue of terrorism-ascrime in a moment, but first we need to focus on what precisely is involved in the commission of terrorist acts.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 10)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### Terrorism seeks to demoralize civilians, contrasting with the aims of warfare.

> “As the above definition suggests, terrorism is usually intended to directly or indirectly demoralize a civilian population;45 this distinguishes terrorism from warfare, which is not supposed to target civilians.46 In the real-world, terrorism usually achieves its primary goal47 of demoralizing civilians by destroying property and injuring or killing civilians.48 The 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center are a perfect example of real-world “terrorism; they were intended to destroy a premier symbol of capitalism and in so doing undermine the morale of U.S. citizens and the stability of the U.S. society.49” (Brenner, 2007, p. 12)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### No verified instances of cyberterrorism have occurred; past cases are misclassified.

> “To date, there have been no known instances of cyberterrorism.50 There have been cases which media has incorrectly described as cyberterrorism: in 2000, an Australian man hacked into a municipal wastemanagement system and dumped "millions of litres of raw sewage" into parks, rivers, and businesses.51 Elsewhere, in 1997 a Massachusetts hacker shut down all communications to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) control tower at an airport for six hours.52 These and similar cases, however, involved cybercrime, not cyberterrorism. In each instance, the perpetrator acted out of individual motivations-a desire for revenge or power-instead of out of a desire to advance a particular ideology by demoralizing segments of a civilian population.53” (Brenner, 2007, p. 12)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM

### Understanding cyberterrorism requires analyzing technology as a tool for demoralization.

> “To understand what cyberterrorism can and will be, we must parse out how terrorists can use computer technology to demoralize a civilian population and thereby undermine a society's ability to sustain internal order.54 Conceptually, computer technology's use for this purpose falls into three categories: (1) weapon of mass destruction; (2) weapon of mass distraction; and (3) weapon of mass disruption.55 I now examine each, in order.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 13)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:1. Weapon of Mass Destruction

### Computer technology cannot independently inflict physical damage.

> “This is a conceptual option, but not a real possibility. The notion that computer technology can be a weapon of mass destruction is based on a flawed premise: the concept that computers, alone, can be used to inflict the kind of demoralizing carnage the world saw in New York and Washington, D.C., on 9/11 or in Madrid on 3/11.56 Computers, as such, cannot inflict physical damage on persons or property; that is the province of real-world implements of death and destruction.57” (Brenner, 2007, p. 13)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:1. Weapon of Mass Destruction

### Computers can be used to enable catastrophic physical damage in cyberterrorism scenarios.

> “However, computers can be used to set in motion forces that produce physical damage. Instead of hacking into a municipal waste-management system for revenge, cyberterrorists could disable the systems that control a nuclear power plant and cause an explosion like the one at Chernobyl in 1986.58 By claiming responsibility for the catastrophe, the cyberterrorists could exploit the resulting illness, death, and radioactive contamination to undermine citizens' faith in their government's ability to protect them and maintain order.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 14)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:1. Weapon of Mass Destruction

### Using computers to trigger explosions does not qualify as cyberterrorism.

> This is a viable terrorism scenario, but it is not a cyberterrorism scenario. While computer technology would be used to trigger the explosion, the victims would recall it as a nuclear catastrophe, not as a computer catastrophe. Here, as in other computer as weapon of mass destruction scenarios, computer technology plays an incidental role in the commission of a terrorist act, serving merely as a detonator. To describe this scenario as cyberterrorism is as inappropriate as describing the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings carried out by Al-Qaeda as automotive-terrorism  because vehicles were used to deliver the bombs to the target sites.59

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:2. Weapon of Mass Distraction

### Cyberterrorism employs technology for psychological manipulation.

> “This is both a conceptual and a realistic possibility. Here, computer technology plays a pivotal role in the commission of a terrorist act, an act that differs in essential ways from the real-world terrorism to which we are accustomed. Computer technology is used to manipulate a civilian population psychologically. This manipulation saps civilian morale by undermining citizens' faith in the efficacy of their government.60 Depending on the type of manipulation involved, it can also result in the infliction of personal injury, death, and property destruction.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 14)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:2. Weapon of Mass Distraction

### A hypothetical scenario demonstrates psychological manipulation during a crisis.

> “To understand how computer technology could be used purely for psychological manipulation, consider this scenario: on September 11, 2001, as planes crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, millions of Americans watched the events unfold on television; many also used the Internet to try to find out more about what was happening.61 The CNN site experienced particularly heavy traffic that day.62 What if, instead of finding CNN-generated content, these visitors had encountered a Web page that announced, in appropriately terrifying graphics, "World War-Nuclear Holocaust in Europe and Australia, Japan Devastated by Chemical Attack"?63” (Brenner, 2007, p. 15)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:2. Weapon of Mass Distraction

### A fabricated online threat could amplify real-world terror effects.

> “As this was 2001, an over-the-top Orson Welles "War of the Worlds" reaction would have been unlikely,64 since for the last decade, people typically have been obtaining their news from several types of media and from various sources within each type. But the posting of such a falsified page could have acted as a terror multiplier, enhancing the unnerving effects of the day's real-world terrorist events.65 It could also have left lingering doubts in the public's mind as to whether "the government" had actually "covered up" the extraterritorial disasters once reported on CNN. These doubts could have provided the predicate for a long-term campaign of eroding public confidence in public officials and news outlets.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 15)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:2. Weapon of Mass Distraction

### Fake emergency alerts can cause chaos and diminish public trust.

> “Now consider a scenario coupling psychological manipulation with injury, even death. At 1:00 p.m. on a Wednesday in San Francisco, the local Office of Emergency Services and Homeland Security receives messages via a secure government computer system informing them that a "suitcase nuclear device" is on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, the public transportation system that serves San Francisco and surrounding cities.66 The officials are told the device is in the hands of terrorists who will detonate it in two hours, at 3:00 p.m. If such a device were detonated, the death and destruction would be unimaginable-far greater than that inflicted on 9/11. The officials issue an immediate evacuation order for the San Francisco area. This produces chaos as panicked citizens desperately try to flee an impending nuclear disaster: cars clog the streets and accidents ensue, while those without cars clamor for other means of public transportation, leading to stampedes. Death, injury and property damage result-except that there is no impending disaster, no suitcase nuke. Terrorists hacked the government computer system and sent credible, fake messages, which the local officials reasonably believed. The net result is that the terrorists could achieve injury, death, and destruction as well as a dramatic erosion in the public's confidence in the government's ability to ensure their security without having to deploy an actual weapon.67” (Brenner, 2007, p. 15)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:2. Weapon of Mass Distraction

### Cyber tactics focus on psychological impacts rather than physical harm.

> “In these and other computer as weapon of mass distraction scenarios, computer technology is used primarily for psychological manipulation. The first scenario is a "true" computer as weapon of mass distraction scenario; the second. scenario tends to blend weapon of mass distraction with hypothesized weapon of mass disruption effects. The point, though, is that neither scenario involves the actual use of real-world weapons; the computer is the only implement the terrorists employ.”

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:3. Weapon of Mass Disruption

### Terrorists use technology to disrupt public confidence in essential services.

> “When terrorists use computer technology as a weapon of mass disruption, their goal is to undermine a civilian populace's faith in the stability and reliability of essential infrastructure components such as mass transit, power supplies, communications, financial institutions, and health care services.68 Although the weapon of mass disruption and weapon of mass distraction alternatives both target civilians' faith in essential aspects of their society, they differ in how computer technology is used to corrode civilian confidence in societal infrastructure and services.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 16)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:3. Weapon of Mass Disruption

### Cyberterrorists aim to inflict psychological harm by manipulating perceptions.

> “As we saw in the previous section, terrorists launch a psychological attack when they use computer technology as a weapon of mass distraction; the goal is to undermine civilians' confidence in one or more of the systems they rely on for essential goods or services. The cyberterrorists accomplish this by making citizens believe a system has been compromised and is no longer functioning effectively. The terrorists do not actually impair the functioning of the system. Their goal is to inflict psychological, not systemic, damage.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 16)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:3. Weapon of Mass Disruption

### Cyberterrorism can cause systemic damage to essential infrastructures.

> “However, when computer technology is used as a weapon of mass disruption, terrorists' goal is the infliction of systemic damage on one or more target systems. This version of cyberterrorism is closer to the scenarios that sometimes appear in the popular media in which cyberterrorists shut down an electrical grid or the systems supplying natural gas or petroleum to a particular populace.69” (Brenner, 2007, p. 16)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:3. Weapon of Mass Disruption

### Cyber terrorism aims to undermine societal trust without causing catastrophic destruction.

> “Like the weapon of mass distraction alternative, this scenario is a conceptual yet realistic possibility. Here, terrorists utilize computer technology in a fashion that is analogous to, but less devastating than, their utilization of real-world weapons of mass destruction. Their goal is not to inflict the catastrophic carnage and destruction we saw on 9/11.70 Rather, it is more insidious: to demoralize a civilian populace by making civilians question the government's ability to keep things working. In other words, terrorists seek to undermine citizens' faith in their government's ability to maintain the essential fabric of their lives by ensuring that the systems on which they rely function as they are intended to.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 17)

### Urbanization increases vulnerability to infrastructure attacks.

> “As many have noted, our increasingly urbanized, increasingly technologized lifestyle makes us more vulnerable to this type of terrorism than traditional, rural societies: The key to unlocking the disruptive potential of cities ... is to attack key points ... within target infrastructure ... to force a change in the city's dynamic. Infrastructure attacks, particularly on power/fuel/water, negate the ability of the government to deliver political goods .... This halts economic activity and ... damages the ability of the government to deliver political goods, which are the key to legitimacy.71” (Brenner, 2007, p. 17)

### Modern cities can be destabilized by targeting key infrastructure.

> “In this excerpt, the author is assuming attacks of a more drastic character, such as those inflicted in war.72 He cites contemporary Baghdad as an example of how cities can be engineered to radiate instability .... This is accomplished through acts that leverage three attributes of modern cities. These include:  Extreme mobility and interconnectedness (for example, high rates of automobile and cell phone ownership). " Complete reliance on high volume infrastructure networks. " Complex and heterogeneous social networks that are held together under  pressure.73” (Brenner, 2007, p. 17)

### Cyberterrorist simulations reveal vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure.

> “The same effect can be achieved, less dramatically, with cyberterrorist attacks that disrupt the functioning of infrastructure components. A recent exercise conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security demonstrates this. In February 2006, more than three hundred participants from the American public and private sectors and from four other countries conducted a simulated cyberterrorism assault, called Cyber Storm, on U.S. government agencies and businesses.74 The attacks were meant to disrupt "critical infrastructure,... leading to cascading effects" within the participating countries' "economic, societal, and governmental structures.75 The exercise revealed problems in coordination between the public and private sectors and between different agencies in the public sectors. It also showed that talented, determined attackers can inflict serious damage on components of the United States' infrastructure.76” (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)

### Agency coordination during attacks is crucial for effective response.

> “The Cyber Storm attacks were launched by a loosely knit coalition of domestic terrorists and opportunistic attackers, including a "cyber saboteur," a disgruntled airport employee, and German hackers.77 Among other things, the disparate attackers crashed the FAA computer control system, caused electrical power and Internet outages, shut off the heat in government buildings, compromised medical data, posted a false Amber alert, altered one "No Fly" list and posted another one online, shut down commuter trains, and altered account balances in financial institutions.78” (Brenner, 2007, p. 18)

### Cyber Storm simulated attacks demonstrated potential for serious infrastructure disruptions.

> “Cyber Storm was intended to test how collaborating government agencies and private sector representatives would respond to cyberattacks.79 The exercise demonstrated that these cyberattacks can be launched with a fair degree of efficacy.80 The Cyber Storm report noted that while the "good guy" players were "generally effective in addressing single threats/attacks ..... [p]layers were challenged when attempting to develop an integrated situational awareness picture and cohesive impact assessment across sectors and attack vectors."81' It also noted that improved "processes, tools and technology" would "enhance the quality, speed and coordination of response," particularly for "cascading attacks or consequences.82 The Cyber Storm report at least implicitly indicates that improvements are needed in interagency (and inter-sector) coordination, contingency planning, risk assessment, and definition of "roles and responsibilities across the entire cyber incident response community.,83” (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)

### Localized cyberattacks can generate fear and demonstrate animosity to government control.

> “The effects of the Cyber Storm attacks were localized and somewhat limited because the goal of the exercise was to test responses, not to explore how cyberattacks can demoralize civilians.84 Still, shutting down FAA systems, commuter trains, electrical power, Internet access, and heat would unnerve the victim populace. Arguably, one of the most effective ways to mount a weapon of mass disruption attack would be to structure outages or other interferences of essential services in a way that dramatically demonstrates that these systems are now under the control of some anonymous, hostile agency.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 19)

### Synchronized attacks on minor cities could create widespread insecurity.

> “One way to do this would be to launch sequenced, synchronized attacks shutting down ATMs and other financial systems in carefully selected U.S. cities.85 They should be minor cities, perhaps Des Moines, Ithaca, Tulsa, Lexington, Eugene, and Fresno. The reason for this is that we are more likely to expect terrorist attacks on major cities. The bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building was especially horrific because until then, we had not expected catastrophes in the Heartland. Many still do not.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 20)

### Attacks targeting financial systems could undermine public trust similar to past disasters.

> “As the financial system attacks progressed from city to city, it would become increasingly apparent they were neither random, nor the product of software bugs, nor otherwise explainable, but were instead the product of terrorist activity. While attacks such as these would not inflict the sheer horror of the 9/11 attacks, they could further terrorist goals by creating a climate of insecurity and anger at the government, something analogous to what we saw with the Hurricane Katrina fiasco. The negative effects could be magnified if the attacks were sporadically repeated in other cities or if they were coupled with similar attacks on other non-financial systems, such as electrical power, telephone' communication, or air traffic control.86” (Brenner, 2007, p. 20)

### Healthcare systems are also vulnerable to cyberattacks, potentially causing harm.

> “Another kind of attack might target health care systems. We have already seen an inadvertent example of this. In 2005, a botnet, a network of compromised computers,87 controlled by Christopher Maxwell attacked a Seattle hospital.88 The botnet shut down computers in the Intensive Care Unit and caused operating room doors and doctors' pagers not to function.89 Maxwell did not intend for his botnet to attack Seattle's Northwest Hospital or any other hospital; rather, he was using it to earn commissions for surreptitiously installing adware on users' computers. 90 The attack, if such it was, occurred because the botnet was searching for computers to add to its system; in so doing, it overloaded the hospital's computer systems and shut down various functions.91Because the attack was inadvertent, its effects were not as serious as they would have been had there been a sustained attack. Hospital staff was therefore able to improvise solutions that prevented patients from being harmed and ensured uninterrupted quality patient care.92” (Brenner, 2007, p. 20)

### The Seattle hospital incident illustrates the potential for cyberattacks to cause personal harm.

> “As the Seattle episode illustrates, weapon of mass disruption attacks can cause personal injury or even death (along with property damage).93 They can also be, but are not necessarily, blended attacks, which combine the infliction of real harms with psychological manipulation.94” (Brenner, 2007, p. 21)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:4. Cyberterrorism as Crime

### Terrorism is defined as a crime and is legally prosecuted globally.

> “Having analyzed how terrorists can use computer technology to advance their primary goals of demoralizing civilians and destabilizing governments, by logical extension, it is fair to define terrorism as a crime rather than as war. Terrorism is defined and prosecuted as a crime in the U.S. and elsewhere.95 A federal statute makes terrorism a federal crime in the United States. 96 Other countries criminalize terrorism, and both the United Nations and the European Union have defined terrorism in a criminal context.97 kill, injure, and kidnap people and destroy property. The activity is the same as that conducted by criminals-only the motivation differs.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 22)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:4. Cyberterrorism as Crime

### The treatment of terrorism as a crime is influenced by its often domestic nature.

> “The practice of treating terrorism as crime no doubt evolved for two reasons. First, terrorists historically tended to be home-grown; they might, like the first-century Zealots or eleventh-century Hashhashin, target foreigners in their own country, but they were still a local, domestic threat.98 Second, their efforts generally target a society's ability to maintain order in the face of internal threats, and the activities in which they engage are functionally indistinguishable from many crimes.99 Real-world terrorists” (Brenner, 2007, p. 21)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:4. Cyberterrorism as Crime

### Cyberterrorism should be treated as crime despite its potential remote execution.

> “It seems reasonable to continue this approach of treating cyberterrorists as criminals, even though cyberterrorism, unlike most traditional, real-world terrorism, can be committed remotely.100 For example, in the Cyber Storm exercise, three hackers operating from Germany contributed to the disruption of services in the United States.101 One might argue that this remote commission capacity warrants treating cyberterrorism differently-approaching it as an external, rather than an internal, threat to social order. To do that, we would have to define "remote" cyberterrorism as something other than crime. 102 Alternatively, we could expand our definition of crime to encompass at least one type of external threat. 103” (Brenner, 2007, p. 22)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:4. Cyberterrorism as Crime

### Remote commission of cybercrime does not alter its classification as crime.

> “As I noted earlier, cybercrime can also be committed remotely. This has certain consequences for how we approach the investigation and apprehension of those who commit cybercrime,104 but for "mere" cybercrime, the capacity to act remotely is clearly irrelevant to the inherent nature of the phenomenon itself. Theft is theft, fraud is fraud, and extortion is extortion, regardless of whether they are committed by the victim's nextdoor neighbor or by someone halfway around the world. The same is true for the other categories of harm-infliction we define as crime. As long as the remote (or local) perpetrator acts out of personal motives, the dynamic is that of crime-the victimization of one individual by another.105 Therefore, instead of focusing on means (how harm is inflicted), we focus on the harm itself, because it is the infliction of these types of harm (criminal harms) that threatens internal order.106” (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:B. CYBERTERRORISM:4. Cyberterrorism as Crime

### Terrorism undermines societal order and should be viewed as indistinguishable from crime.

> “The same should be true for terrorism. Insofar as terrorist acts are designed to undermine a society's ability to maintain internal order, they are indistinguishable from, and should be treated as, crime regardless of whether they are perpetrated locally or remotely.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)

### The distinction between crime and cybercrime complicates when state agency is involved.

> “Before we conclude this discussion, I need to make one caveat: the approach I outline above is satisfactory when the only factor differentiating crime or terrorism from cybercrime or cyberterrorism is local versus remote commission. Indeed, as the next section explains, the analysis can become more complex when crimes or terrorist acts are carried out in Nation-State A by individuals who are acting as agents of Nation-State B.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 23)

### Cyberwarfare involves nation-states using cyberspace for military advantages.

> “Cyberwarfare is the conduct of military operations by virtual means.110 It consists of nation-states' using cyberspace to achieve the same ends that they pursue through the use of conventional military force: achieving advantages over a competing nation-state or preventing a competing nationstate from achieving advantages over them.111'” (Brenner, 2007, p. 24)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:C. CYBERWARFARE

### Warfare is conducted by individuals on behalf of nation-states.

> “As noted above, the distinguishing characteristic of war is that it is a struggle between nation-states;"114 war-like all human activity-is carried out by individuals, but here individuals act on behalf of a particular nationstate.115 Like terrorism, warfare tends to result in the destruction of property (often on a massive scale) and in the injury and deaths of individuals (also often on a massive scale)."116 Unlike terrorism, war is limited, at least in theory, to clashes between the aggregations of individuals (armies), who respectively act for the warring nation-states.117 Injuring and killing civilians occurs, but like most property damage and destruction, it is a collateral event.118 The primary focus of war in general and of particular wars is to "triumph" over the adversarial nation-state(s), whatever that means in a given context.119” (Brenner, 2007, p. 26)

### War is clearly defined and unambiguous compared to crime or terrorism.

> “In the real-world, there can be ambiguity as to whether an event is a crime or an act of terrorism, 120 but war is always unambiguous. 12 1 When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941,122 it was clearly an act of war; the same was true when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and has been true throughout recorded history.123” (Brenner, 2007, p. 26)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:C. CYBERWARFARE

### Nation-states uniquely possess the means for conducting physical warfare.

> “War is unambiguous in the real-world because it is unique; only nation-states can summon the resources needed to launch a physical land, sea, or air attack on another nation-state. The clarity of war is further enhanced by the fact that those who conduct an attack wear uniform clothing and insignia that identify them as members of a particular nation state's armed forces.124 And, of course, real-world warfare involves the violation of territorial boundaries. Nation-states are defined by the territory they control;125 acts of war have, as a result, historically involved breaching the integrity of the victim state's borders.126 This, after all, is why war is a nation-state's response to an external threat-though not the only possible response. The threat to social order comes not from "insiders" who are at least ostensibly legitimately in the state's territorial boundaries but from another nation-state-a necessary externality.127” (Brenner, 2007, p. 27)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:C. CYBERWARFARE

### Internal and external threats are distinguished by the nature of the attacker.

> “The threat dichotomy (internal versus external threat, crime and terrorism versus war) we reviewed earlier is consequently a stable, reliable way of parsing real-world attacks. We may be somewhat uncertain as to whether a particular event is crime or terrorism, but that is ultimately of little moment because we use the same approach for both, since both threaten internal order. And the monopolization of territory and military force by nation-states means that in the real-world, we will never be uncertain as to whether we are confronted with a threat to internal order (crime/terrorism) or a threat to our nation-state's ability to maintain external order (war).128 In the real-world, only nation-states wage war.129” (Brenner, 2007, p. 27)

## Identifying Cybercrime, Cyberterrorism, and Cyberwarfare: Taxonomy:C. CYBERWARFARE

### Cyberspace allows non-state actors to challenge the traditional monopoly of warfare held by states.

> “As the scenario we began with implicitly illustrates, this threat dichotomy breaks down when attacks are vectored through the virtual world. By giving non-state actors access to a new, diffuse kind of power,130 cyberspace ends nation-states' monopolization of the ability to wage war and effectively levels the playing field between all actors. 131 In the twenty first century, states generate crime and terrorism as well as war, and individuals wage war in addition to committing crimes and carrying out acts of terrorism. I examine these issues next.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 28)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:

### Attribution involves distinguishing between who committed an attack and how to respond.

> “For our purposes, attribution encompasses two issues:132 who carried out an attack, and what kind of an attack it was. The first issue goes to assigning responsibility for committing an attack. The second goes to assigning responsibility for responding to an attack. We will call the first "attacker-attribution" and the second "attack-attribution." The sections below examine how we currently approach both. Section IV then considers how we can improve our approach to what is becoming the most problematic aspect of attribution: attack response.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 28)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION

### Identifying attackers is crucial for responding to cyber attacks.

> “The task of identifying those who are responsible for an attack has been, and will remain, a constant. As we will see, identification of the attacker can play an integral role in ascertaining the nature of an attack; and ascertaining the nature of an attack is usually the first step in formulating a response to an attack, of whatever type.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 28)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION

### Attacker attribution analysis will be divided into two stages.

> “We will divide our consideration of attacker-attribution into two stages. First, we review how attacker-attribution is currently approached for real-world attacks. Second, we will consider how attacker-attribution becomes problematic as attacks migrate online, in whole or in part.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 29)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:1. Real-worldAttribution

### Attributing Acts of War Is Generally Easier Than Identifying Criminal Acts

> “Attacker-attribution has historically been less problematic for war than for crime or terrorism.133 The laws of war require states launching an attack on another state to identify themselves, though this convention is apparently honored more in the breach than in its realization.134 Even if that is true, it is generally not difficult to identify the state responsible for an act of war in the real-world. The initial attack may be a surprise, as with Pearl Harbor, but attributing the attack to a specific state tends to be a relatively simple process. Military attackers wear distinctive, uniform clothing and use equipment with insignias or characteristics indicating their national affiliation. The language the attackers use will be another indicator of their country of origin, as well as circumstances of the attack itself.135 The location from which an attack is launched can be another clue: if NationState A is under attack by missiles being launched from Nation-State B, Nation-State A's decision-makers can reliably infer that either Nation-State B, or another nation with which Nation-State B is affiliated (Nation-State C, say) is responsible for the attack.136” (Brenner, 2007, p. 29)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:1. Real-worldAttribution

### Criminals Actively Avoid Identification to Prevent Apprehension

> “Identifying those responsible for a crime is usually much more difficult. Criminals have a strong incentive to avoid identification because it is generally the first step to being apprehended, tried, convicted, and sanctioned for their misdeeds.137 With rare exceptions,138 criminals do not intentionally identify themselves as the architects of their crimes (though they may do so indirectly by using a nom de crime, such as "the Zodiac Killer").139 Since crime control is essential for the maintenance of internal order, nation-states have developed a standardized, generally effective approach for identifying those who commit crimes in their territory.140” (Brenner, 2007, p. 30)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:1. Real-worldAttribution

### Traditional Criminal Investigations Rely on Physical Evidence and Localized Assumptions

> “This criminal investigation approach assumes activity in the real-world because, until recently, physical reality was the only arena of crime commission.141 The approach therefore focuses on finding attribution evidence at a physical crime scene by locating witnesses who saw the perpetrator and can describe and hopefully identify him, and physical evidence (such as DNA or fibers) that can be traced to a particular individual who was suspiciously at the crime scene. Since it is predicated on conduct in the real-world, this approach assumes that the perpetrator of an attack-a crime-was, and still is, physically in the local geographical area.142 The latter assumption gives rise to the "dragnet" tactic, in which officers comb the area for sightings of the perpetrator and for people who know him.143 If attacker-attribution fails for a crime, officers will assume the attacker remains in the local area and will consequently be alert for the possibility that he will re-offend and then be identified.144” (Brenner, 2007, p. 30)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:1. Real-worldAttribution

### Terrorism Presents a Complex Attribution Challenge, Blending Elements of War and Crime

> “With regard to attacker-attribution, terrorism occupies a middle ground between war and crime. While those who carry out a terrorist attack may not identify themselves personally,145 they often identify themselves as acting on behalf of a terrorist group so the group can take credit for the attack.146 Increasingly, terrorism-perpetrators identify themselves as representatives of a particular terrorism group in "martyrdom messages" recorded prior to an attack, especially a suicide attack.147 It is also increasingly common for the group sponsoring a terrorist attack to claim credit for it in a message posted online or on a videotape delivered to media outlets.148 And if the sponsoring group does not claim credit for an attack, the structure and style of the attack may inferentially identify the organization responsible for it.149 In terrorism, as in war, it is usually possible to identify the entity responsible for an attack; but, as with crime, it can be difficult to identify the individuals who actually carried out an attack. Since the current strategy treats terrorism as a type of crime, the criminal investigation approach outlined above is often used to identify and apprehend individual terrorists.150” (Brenner, 2007, p. 32)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution

### Online attacks complicate attribution in cybercrime, terrorism, and warfare.

> “The BIS episode151 illustrates how online attacks complicate attackerattribution across all three dimensions of crime, terrorism, and war. Attacker-attribution becomes problematic at each level because the approaches we use to identify attackers implicitly assume territorially-based activity in the physical world. Since cyberattacks do not take place in physical reality, the attack signatures152 of cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and cyberwarfare generally display few of the empirical characteristics common to their real-world counterparts.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 32)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution

### Attribution for cyberattacks lacks clear geographical indicators.

> “To understand why that is true, we need to parse the BIS attacks. As we saw in the previous section, the real-world crime-terrorism and war attacker-attribution calculi rely on the "place" where an attack occurred or originated from in determining attacker identity. With virtual attacks, a "place" tends to be at once more ambiguous and less conclusive than in real-world analyses.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 32)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:a. Attack Origin

### The ambiguity of cyber attack origins complicates accurate attribution.

> “With cybercrimes, a "place" is ambiguous because while attacks may be routed through Internet servers located in China, this does not necessarily mean that they originated in China. It is common for online attackers to use "stepping stones"-computers the attacker controls but that are owned by innocent parties-in their assaults.153 These "stepping stone" computers can be located anywhere in the physical world because realspace is irrelevant to activity in cyberspace. So, while use of the Chinese servers might mean the attacks came from China, it also might mean they did not come from China. Rather, the attacker might be in Russia, Brazil, or Peoria. Indeed, an attacker located somewhere other than in China and who knew of U.S. concern about China's efforts to develop cyberwarfare capabilities might use Chinese servers deliberately to mask the true source of the attack and mislead the investigators trying to identify him.154 Unless and until investigators reliably establish that the attacks originated in Chinese real-space, we cannot predicate attacker-attribution on inferences drawn from the place of attack origin.155” (Brenner, 2007, p. 33)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:a. Attack Origin

### Repetitive cyber attacks from a location do not guarantee attribution to that location.

> “What if BIS-style attacks were repeated over a period of time, with each attack coming from Chinese servers and each targeting computers used by U.S. government agencies? Can we now predicate attacker-attribution on inferences drawn from the repetitive use of what seems to be the same point of origin? It would be risky to rely on mere repetition; aside from anything else, a virtual Machiavelli might be "framing" China by routing structurally similar attacks through its real-space.156” (Brenner, 2007, p. 33)

### Repetition alongside additional context may strengthen points of origin for attribution.

> “Repetition coupled with other circumstances might support using point of attack origin inferences to establish attacker-attribution. Assume that BIS-style attacks are launched against another U.S. government agency's computers. Investigators trace these attacks to servers in Guangdong, China. Over the last, say, six years, sporadic attacks targeting U.S. government and civilian computers have been traced to Guangdong; some say the attacks were conducted by Chinese military hackers, others say Guangdong University students were responsible for them.157 Can we predicate attacker-attribution inferences on the discontinuous repetition of similar target attacks coming from the same real-world locus in China? Does the (reasonably reliable) identification of a single point of origin support the inference that the recent BIS-style attacks came from Guangdong?158” (Brenner, 2007, p. 33)

### makers must often rely on inference due to the difficulty of conclusively establishing attack origins.

> “Of course, one can still argue that Guangdong's status as the point of origin of the attacks has not been conclusively established. But while certainty is reassuring, it is a luxury decision-makers often cannot afford. In the cyber-world (and the real-world), it can be difficult to conclusively establish the circumstances of an event; here, as is often true for real-world events, decision-makers will sometimes have to rely on inference. For the purposes of analysis, therefore, we will assume the facts in the previous paragraph support the inference that the hypothesized BIS-style attacks were launched by "someone" in Guangdong. That brings us to the next question: how, if at all, does the inference that the attacks came from Guangdong advance the process of identifying the "someone" who is responsible for the attacks?” (Brenner, 2007, p. 34)

### Attack origin is crucial for attributing cyber attacks to nation-states.

> “Point of attack origin has historically played an important role in attacker-attribution for acts of war because war is a conflict between nationstates. The victims of such attacks have therefore typically inferred with a high degree of confidence that an attack originating in another nation-state is attributable to that nation-state. If we apply this logic to the scenario given above, the U.S. could rationally infer that the BIS-style attacks on U.S. government agency computers were acts of war launched by China. It could, in effect, construe the attacks as the virtual equivalent of Japan's real-world attack on Pearl Harbor. The problem with this derivative inference159 of responsibility lies in equating an attack inferentially launched from Chinese territory with an attack launched by the Chinese nation-state.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 34)

### Cyberspace allows non-state actors to conduct virtual attacks across borders.

> “Historically, it was reasonable to equate transnational attacks with acts of war because only a nation-state could launch such an attack.160 That is still true for the real-world, but cyberspace gives each nation-state an incremental, highly permeable set of "virtual" national borders. Anyone with Internet access and certain skills can launch a cross-border virtual attack, not on the territory but on the machinery of an external nationstate.161 A virtual attack is not territorially invasive, but it produces effects in the victim-state's territory that are damaging in various ways and in varying degrees. The character and extent of the damage inflicted will tend to be a function of the nature of the attack and will be examined in Section III.B.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 35)

### Online attacks complicate attribution due to ambiguous points of origin.

> “In terms of the war calculus, there are two reasons why point of attack origin plays a more problematic role in analyzing online attacks. First, identifying the point of origin is likely to depend more on inference in online attacks than in real-world attacks; this introduces an element of ambiguity into the attribution calculus. Second, an identified external point of origin (that is, an attack originated in Nation-State X's territory) can be inconclusive. An identified external point of origin cannot routinely be construed as an attack by the point of the originating state because cyberspace gives essentially anyone the ability to launch transnational attacks.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 35)

### Crime and terrorism pose threats to internal order.

> “This leaves the role that point of attack origin plays in the crimeterrorism calculus. While crime and terrorism are conceptually distinct phenomena, we will consider them jointly in this analysis because both represent threats to internal order (and, as discussed earlier, law treats terrorism as crime). Unlike war, which threatens a society's ability to maintain external order, crime and terrorism are the product of individual rather than state action.162” (Brenner, 2007, p. 35)

### Point of attack origin has a limited role in crime and terrorism attribution.

> “Point of attack origin has historically played a much more limited role in crime and terrorism attacker-attribution than in war attribution. While point of attack origin can inferentially indicate who may have been responsible for a crime or an act of terrorism, the link between origin and attribution is much more attenuated than in war analysis.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 36)

### Attack origin and occurrence are often indistinguishable in real-world scenarios.

> ““The primary reason for this is that in the real-world, point of attack origin and point of attack occurrence are often so closely related as to be indistinguishable for crime, and even for terrorism.163 A crack dealer buys and sells crack in his neighborhood;164 the points of origin and occurrence of his drug crimes are functionally identical. In 1982, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), a terrorist group, bombed a disco frequented by British soldiers in Ballykelly, Northern Ireland, killing eleven soldiers and six civilians; the INLA agents who carried out the bombing operated out of nearby Derry.165 Since the points of attack origin and occurrence for this act of terrorism were separated by only a short distance, one can argue that they are functionally identical here as well.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 36)

### Lack of differentiation complicates attribution processes.

> “If there is little or no differentiation between the point of attack origin and the point of attack occurrence, identifying the point of origin is unlikely to markedly advance the process of identifying the attacker. Assume a woman is raped as she leaves Ladies Night at a neighborhood bar. She left at closing time and was attacked in the nearby parking lot where she left her car.166 Police are likely to infer that the attacker is an opportunistic local who is familiar with the bar's closing time, with its Ladies Nights, and with the fact that patrons use the rather isolated parking lot.,167 This inference establishes that, insofar as an attack such as this has a distinct point of origin, it is in the local area. This inference would also play a role in the police's attempt to identify the rapist by focusing their efforts on the area the bar serves. Police would interview people who might have seen someone in the area that night or might have heard someone talking about the rape. They would also check the location and alibis of locals with sex crime convictions and pursue other, similar leads.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 37)

### Attack origin is just one factor in identifying offenders.

> “As this hypothetical illustrates, point of attack origin tends to be merely one factor in the inferential and evidence-gathering processes law enforcement officers use to identify those responsible for real-world crime and terrorism. It has played a lesser, implicit role in crime and terrorism attacker-attribution because these threats to internal order have, at least until recently, come primarily, if not exclusively, from domestic actors.168 Domestic actors are presumptively in the nation-state where the attack occurred, and investigators tend to assume that the domestic actors responsible for an attack remain in the locality where it occurred. Even when there is significant spatial differentiation between point of origin and point of occurrence, identifying the former serves at most as a clue-an inferential datum that can contribute to the identification of the attackers and, if terrorism, of the sponsoring terrorist organization.169” (Brenner, 2007, p. 37)

### Online crime changes the significance of attack origin.

> “As crime and terrorism migrate online, point of attack origin can assume more importance in attacker-attribution. As we saw in our discussion of war attribution, cyberspace eliminates the need for physical proximity between attacker and victim and thereby creates the potential for increased differentiation between point of attack origin and point of occurrence.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 37)

### The Rome Labs case illustrates challenges in online attack attribution.

> “In 1994, workers at the Rome Air Development Center (Rome Labs) in upstate New York discovered that the lab's computer systems had been hacked by unknown persons.170 The hackers had, among other things, copied data from computers containing sensitive Air Force research and development data.171 Since hacking (unauthorized access) is a federal crime, Air Force, Secret Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents immediately began investigating the incidents, hoping to identify the perpetrators.172 They found a complex attack signature: the attackers had routed their attacks through multiple computers in various countries.173 Through a process too intricate to describe here, the U.S. investigators eventually traced the attacks to the United Kingdom where, with Scotland Yard's assistance, they identified two adolescents as the Rome Labs attackers.174 Both were prosecuted, though with mixed results.175” (Brenner, 2007, p. 38)

### Cyberspace undermines assumptions of attacker accountability.

> “The Rome Labs case illustrates how and why the use of cyberspace can make attacker-attribution more difficult. Cyberspace erodes law enforcement's ability to assume that an attacker is parochial. The viability of that default assumption still holds for real-world crime, and can also hold for real-world terrorism, but its applicability to online crime and terrorism is increasingly problematic.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 38)

### Parochial attacker assumptions are valid for personal cyber attacks.

> “When it comes to cybercrime and even some types of cyberterrorism, the parochial-attacker assumption is most likely to hold for "personal" attacks: crimes and acts of terrorism in which the perpetrator's motives are idiosyncratically emotional.176 In these cases-where John uses cyberspace to stalk his former girlfriend or Jane uses it to attack her employer-the perpetrator and victim are in the same area, but instead of using physical activity in that real-space to conduct the attack, the perpetrator vectors it through cyberspace.177” (Brenner, 2007, p. 39)

### Cyberspace constitutes an origin point for personal attacks.

> “This creates an epistemological issue: When attacker and attacked are in the same real-space area throughout an attack conducted online, did the attack originate in the real-space occupied by attacker and victim, online, or in both? For the purposes of attacker-attribution, the answer should be both.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 39)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:a. Attack Origin:ii. Crime-terrorism

### Both space and cyberspace can define attack origins.

> “In "personal" attack cases, the connections between attacker and victim mean that the parochial-attacker assumption is likely to be very useful in identifying the attacker. Thus far, cyber-vendettas seem primarily to originate in real-world contacts between attacker and victim.178 This assessment means that investigators can profitably rely on the approach used for real-world crime and terrorism, focusing on inferences derived from a real-world context. Therefore, for the purposes of this approach, the attack should be construed as originating in the real-space occupied by attacker and victim.179” (Brenner, 2007, p. 39)

### Extraterritorial origins complicate traditional attribution methods.

> “But the origin of the attack should not be the only focus of their investigation. When a "personal" attacker uses cyberspace, it, too, becomes a "place" of origin of the attack. Its role in the investigation of "personal" attacks is analogous to the role that a physical point of attack origin plays in the traditional investigative process. Cyberspace, like a real-world point of attack origin, becomes a source of inferential data that can be used to identify the attacker.'180 If, for instance, a stalker consistently uses a specific website in tormenting his victim, that website becomes "a" point of origin of the attack and should be treated as such.181 Even if the attacker has not revealed his identity to the site operator, his use of that particular website may provide inferential data as to his identity.182” (Brenner, 2007, p. 40)

### Distance allows online attackers to operate without geographical limitations.

> “What about attacks in which the attacker is not, by any definition, in the same real-space as the victim? In the BIS attacks, the target was in Washington, D.C., while the attackers were (presumably) in China; in the Rome Labs attacks, the target was in upstate New York, while the attackers were in Cardiff, Wales, and London.183 An identified point of attack origin serves a very different function in cases like these, for several reasons.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 40)

### Cyberspace fractures crime scenes into complex shards.

> “First, identifying the point of attack origin in attacks such as these serves an initial, essentially negative function in attacker-attribution. It tells the investigators that the parochial-attacker assumption and derivative investigative approach that they use for real-world crime and terrorism will probably be of little use in identifying the attackers. When an attack presents functionally coterminous points of attack origin and occurrence, we have a localized crime scene that becomes the focal point of the investigation. Evidence, inferences, observations of witnesses, and connections between victim and attacker all radiate from and revolve around this unitary crime scene. It creates a comprehensible focus for the investigation and, in so doing, makes the investigation a manageable task. In complex serial-killer cases, we have seen how expanding a single crime scene into a variegated network of geographically-dispersed, victimidiosyncratic, real-space crime scenes can test the limits of the traditional investigative approach.184” (Brenner, 2007, p. 40)

### Fractured crime scenes complicate identifying the attacker's origin.

> “But even ambitious serial killers operate on a limited geographical scale: in the U.S., they have tended to confine their activities to a smaller area within a state, sometimes to the state itself, and in unusual instances, to surrounding states.185 The physical constraints of the real-world limit the frequency and geographical dispersion of the attacks real-world serial killers can successfully carry out.186 However, this limitation is not true for other offenses once cyberspace becomes a component of criminal and/or terrorist activity. Instead, one can strike anonymously from any point connected to the Internet and iterate the attacks with a frequency impossible in the real-world.187” (Brenner, 2007, p. 41)

### ISP connections can mislead investigators in cybercrime cases.

> “Cyberspace fractures the crime-scene into shards, the number of which depends on the particular circumstances of an attack. One constant shard is the alpha point of attack origin-the place where the attacker is physically located and from which she launches the attack. Other, variable crime scene shards (beta, gamma) are the intermediary points of transmission used in the attack; each represents the occurrence of a constituent, spatially diverse event that contributed to the success of the ultimate attack.188 The other constant shard, the omega shard, is the place of attack occurrence, which we will examine in the next section.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 41)

### Identifying the true point of origin can be legally complex.

> “Fracturing the crime scene into shards makes identifying the point of attack origin and linking it to the attacker much more difficult. Aside from anything else, a fractured crime scene can result in false positives-in investigators assuming that an intermediary point of transmission of an attack is the originating point for the attack.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 41)

### Tracing attacks relies on international cooperation and may be slow.

> “This situation could have happened in the Rome Labs case. Here, the investigators initially traced the two intruders back to an ISP, "mindvox.phantom.com, in New York City."'189 The provider allegedly had ties to the Legion of Doom, a hacker group several members of which had been convicted of unlawful intrusion crimes a few years earlier.190 The investigators could logically have assumed that this ISP was the originating point for the attack on the Rome Labs computers, given its immediate connection to the attack and its apparent ties to hackers.191 This assumption would have been consistent with the real-world approach to investigating crime because it tends to incorporate the notion that point of attack origin is a binary concept. Real-world "places" tend to be mutually exclusive: a real-world "place" is either the point of attack origin or it is not; if it is the point of attack origin, other "places" cannot be. Since it was clear that the immediately-proximate source of the attack was the New York ISP, it could, logically, have been deemed to be "the" point of attack origin for the Rome Labs attack.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 42)

### Identifying attack origins may not simplify tracing responsible actors.

> “Identifying the New York ISP as the point of origin would have been a false positive, one that most certainly would have derailed the investigation. Fortunately, the investigators continued to investigate and eventually identified a trail of attack increments that utilized many computers in various countries.192 However, they were not able to track the increments back to their true points of origin. Ironically, the Rome Labs investigators ultimately identified the perpetrators-"Datastream Cowboy" and "Kuji"the old-fashioned way: by using informants.193 They knew that the attackers used these noms de hack, so the investigators sent people to chat rooms to see if either was taking credit for the attacks.194 Datastream Cowboy not only took credit, he also revealed that he was from the United Kingdom and gave an informant his home telephone number.195 It became a simple matter to identify and apprehend him, though doing the same for Kuji took a while longer.196 This episode illustrates the way that cyberspace can fracture the crime scene into shards, which makes it more difficult to determine the point of origin of an attack.197 Making this determination proved impossible for the Rome Labs investigators because of the intricate paths the attackers used.198” (Brenner, 2007, p. 42)

### Extraterritorial origins can offer clues to identifying cyber attackers.

> “Another issue that can complicate the process of backtracking through a series of incremental attack stages is the legal process involved.199 Incremental attack stages will almost certainly involve the use of computers in different countries.200 To gain access to the necessary information to trace an attack back through those computers, law enforcement will have to obtain assistance from government and civilian entities in the countries in which the computers were used.201 This process can be difficult and timeconsuming. The formal methods used to obtain assistance can take months or even years when digital evidence is fragile and can disappear by the time the investigators obtain the assistance they need.202 Furthermore, not all countries have criminalized hacking or other computer malfeasance, sometimes making it impossible to obtain assistance from the authorities.203” (Brenner, 2007, p. 43)

### Point of attack origin's role in identifying attackers is limited.

> “Even if the investigators obtain the assistance they need and are confident they have traced an attack back to its true point of origin, this may not markedly advance their effort to identify the attacker. The BIS attacks are instructive in this regard. Investigators in that case accurately ascertained that the attacks came from servers in China. However, this information could neither directly nor inferentially establish who was responsible for the attacks or, indeed, what kind of attacks they were.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 43)

### Extraterritorial origins can offer clues to identifying cyber attackers.

> “In some instances, identifying the ultimate extraterritorial point of attack origin can serve the same function an identified point of origin serves in investigating real-world crime-it can become an inferential datum that contributes to identifying the attacker.204 Assume the FBI has information independently derived from informants or from other online investigations that a Romanian gang is engaged in phishing.205 If the FBI then traces a phishing attack to Romania, it would be reasonable to infer that it came from the gang already under suspicion.206 The inference would be strengthened if, say, the attack were traced to the city out of which the gang is known to operate or if the attack signature displayed elements peculiar to this gang's operations.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 44)

### Point of attack origin's role in identifying attackers is limited.

> “In sum, while point of attack origin can play a role in identifying the attackers in a cybercrime or cyberterrorism event, its function tends to be limited, and will probably become more so as cyberattackers become more sophisticated about hiding their tracks.207” (Brenner, 2007, p. 44)

### The distinction between war and cybercrime is increasingly blurred.

> “In the previous sections, we considered attacker-attribution and other issues presented by crime and terrorism, cyber and otherwise. We have assumed for the purpose of analysis that there is a distinct conceptual divide between war, which is conducted by nation-states, and crime and terrorism, which are carried out by individuals. While this distinction is still useful for analyzing attacker-attribution in real-world and online attacks, it is not as stable as it once was.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 44)

### State-sponsored terrorism and crime represent serious legal challenges.

> “Over the last several decades, the hybrid phenomena of statesponsored terrorism and state-sponsored crime have emerged as increasingly serious threats.208 Both present distinct legal issues, most notably with regard to the efficacy of attempting to use criminal sanctions to deter an activity sponsored by a nation-state.209 Aside from anything else, a sponsoring state may not cooperate in the investigation, apprehension, and extradition of those who acted on its behalf in committing criminal or terrorist acts.210” (Brenner, 2007, p. 45)

### State-sponsored cyber threats complicate legal accountability.

> “Notwithstanding the complexities associated with the mechanics of bringing these offenders to justice,211 analysis of attacker-attribution for individually-perpetrated attacks and for acts of war can be useful in a statesponsored cybercrime and cyberterrorism context. Yet, the ultimate determination of responsibility for attacks falling into these categories will require ascertaining the nature of the attacks-an issue we take up below.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 45)

### Differentiating between cyberwarfare and cybercrime is crucial for attribution.

> “To understand why this is true, reconsider the BIS attacks. We are assuming they were launched from Guangdong, China. We know they targeted computer systems used by a sensitive U.S. government agency in Washington, D.C. We analyzed how the attacker-attribution calculus should proceed if the attacks were cyberwarfare or "personal" cybercrime/cyberterrorism. Inherent in this analysis was the need to differentiate the two categories of attacks. The act of distinguishing involves both identifying an attacker and identifying the nature of an attack, because for cyberwarfare, the same factor establishes both. If the attackerattribution calculus indicated that an attack "came from" a nation-state (command and control), we concluded it was war; otherwise, it fell into the residual category of cybercrime or cyberterrorism.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 45)

### Determining the origin of a cyberattack poses significant challenges.

> “One problem with this analysis is that determining whether a cyberattack "comes from" a specific nation-state can be difficult because territorial point of attack origin can be ambiguous in this context. An attack from Guangdong might "come from" China itself or it might "come from" sport hackers212 who are adventitiously in Guangdong. Essentially, point of attack origin's utility in attacker-attribution has, to this point, been limited to negating the proposition that an attack is an instance of cyberwarfare. If we conclude with some confidence that an attack did not "come from" a nation-state actor, we inferentially assign it to the cybercrime/cyberterrorism category and embark upon the tasks of determining precisely what it is and who is responsible for it.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 45)

### State involvement in cyberattacks complicates distinctions between crime and warfare.

> “The other problem with our earlier analysis is that nation-state "involvement" in an attack is no longer synonymous with warfare.213 In the real-world, we now have intermediate categories of nation-state involvement that, among other things, have given us state-sponsored crime and state-sponsored terrorism.214 State-sponsored crime has already migrated online, and state-sponsored terrorism will certainly follow.215 The problem, for the moment, is parsing out whether an attack is "mere" cybercrime or state-sponsored cybercrime, "mere" cyberterrorism or statesponsored cyberterrorism.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 46)

### State sponsorship complicates the assessment of cyberattack involvement.

> “State sponsorship necessarily involves a level of state participation in a cyberattack, but identifying a nation-state's involvement in a less-thancyberwarfare attack will surely be difficult. Point of attack origin is unlikely to be helpful in this effort, for at least two reasons. First, the fact that an attack originates in the territory of a nation-state, even one known to be inclined to sponsor terrorist activity, is inconclusive. Attack origination on its territory might mean the state is involved in the attack, but it might not;216 territorial origination is inferentially even less significant here than it is for cyberwarfare. Second, the fact an attack originates outside the territory of a particular nation-state does not necessarily mean the nationstate is not sponsoring the attack. As we have seen in the real-world, state sponsorship can take many forms, such as providing terrorists with "funding, weapons, training and sanctuary.217” (Brenner, 2007, p. 46)

### A nation can support cybercriminals to easily deny involvement in attacks.

> “A Machiavellian nation could fund and otherwise support terrorists (or criminals) who launch cyberattacks from outside its territory on a nationstate it wants to see "harmed"--economically undermined, harassed, rendered vulnerable to overtures, or intimidated in the real-world.218 The point of attack origin might be traced and used to identify the individual attackers, but it would reveal nothing about the sponsoring nation-state's complicity in the attack; indeed, since the attacks originated outside the physical "presence" of this rogue nation-state, this nation-state would plausibly be able to deny any association with them.219” (Brenner, 2007, p. 47)

### Difficulties arise in proving state complicity in cyberattacks launched domestically.

> “If the attacks were launched from within its territory, our hypothetical state sponsor of cybercrime and cyberterrorism could still credibly deny involvement with them. Physical attacks involve detectable staging efforts that can be difficult to conceal, which can make it challenging for a nationstate to disavow knowledge of (and at least tacit complicity in) activity within its borders.220 State-sponsored cyberattacks, like their civilian counterparts, are presumably clandestine in staging and in execution, and, unlike physical attacks, involve computer activities which are harder to detect and easier to conceal. The sovereign-sponsor of such domesticallylaunched attacks could therefore plausibly deny knowledge of and involvement with them in the same way and for the same reasons nationstates concede their inability to identify cybercriminals ex ante (or even ex post).221 A devious nation-state might even be able to conceal its involvement in self-interested cyberattacks by encouraging "civilian" cybercriminals and cyberterrorists to conduct their operations from within its borders since the fog of "civilian" cyberattacks would obscure the purpose and origins of the state-sponsored attacks.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 47)

### Point of attack origin is less useful in attributing state responsibility for cyberattacks.

> “As these examples illustrate, point of attack origin will not be particularly helpful in attributing state responsibility for sponsored cyberattacks because we are dealing with tiered responsibility: primary responsibility for an attack rests with the individuals who carry it out, while secondary responsibility rests with the nation-state that sponsored their efforts.222 As discussed earlier, an identified point of attack origin can play a role in primary attacker-attribution for cybercrime and cyberterrorism; however, that role diminishes for secondary attacker-attribution because of the sponsor's indirect participation in the attack.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 47)

### The distinction between point of attack occurrence and origin is critical in warfare.

> “For real-world warfare, point of attack occurrence is the essential complement to point of attack origin, its inevitable counterpoint in the attack dynamic. Point of attack origin tells us which country (or countries, since war can be a plural dynamic) has initiated war; point of attack occurrence tells us which country is the "victim." The points of attack origin and occurrence will therefore be in different countries when the attack constitutes an act of war.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 48)

> “This calculus is unambiguous in the real-world because "place" is unambiguous in the real-world. For example, when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, it clearly initiated war.223 The calculus becomes ambiguous if and when warfare migrates online. We saw earlier how defining point of attack origin becomes problematic in this context. Even if we can ascertain with the requisite level of confidence that an online act of war "came from" a specific nation-state, we cannot reflexively attribute that attack to the nation-state from which it came.224” (Brenner, 2007, p. 48)

### Assuming attacks originate from a specific location does not equate to state responsibility.

> “We will again assume for the purposes of analysis that these attacks originated in Guangdong, China. Can we infer that cyberattacks originating in China and occurring "in" the United States represent acts of war attributable to the Chinese government? Unlike real-world acts of war, in this situation, we do not have the presence of enemy personnel and armament on U.S. soil. We have only the virtual "presence" of signals, bits and bytes, which traveled through cyberspace by routine means, the same means used by civilian and government traffic every second of every day. The signals bear neither state insignia nor other markers of military allegiance or intent.225 Our only bases for possibly concluding they constitute components of an act of war by the Chinese government are their point of origin, their geographic destination, and the nature of the harm they inflicted (damage to U.S. government computers). I will defer my consideration of the third factor until later, because it concerns the nature of the attack,226 but will analyze the other two factors now.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 49)

### Occurrence of attacks on a nation's territory raises implications of war.

> “We have already analyzed the inherent ambiguity of the point of origin of this attack, which lies in determiningthe point of origin. Here, the point of attack occurrence is not ambiguous in and of itself; we know it occurred in the United States. The ambiguity lies in the implications of this point of attack occurrence. In the real-world, the occurrence of an act of war on Nation-State A's territory is equivalent to a declaration of war by the nation responsible for the attack. This is because war has historically been about territory; the violation of one nation-state's territorial integrity by agents of another nation-state is a challenge to its ability to maintain external order, that is, to sustain its existence as an autonomous entity.227” (Brenner, 2007, p. 49)

### Transborder cyberattacks cannot automatically be deemed acts of war.

> “In the real-world, then, the singular inference to be drawn from an attack originating in the territory of one nation-state and occurring inside the territory of another is war; real-world transborder attacks have been equated with warfare because only nation-states could (and did) launch such attacks. If we were dealing with real-world attacks, therefore, the rational (if not exclusive) inference would be that they were acts of war launched by China.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 49)

### The cyber environment complicates traditional warfare attributions.

> “But we are not in the real-world; we are in the cyber world, where transborder attacks are not the exclusive province of nation-states. We therefore cannot infer from the mere fact that the attacks targeted computers on U.S. territory that this is the equivalent of Hitler invading Poland. Instead, it could be adolescent sport hackers in Guangdong exploring U.S computers.228 In utilizing point of attack occurrence as a factor in attacker attribution, we must modify the assumption that equates transborder attacks with war so it incorporates a basic reality of the online environment. U.S. government and civilian computers now come within an analog of the Willie Sutton rule; that is, they are attacked because they are particularly attractive targets for criminals, terrorists, and, ultimately, nation-states bent on war.229 Since U.S. computers are attractive targets for all three categories of attackers, and since any of them can launch transborder attacks, the mere fact that an externally-launched attack occurs "in" the United States cannot sustain the conclusion that the attack was“an act of war on the part of the nation-state from whose territory it originated.230” (Brenner, 2007, p. 50)

> “Point of attack occurrence is an integral component of attackerattribution for crimes and acts of terrorism. Real-world investigations concentrate on the scene of the crime or terrorist event, on the place where the attack occurred. This investigative model is based on the assumption that the players in the attack dynamic (criminals/terrorists and victims) occupied shared real-space; this assumption derives from the inescapable fact that physical proximity is an essential prerequisite for the commission of real-world crime or terrorism.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 50)

### The significance of attack location diminishes as attacks transition online.

> “Here, again, the importance of point of attack occurrence diminishes as attacks move online. A real-space attacker's gaining entry to a home that has an armed alarm system suggests the attacker knew the victim, but a cyberspace attacker's gaining entry to a home computer hooked to a cable modem does not. Similarly, a hacker's transferring funds from online bank accounts is likely not an inside job. Although the bank presumably had measures in place that were intended to limit virtual access to the accounts, the compromise of those measures, unlike the compromise of the jewelry store safe, did not necessarily involve privileged physical access either to the accounts or to "inside" information needed to access them. Investigators can infer with a high degree of confidence that the compromise of the jewelry store safe came from an employee or a former employee who was given the combination as a routine part of his employment or from someone with whom that employee shared the information. The physical constraints that govern action in the real-world make it eminently reasonable to draw certain inferences from the place where an attack occurred; the absence of those constraints makes it problematic, if not impossible, to predicate similar inferences on the place where a virtual attack occurred. Cyberspace nullifies the influence of the three spatial dimensions that constrain action in the real-world and, in so doing, erodes the significance of place in attacker-attribution.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 51)

### Virtual attacks involve points of attack but create a fragmented evidence landscape.

> “The point of attack occurrence still plays a role in attacker-attribution for online crimes and acts of terrorism because it is literally the place where an attack occurred. More precisely, it is the place where the virtual attack was consummated. Real-world attacks are initiated and consummated in a single physical place, which then becomes the crime scene. As we saw earlier, the utilization of cyberspace breaks the crime scene into shards. Here, the place where the attack actually occurs-where the harm is inflicted on the victim-is part of a larger crime scene. Like a real-world crime scene, it will contain evidence that can be used in an attempt to track the person(s) responsible for the attack. Unlike a real-world crime scene, however, it is not self-contained; the evidence found at this virtual crime scene is part of a sequence of digital evidence that is strewn around cyberspace and stored on the computers used in the attack. Since the ultimate crime scene accounts for only part of the available evidence, its role in the inferential process of identifying the attacker is accordingly reduced.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 51)

### Identifying attackers in cybercrime relies on understanding the nature of their attacks.

> “And as with cyberwarfare, determining the identity of the attacker responsible for crimes or acts of terrorism will often be bound up with determining the nature of an attack. I return to this issue in Section III.B.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 52)

### Point of attack occurrence aids in state-sponsored cybercrime attribution.

> “The role of point of attack occurrence in attacker-attribution for statesponsored cybercrime and cyberterrorism is functionally indistinguishable from the role it plays in assigning individual responsibility for online crime and acts of terrorism. Here, too, it is simply part of the total crime scenethe point at which an attack is consummated. Digital evidence retrieved from the point of attack occurrence can be used in efforts to backtrack the attack to its source and can be the basis for an inference as to primary and secondary responsibility for an attack, once investigators determine that it was state-sponsored. In making this determination, investigators should factor the analog of the Willie Sutton rule into the calculus because, as we saw earlier, point of attack occurrence cannot itself sustain a finding of nation-state responsibility.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 52)

### Attacker-attribution has been historically problematic for crime and terrorism, distinguishing them from warfare.

> “As we saw earlier, attacker-attribution (who-attribution) has historically been problematic in the real-world, at least for crime and terrorism, but attack-attribution (what-attribution) has not. The reason for this lies in the distinction societies have drawn between threats to internal order and threats to external order. 233 In the real-world, that distinction traditionally divided attacks into two categories: crime/terrorism (internal) and war (external).234” (Brenner, 2007, p. 52)

### The distinction between internal and external threats arose from historical realities limiting non-state actors.

> “This division, and the distinction upon which it was predicated, arose from the realities of the physical world. At least until the last century, the limitations of travel and state monopolization of military-grade weaponry made it functionally impossible for non-state actors to challenge a nationstate's ability to maintain its territorial integrity as a sovereign entity.235” (Brenner, 2007, p. 52)

### Historical context shows that real-world attacks fall into crime/terrorism or warfare, affecting attribution.

> “External order was a purely sovereign concern; nation-states challenged each other in the international arena and resolved matters with military combat. Non-state actors were limited to challenging a state's ability to maintain internal order; criminals' pursuit of self-gratification and the more doctrinaire activities of terrorists threatened to erode social order in varying ways and to varying degrees. For at least a century and a half, nation-states have employed a unique strategy-civilian law enforcement-to control internal threats. 236 This two-pronged strategy consists of adopting laws that criminalize crime and terrorism and using a specialized, quasi-military force to identify and apprehend those who violate the laws.237 Violators are prosecuted, convicted, and sanctioned, which presumptively deters them from re-offending and others from following their example. 238” (Brenner, 2007, p. 53)

> “The sections below examine attacker-attribution, in the real-world and then in the virtual world of cyberspace. As part of this analysis, the first section incorporates some consideration of the response mechanisms we employ for each category of threats in the real-world; the next section continues that approach by demonstrating how the attribution ambiguity in online attacks impacts response mechanisms.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 53)

### The subsequent sections will analyze real-world and cyberspace attacker-attribution and their response mechanisms.

> “As a combined function of history and empirical circumstance, real world attacks have fallen discretely into either of two categories: crime/terrorism or warfare. In analyzing attacker-attribution, we saw how and why the respective distinguishing characteristics of crime/terrorism and warfare have been apparent and unambiguous in the real-world.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 54)

### Real-world attacks have been categorized as crime/terrorism or warfare, with clear distinguishing characteristics.

> “Crime is easy to identify because it involves the civilian-on-civilian infliction of familiar categories of harm, such as theft, robbery, rape, murder, fraud, and arson.239 Crime also tends to be limited in scale because of the constraints that physical reality imposes on action in the realworld.240 The next most common crime scale model in the real-world is many-to-one victimization; however, the one-to-many victimization typical of cybercrime is almost unknown in the real-world because of the physical constraints noted above. 241” (Brenner, 2007, p. 54)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:b. Occurrence:iii. State-sponsored crime/terrorism:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION

### Crime is easily identifiable due to familiar harm categories and physical constraints limiting its scale.

> “Real-world terrorism is also usually easy to identify even though it involves activity that can fall within the definition of crime, harming people and destroying property. Real-world terrorism can usually be distinguished from crime because (1) it seems irrational in that it has no obvious mundane motive, such as self-enrichment or revenge; and (2) the scale on which it is committed often vastly exceeds what we encounter with crime. Take the attacks on the World Trade Center: they were irrational in that they produced no financial gains (unlike bombing one of the towers to rob a bank) and redressed no personal grievances. We regard crime as rational when it is committed for financial gain or for emotional reasons that have an underlying logical calculus, such as revenge.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 54)

### Real-world terrorism is distinguishable from crime by its irrational motives and larger scale of harm.

> “There are irrational crimes. In the U.S., one can read daily about murders that were committed for no rational reason, such as ridding oneself of an unwanted spouse. But those crimes tend to be "personal"-to be the product of relationships. Family members kill each other; employees "go postal" and kill co-workers. In these crimes there is a link, a factual nexus between the perpetrator and the victims. And as with all crimes, they also tend to be limited in scale; the perpetrator kills the person she knows and with whom she is angry.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 54)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:b. Occurrence:iii. State-sponsored crime/terrorism:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION

### Irrational crimes are typically personal and limited in scale, unlike terrorism.

> “We do on occasion have what seem to be purely irrational incidents of mass murder and serial killings, but here, too, it is usually obvious that we are dealing with crime, not terrorism. As one source noted, in mass murder the motive "is likely to be personal," while serial killings "'often [have] a sexual component.' 242 Even though the underlying rationale (if any) of these crimes may not be immediately apparent, we understand from the circumstances of their commission that they are, in fact, crimes. We realize that the mass murderer who climbs a tower and shoots anyone who comes within range is engaged in an act that is one step removed from "personal" assault-that is, he is taking revenge for real or wholly perceived wrongs fortuitously and indiscriminately. We also realize that the activities of serial killers-which otherwise seem incomprehensible-are the product of what seems to be a distinct psychopathology that drives them to "hunt humans."243” (Brenner, 2007, p. 55)

### Mass murders and serial killings are generally identifiable as crimes, not terrorism.

> “Terrorism is fundamentally different. It derives not from "personal" concerns or skewed psyches but from ideology. In real-world terrorism, the activity is actually but not ostensibly rational: Why would anyone fly a plane into the World Trade Center? The motivations of the Al Qaeda members who actually did this are quite rational if one accepts the ideological premises from which they operated. But to the uninitiated, the conduct seems irrational because of the nature of the act itself and because the actors forfeited their lives. Nearly all criminals (even mass murderers) try to survive; their motives come from self-interest, not sacrifice.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 55)

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:b. Occurrence:iii. State-sponsored crime/terrorism:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION

### Terrorism is driven by ideology rather than personal motivations, differentiating it from crime.

> “As noted above, another factor is the scale on which harm is inflicted. Because crime is the product of individual motivations and the physical constraints governing activity in the real-world, it tends to be committed on a limited scale. 244 A mugger robs one victim, a rapist assaults another, a killer murders yet another; in each instance, as with most crime, we have one-to-one victimization.245 The scale on which terrorism is committed tends to be more inexact, regardless of whether it involves flying planes into buildings or suicide bombing. Consider the suicide bomber. He wants to inflict as much death, injury, and property destruction as possible, and takes that into account in selecting the area where he will detonate his bomb. However, the scale on which he will actually inflict harm remains uncertain until the attack has been consummated because the context in which suicide bombers operate (unannounced attacks in public areas) is fluid. The harm the bomber inflicts will almost certainly exceed that attributable to any crime, because whereas crime inflicts a focused harm (profit, revenge, sexual control), terrorism inflicts generalized, variegated harms. Aside from anything else, the theatrical nature of terrorist violence usually serves to distinguish it from criminal violence.

## III. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:A. ATTACKER-ATTRIBUTION:2. Online Attribution:b. Occurrence:iii. State-sponsored crime/terrorism:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION

### The scale of harm in crime is limited, while terrorism aims for broader, generalized harm.

> “Overall, the internal-external threat dichotomy and resulting allocation of responsibility for responding to threats has proven quite satisfactory in the real-world. There can be initial definitional ambiguity between crimes and acts of terrorism; but since both have represented purely internal threats to social order and since internal threats are addressed by civilian law enforcement, ambiguity as to whether an attack was crime or terrorism has little, if any, impact on the civilian response process. For our purposes, the residual category of war has had no corresponding definitional ambiguity246 and no operational uncertainty; the military is exclusively responsible for responding to acts of war.247” (Brenner, 2007, p. 56)

### Online attack attribution is problematic for response processes.

> “Here we turn again to the BIS attacks, but now our focus is on identifying the nature of the attack, not the attacker. We addressed this issue implicitly, in our consideration of online attacker-attribution, but we need to articulate why online attack-attribution becomes problematic and how this impacts our response processes.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 57)

### BIS attacks were deliberate and targeted federal computers from China.

> “We begin by parsing out what we know of the BIS attacks. It is clear they were deliberate, orchestrated attacks, not computer malfunctions; they targeted computers used by a federal agency; they originated in China; and we assume they came from Guangdong, which is reputationally associated with China's efforts to develop cyberwarfare capability. We do not know what the attackers sought to accomplish,248 but because we know we were attacked, we must decide how to respond.249” (Brenner, 2007, p. 57)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Determining the type of attack influences the appropriate response.

> “Deciding how to respond requires determining what kind of attacks these were; as we saw earlier, the attack-response dynamic is consistent across all three categories of attacks-crime, terrorism, and war. Under our current attack-response model, once we know what kind of attack we are dealing with (internal threat versus external threat), we know what response process is appropriate. If the BIS attacks were crime or terrorism, civilian law enforcement (of whatever level) will respond;250 if they were cyberwarfare, the military will respond.251” (Brenner, 2007, p. 57)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Attack-response dynamics vary based on whether the threat is internal or external.

> “We explored the inherent ambiguity of the attack in our analysis of attacker-attribution and the same issues arise here as well. The circumstances of the attack suggest it was a sortie into cyberwarfare-an attack launched at the behest of the Chinese government. As we saw earlier, an attack originating from the territory of one nation-state and terminating on the territory of another nation-state has presumptively constituted an act of war; the validity of that conclusion is reinforced here by the fact that the attacks targeted federal computers rather than civilian or state computers. The nature of the target therefore provides inferential support for the premise that the attacks were an initial, even tentative foray into cyberwarfare. While we do not know precisely what the attacks were meant to accomplish, we could logically conclude that they were a virtual reconnaissance by China's military, a testing of the security of U.S. government computer systems. If we were to arrive at this conclusion with the requisite level of confidence, we would have to decide whether to respond, and if we decided a response was in order, we would have to decide what type of response would be appropriate.252 Since we have, in this analytical branch, concluded that the attacks were cyberwarfare, these decisions and any response will come from the U.S. military. Since we have, at least to this point, decided we are dealing with an external threat to order, civilian law enforcement will not be involved in the decision-making or response processes.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 58)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Ambiguity in attack attribution complicates classification and response.

> “The problem with this analysis is that we cannot conclude the BIS attacks constituted cyberwarfare with the requisite level of confidence because the circumstances-the indicators-we must rely on take on an ambiguity lacking in the real-world. The fact that the attacks originated from the territory of another nation-state is a circumstance we can consider in attack-attribution, but it carries much less weight than in the real-world; as we saw earlier, cyberspace makes it possible for anyone with an Internet connection and a base level of computer skills to attack a computer in another country. The transnational aspect of the attack may be significant, but it also may not be; and the same is true of the attacks' origination in Guangdong and targeting of computers used by a federal agency. Guangdong province has been producing hackers for years,253 and civilian hackers of many nationalities have been exploring federal computers for years.254 It is therefore equally as possible that the attacks came from sport hackers in Guangdong255 as it is that they came from the Chinese government.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 58)

### Indicators of cyberwarfare are ambiguous and require careful analysis.

> “If we decide the BIS attacks were civilian hacks, then they constitute cybercrime and civilian law enforcement will respond.256 If we decide they were cyberwarfare, then the military will respond. But how do we decidehow do we resolve this inherently ambiguous situation?” (Brenner, 2007, p. 59)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Classifying the BIS attacks as cybercrime or cyberwarfare affects response.

> “As I noted earlier, our response strategy is predicated on the premise that we know, or can quickly determine, what kind of an attack occurred and only need to identify and neutralize the attacker(s). Our legal system incorporates that premise; as will be discussed in Section IV, it allocates responsibility for crime/terrorism to law enforcement and for war to the military. The allocation is scrupulously partitioned; civilian law enforcement does not respond to war and the military does not respond to crime.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 59)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Civilian hackers may be mistaken for state-sponsored attackers.

> “This rigidly partitioned response authority gives rise to several concerns. One, as we saw above, is that the response process will be delayed while decision-makers try to determine the nature of an attack. Another is that the decision-makers will misunderstand the nature of an attack. What if a BIS-style attack were to target a corporate computer system? The nature of the attack target inferentially supports the conclusion that it was cybercrime, because we tend to assume criminals target civilians.257 That conclusion would further be reinforced if the attackers' actions conformed to what we expect of cybercriminals; for example, if their efforts consisted of trying to extract funds from corporate accounts or personal information from its customer databases. Since we assume civilians are the targets of crime, not war, an attack such as this would almost certainly be construed as cybercrime and responded to by law enforcement.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 59)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Misinterpretation of attacks could lead to inadequate responses.

> “The problem is that relying on this assumption could be a mistake. The attack on our fictive corporate entity could be cyberwarfare, not cybercrime. China's focus on cyberwarfare specifically includes attacks on258 civilian entities, including financial and infrastructure entities. If our default approach to attacks continues to be the civilian-attacks-are-crime assumption, we will certainly have a situation (or many situations) in which an act of cyberwarfare is construed, and responded to, as if it were merely cybercrime. The consequent, possibly lengthy, delay in realizing what we truly confront could have serious consequences for our financial system or other parts of our infrastructure, especially if we misinterpret a series of cyberattacks.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 60)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Responses to cyberattacks may be delayed due to misclassification.

> “An analogous, but perhaps less serious, problem arises if the attack on our hypothetical corporate entity is cyberterrorism. Cyberterrorist attacks are unlikely to be isolated incidents; it is far more likely that a cyberterrorist event will be part of a sequence of attacks which may be separated spatially, temporally, and have different points of origin.259 Because the corporate attack we hypothesized above seems to be "mere" cybercrime, it would be dealt with by civilian law enforcement. Except for serial killers and the odd career robber or serial arsonist, civilian law enforcement is not accustomed to approaching an attack-a crime-as part of a sequence; the officers who respond to our fictive attack will therefore not likely consider whether it may be part of a much larger attack sequence.260 This means the civilian law enforcement response to a coordinated, sequenced cyberterrorism attack would probably be discrete and isolated; officers in different locations would respond to incidents without realizing that they were, in fact, part of a single, larger attack. As we saw above, the same could be true for cyberwarfare.261” (Brenner, 2007, p. 60)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Cyberterrorism could be misconstrued as ordinary crime.

> “This problem arises both because of our partitioned responsibility for responding to crime/terrorism versus warfare and because we tend to assume that crime, of whatever type, is a localized phenomenon. A subsidiary factor contributing to the problem is that the markers we rely upon to differentiate crime/terrorism from warfare in the real-world are absent or unreliable when it comes to virtual attacks. In the real-world, we rely on three markers-or indicia-to determine the nature of an attack: (1) point of attack origin, (2) point of attack occurrence, and (3) the motive for an attack.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 61)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Response to coordinated attacks may be isolated and ineffective.

> “As we have seen, the utility of the first two markers erodes as attacks migrate online. The same is also true, but in a different way and for different reasons, of the third factor-the motive for an attack. Technology enhances our ability to inflict harm, but does not alter the human psyche; unless and until technology transforms us into cyborgs or some other variety of post-human life,262 it is reasonable to assume that the motives which have historically driven us to inflict harm will continue to account for our doing so, on- or offline. Motive, therefore, is and will continue to be a valid differentiating factor for cyberattacks: profit drives most cybercrime; ideology drives most cyberterrorism; and nation-state rivalries drive cyberwarfare. The difficulty arises not with our ability to rely upon established motivations as a "marker" which inferentially indicates the nature of an attack. It arises instead with our ability to ascertain the motive behind a specific attack.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 61)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Assumptions about the nature of attacks can misguide responses.

> “We saw this with the BIS attacks. We know what the BIS attackers did, but we cannot ascertain why they did it. The same has been true of other highly-publicized U.S. government and corporate attacks, including "Titan Rain" and "Moonlight Maze."263 And the same is likely to be true of many future attacks, as well: while the motive behind what are almost certainly routine cybercrime incidents is usually apparent (greed, revenge, power over another), that may not always be true. Terrorists, for example, are increasingly using cybercrime to finance their real-world efforts, which give us a mixed-motive scenario: the motive for the commission of the cybercrimes is profit, a criminal motive; but the motive for obtaining the profit is to engage in acts of terrorism, a non-criminal motive. This mixed message scenario has few, if any, implications for the response process because civilian law enforcement responds to crime and terrorism; the efficacy of a response to a specific attack will therefore be a function of the extent to which the state targeted by the attack can adequately respond to cybercrime and cyberterrorism.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 61)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Civilian law enforcement may struggle to address state-sponsored cyber threats.

> “A variation of this "mixed message" scenario can have serious implications for a state's ability to respond to attacks. When what is ostensibly cybercrime is state-sponsored-as is often the case with economic espionage-the efficacy of the civilian law enforcement response process breaks down.264 The sponsoring state will almost certainly refuse to cooperate with the investigative efforts of the victim state's law enforcement officers and thereby thwart the crime response process.265 The same result will ensue when a nation-state sponsors cyberterrorism. In neither instance does the sponsoring state have any incentive to cooperate with those who are attempting to bring its agents to justice in the victimized state; indeed, the opposite is true.266 The sponsoring state has every incentive not to cooperate with law enforcement from the victim state, especially if the state-sponsored cybercrime/cyberterrorism is an instance of war-but-not-war, that is, a covert campaign aimed at undermining the economic or structural stability of the victim nation-state.267 This is a class of attacks with which we must be especially concerned, because the harm sought to be inflicted here is systemic, not individual, harm.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 62)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### The potential for systemic harm from state-sponsored cyberattacks is significant.

> “Another class of attacks with which we must be especially concerned is the BIS-style attack-attacks in which no apparent motive exists. The scenario in which we cannot ascertain whether attacks are cybercrime, cyberterrorism, or cyberwarfare creates the greatest challenges for our current response model, and consequently creates the greatest risks for the victim state. It creates marked risks for countries such as the United States, which rigidly partition response authority between civilian and military agents. In these systems, if potential responders cannot ascertain what kind of an attack occurred, they can neither assume nor assign responsibility for responding to it-which creates the possibility that no appropriate response will ensue. 268” (Brenner, 2007, p. 62)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Unclear motives in attacks challenge the current response model.

> “This, in turn, creates the possibility that a country like the United States could be the targets of cyberwarfare and not realize it until the attacker had inflicted substantial systemic damage; this would be particularly true if a dispersed attack seemed to represent cybercrime. Local authorities would deal discretely with each node of the attack, not realizing they were responding to part of a greater whole.269 It also creates the possibility that a concerted attack-cybercrime or cyberterrorism-by an organized group of non-nation-state actors could inflict similar, though perhaps not as substantial, systemic harm on the victim nation-state.270 This latter scenario raises yet another possibility-that of sporadic, concerted271 attacks by one or more organized groups of non-nation-state actors. While the harm these attacks inflicted would not be the immediately devastating kind of harm associated with real-world warfare or real-world terrorism on a 9/11 scale, it would be damaging, particularly if it were repeated.” (Brenner, 2007, p. 63)

## II. IDENTIFYING CYBERCRIME, CYBERTERRORISM, AND CYBERWARFARE:B. ATTACK-ATTRIBUTION:2. Virtual World

### Mixed motives complicate the classification of cyber incidents.

> “This last possibility highlights another difficulty with our current, segmented response processes: civilian law enforcement and military personnel have a very limited ability to join forces in combating attacks. This is due to the persistence of the internal-external threat dichotomy.272 Civilian law enforcement and military personnel have an even more limited ability to join forces with each other and with civilians to respond to attacks. In the nation-state model, the state monopolizes the response processes; civilians can become recruits in the military response process, but otherwise can play no legitimate role in responding to threats.273 This is also due to the internal-external threat dichotomy. Nation-states assume they can maintain internal order with law enforcement personnel and external order with military personnel and that by doing this they establish a secure internal enclave in which civilians need have no concern with, and no responsibility for, attacks.274 As we have seen, cyberspace erodes the validity of both assumptions.275” (Brenner, 2007, p. 63)
