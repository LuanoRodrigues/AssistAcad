# <h1>Some Evidentiary Dimensions of Attributing Unlawful Cyber Operations to States</h1>

## Introduction

### Establishing state responsibility in cyberspace requires proof of various facts.

> “Determination of state responsibility for unlawful conduct in cyberspace requires (as does determination of state responsibility under international law for any unlawful conduct) proof of various facts: the commission of the unlawful conduct, the identity of the person carrying out the action, and the relationship between that person and a state. The first set of fact concerns proof of the breach of a primary rule; the second and the third concern proof of the attributability of the breach to a state, thereby generating the latter’s responsibility for a wrongful act. This paper provides an overview of law and practice on three evidentiary aspects of establishing these facts: burden of proof, standard of proof, and means of proof. Alongside a general review of these evidentiary issues, it examines aspects of these issues that are likely to arise specifically with regard to cyber operations.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 1)

## Introduction

### Lack of uniform treaty provisions complicates evidential standards in international tribunals.

> “There are few treaty provisions relating to matters of evidence in international tribunals, and those that exist are often imprecise. As for general principles of law, those might have been expected to be derived from principles common to the various national legal systems, since every domestic court applies (explicitly or implicitly) some kind of procedural law. However, a comparative examination reveals that at least with regard to the standard of proof there is no uniformity that could be the basis for general principles.1 This paper therefore focuses on the practice of international tribunals and on potential trends that can be ascertained from it.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 2)

## Introduction

### International law is flexible regarding procedural and evidential issues, but this can lead to uncertainty.

> “The approach of international law to procedural and evidentiary issues has been characterised as extremely flexible. As noted in the ICJ, ‘international law ... being primarily based upon the general principles of law and justice, is unfettered by technicalities and formalistic considerations which are often given importance in municipal law’.2 This flexibility is reflected, inter alia, in the absence of explicit articulations of the standard of proof and the type of evidence that may be submitted to meet this standard.3 However, this flexibility has also been criticised for its indeterminacy. For one thing, the resulting uncertainty may have an inhibiting effect on the development and use of international adjudication, especially when the importance of the interests at stake outweighs the necessity of resolving the dispute.4 There are increasing calls for the adoption of a formal standard,5 and since the beginning of the twenty first century, international jurisprudence has been visibly more concerned with developing a coherent procedural framework.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 2)

## Introduction

### Coherence in evidentiary law does not imply uniformity due to diverse dispute mechanisms.

> “Coherence should not be confused with uniformity. The law of evidence is (or ought to be) designed to correspond to the characteristics of the dispute settlement mechanism.6 Given the variety of such mechanisms in the international arena, a variety of evidentiary bodies of law is to be expected (although, as will be seen, existing practice displays significant uniformity). Factors such as the type of parties (states or private actors), the composition of the bench,7 the technical complexity of issues and the expertise of the mechanism, and the distance in time and space from the alleged breach, raise different evidentiary concerns. In devising a mechanism for dispute settlement, generalisations based on the practice of tribunals should be therefore be drawn with caution.8” (Ronen, 2020, p. 3)

## Introduction

### The paper analyzes trends from the ICJ and other tribunals for evidentiary practices.

> “This paper draws primarily on the practice of the ICJ, but also considers the practice of other inter-state and non-inter-state tribunals. The relative uniformity and cross-fertilisation among them suggests that some general trends may be discerned. The differences between their practice and approach may assist in a more nuanced analysis of these trends.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 3)

## Introduction

### Attribution of state responsibility involves complex evidentiary questions linked to legality.

> “This paper is specifically concerned with the evidentiary questions as they pertain to attribution of state responsibility. These questions may arise for different purposes, not all of them legal. Even in a legal setting, proof of attribution may be required for different purposes, entailing different evidentiary standards.9 Specifically in the context of attribution of attacks, conventional or through cyber operations, the question has arisen whether the evidentiary requirements, in particular the standard of proof, would differ depending on whether the at issue is the legality of the alleged attack; or the legality of the response to it, in which case the attack is a fact that requires proof rather than a wrongful act in itself. If the requirements differ, it is not obvious in which of the cases the standards should be higher.10 The ICJ’s practice suggests that the standard would not differ.11 The same approach emerges from scholarly work12 and from the Tallinn 2.0 Manual, which links the standard of proof to the severity of the breach to which a victim state contemplates a response, rather than to whether the question arises before a response or retrospectively in Court. However, according to the Manual, the reasonableness of the state’s assessment whether the relevant standard has been met has to be evaluated by reference to the circumstances in which its decision was taken. This assessment depends on such factors as reliability, quantum, directness, nature and specificity of the relevant available information when considered in light of the attendant circumstances and the importance of the right involved.13” (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)

## Introduction

### The relationship between burden of proof, standard of proof, and evidence is crucial and interconnected.

> “While this paper discusses burden of proof, standard of proof and evidence separately of each other, these issues are interrelated.14 For example, difficulties in meeting the burden of proof may be alleviated by factual presumptions and a liberal approach to evidence admissibility.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)

## Burden of proof

### International courts generally lack explicit provisions on the burden of proof.

> “The constitutive documents of international courts and tribunals and their rules of procedure and evidence rarely contain explicit provisions on the burden of proof. The Ethiopia-Eritrea Claims Commission’s Rules of Procedure state that ‘[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the fact it relies on to support its claim or defence’.15 The same stipulation is provided in UNCITRAL Rule 24(3), which was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (IUSCT). It is common practice among international other courts and tribunals that a party bears the burden of proving the facts that it relies on for its submissions.16 This allocation is based on the presumption of compliance. In the context of international law, this presumption can be embodied in the fundamental norm pacta sunt servanda, to the effect that that states not only should carry out their obligations in good faith, but are presumed to be doing so.17 It is therefore an assertion to the contrary that requires proof.18 Placing the burden of proving a fact on the party alleging it means that within the same proceedings each party bears the burden with regards to different facts,19 depending on the subject-matter and on the nature of the dispute.20” (Ronen, 2020, p. 4)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### Reversal of the burden of proof has been historically rejected due to evidence possession.

> “A shift (or reversal) of the burden of proof from the party alleging a fact to its adversary has been proposed in a number of contexts. One is when the ordinary location of the burden gives a party some unfair advantage over the other.21 A situation where this may be the case is when the evidence is in the exclusive territorial possession of a party. In the Corfu Channel case (1949) the UK argued that its inability to obtain evidence because of Albania’s control over the territory in which the events had taken place justified the reversal of the burden of proof, onto Albania. The Court rejected this argument.22 It similarly rejected the United States’ contention in the Avena Case (2004) that it was for Mexico to produce information on the US nationality of certain individuals, a contention made on the ground that the facts on which such nationality depended were in Mexico’s hands.23 The WTO has also not been prepared to accept that relative ease of access to pertinent information determines the allocation of the burden.24” (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### Shifting the burden of proof can ensure accurate judicial determinations.

> “Other proposed grounds for a shift or reversal of the burden of proof are when that is perceived as the best way to ensure that the adjudicative body has the most accurate picture of the facts upon which to make judicial determinations. This rationale calls for placing the burden of proof on the better-informed party.25 It emphasises the inquisitorial character of the adjudicative process.26” (Ronen, 2020, p. 5)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### Judicial support exists for burden reversal in allegations of negative facts.

> “One basis for reversal of the burden of proof that has received some judicial support is where the allegation is of a negative fact. The argument is that the respondent to such an allegation is in a superior position to prove its compliance with law through its positive action,27 and a negative fact may be impossible to prove. In the Diallo case (2010) the ICJ recognised that when the victim of an alleged violation is alleging the breach of the law through omission, the respondent state can be required to provide evidence of its active conduct in compliance with the law. The Court clarified, however, that ‘it cannot be inferred in every case where the Respondent is unable to prove the performance of a procedural obligation that it has disregarded it: that depends to a large extent on the precise nature of the obligation in question ... The time which has elapsed since the events must also be taken into account’.28” (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### The ECtHR allows burden shifts in enforced disappearance cases based on state control.

> “It has been suggested that the ECtHR has adopted the principle on the shift of burden specifically with regard to claims of enforced disappearance. The Court has stated that ‘where persons are found injured or dead, or who have disappeared, in an area within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State and there is prima facie evidence that the State may be involved, the burden of proof may also shift to the Government since the events in issue may lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities’.29 According to the Court, The onus moves to the respondent government to provide a plausible explanation of what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty. Actually, this is not a shift of the burden of proof, since at issue is no longer the same question. The respondent state is required to rebut the factual presumption following from the applicant’s established claim.30 Admittedly, when a respondent does not offer proof to rebut the factual claim underlying a presumption, the differences between rebuttal of a presumption and a shift in the burden is very slight.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### Human rights tribunals justify burden shifts to address disparities in disputes.

> “Human rights tribunals are a forum where both rationales for shifting the burden (or using presumptions that alleviate it) are relevant. First, the dispute before the tribunal is between a state and an individual, a situation in which disparities in power and resources is immense. Second, while the process is adversarial, the purpose of human rights tribunals is not merely to resolve the particular dispute but to provide relevant and effective guidance to respondent states.31 Therefore not only levelling the playing field is important, but also ensuring that the tribunal has the most comprehensive and accurate information.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 6)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### States have a duty to collaborate in evidence provision to mitigate proof burden.

> “The maintenance of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact, irrespective of this party’s access to information is somewhat mitigated by the general duty that states are said to bear, to collaborate in good faith for the administration of evidence.32 This duty includes the obligation to provide information necessary for the establishment of the facts of the case and for the proper administration of justice more generally.33” (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### The ICJ endorses the duty of collaboration for evidence in dispute resolution.

> “The duty of collaboration has been endorsed by the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case (2010). The Court noted that ‘the Applicant should, in the first instance, submit the relevant evidence to substantiate its claims. This does not, however, mean that the Respondent should not co-operate in the provision of such evidence as may be in its possession that could assist the Court in resolving the dispute submitted to it’.34 In the Argentina–Footwear case the WTO panel stated that the very idea of the peaceful settlement of international disputes by adjudication is founded on the notion of co-operation between the parties, and that to this end there existed a ‘rule of collaboration’ which obligates parties to provide the tribunal with evidence that is in their sole possession.35” (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### Risks exist for parties to misuse collaboration duties for fishing expeditions in evidence requests.

> “There is a risk that parties may attempt to rely on the duty of collaboration to conduct a fishing expedition, by speculatively requesting broad categories of information from their adversaries without specifying how it would aid the resolution of the dispute, in order to procure evidence to bolster their own case. Accordingly, modalities for abuse of the process are required.36” (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)

## Burden of proof:Reversal of the burden of proof

### International courts typically maintain that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact.

> “In conclusion, notwithstanding the paucity of explicit provisions, the common practice of international courts and tribunals is to assume that the burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact. This burden may shift in part to the other party in exceptional circumstances, although practice to this effect is rare.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 7)

## Burden of proof:Burden of proof in the cyber operation context

### The proposal to reverse the burden of proof in attributing cyber operations stems from their transnational nature.

> “The transnational character of cyber operations requires the collection of evidence in the territory of other countries. The difficulty involved in this has led various commentators to suggest that the burden of proof should be reversed. Antonopoulos proposes that when an injurious cyber operation can be traced to the territory of a single state, the operation should be attributed to that state on the basis of a presumption of responsibility which that state may rebut.37 Margulies proposes a ‘virtual control’ test for attribution, under which the burden of proof shifts to a state to demonstrate it was not responsible for a cyber attack when it funds and equips a private entity or individual who subsequently engages in a cyber attack. This approach combines a change in evidentiary rules alongside a modification of the rule of attribution, from ‘effective’ to ‘virtual’ control.38 As noted above, the ICJ has rejected territorial control as grounds for shifting the burden of proof. Moreover, a shift of burden of these types would require the state to which the operation has been attributed to prove negative facts.39 This creates a different challenge, which, as noted above, is itself regarded as a basis for a shift of the burden.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)

## The standard of proof

### The standard of proof varies based on the context and criteria involved.

> “The standard of proof is the degree of conviction which a tribunal must feel before it decides that an alleged fact in issue has been established. It may vary according to different criteria. The present analysis focuses on the standard of proof required for establishing the international responsibility of a state for a wrongful act, as opposed, for example, for determining boundaries or allocating resources.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### Establishing state responsibility requires proof of both breach and attribution.

> “As noted at the outset, the finding that a state is responsible for an internationally wrong requires establishing the facts substantiating a claim that a primary rule of international has been breached; and the facts substantiating attribution of the breach to a state, namely the identity of the perpetrator of the breach, and the relationship between that person and the state. A preliminary question that may arise is whether the same standard applies to all components of the attribution, or whether proof of the breach and proof of the relationship of the person with the state are governed by different evidentiary rules. A subsequent question is what is (or are) the standard(s) of proof.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### The Corfu Channel case established a high standard of proof in attributing responsibility.

> “The case most often cited as establishing the existence of an objective (if elusive) standard of proof in the ICJ is the Corfu Channel case (1949). When examining the evidence for the UK’s contention that Albania had colluded with Yugoslavia in laying the minefield, the Court stated that a ‘charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here’.40 The Corfu Channel case actually revolved around attribution (in that case, through complicity). Subsequent cases in the ICJ and elsewhere refer to it with regard to proving both attributability and the breach, making no distinction between the two.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 8)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### The ICJ specified that the same standard of proof applies to both breach and attribution in the Bosnia Genocide case.

> “The first (and only) time that the ICJ mentioned proof of the breach and attribution as two distinct issues was in the Bosnia Genocide case (2007). After determining the standard of proof to be applied to the allegations of acts enumerated in Article III of the Genocide Convention,41 the Court added that ‘[t]he same standard applies to the proof of attribution for such acts’. It thus gave a clear response that within a specific dispute, proofs of the breach and its attribution were governed by the same standard.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 9)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### Scholarly debate exists regarding the standard of proof for attribution in the Bosnia Genocide case.

> “There has been considerable scholarly debate on the Court’s choice in the Bosnia Genocide case to apply the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard for proving violations of Article III of the Genocide Convention.42 However, the Court’s statement that the standard of proof relating to the breach also attaches to the proof of attributability has received little attention.43 Exceptionally, Milanovic argues that attribution, as a legal operation regulated by secondary norms, should be unaffected by the nature of the primary rules concerned.44 This view is supported by the preparatory work of the Articles on Responsibility of State for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA). In its 1974 report on the draft articles, the International Law Commission (ILC) emphasised that in order to establish international responsibility based on the conduct of persons acting on behalf of the state (then Draft Article 8, roughly corresponding to existing Articles 8 and 9), ‘it must be genuinely proved that the person or group of persons were actually appointed by organs of the State’.45 Whatever may be the precise meaning of ‘genuinely proved’, it is important that the Commission set it as the standard for proving attributability, not suggesting that this standard is in any way related to the proof of the breach of the primary rule. In the commentary to the final draft, the ILC noted that questions of evidence and proof of the breach fall entirely outside the scope of the draft articles.46 It did not regard the proof of the breach and the proof of attribution as connected to each other.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 9)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### Ethiopia Claims Commission clarified that the severity of allegations does not modify evidentiary standards.

> “Reservations about linking the standard of proof for attribution with the for the breach may have also been voiced by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission. The Commission addressed the suggestion that because the claims may involve allegations of potentially criminal individual conduct, a particularly high standard of proof should apply, corresponding to that applicable in criminal proceedings against individuals. The Commission rejected this suggestion, stating that ‘The possibility that particular findings may involve very serious matters does not change the international law rules to be applied or fundamentally transform the quantum of evidence required’.47 This statement suggests a principled stance, whereby the severity of the primary rules allegedly breached does not affect the evidentiary requirements. This broad statement is nonetheless mitigated (perhaps even contradicted) in the preceding paragraph, where the Commission explicitly agrees with both parties that ‘Particularly in light of the gravity of some of the claims advanced, the Commission will require clear and convincing evidence in support of its findings’.48 A similar ambiguity exists in the separate opinion of Judge Gaja in the ICJ’s Croatia Genocide case (2015), who relied on the Commission’s view.49” (Ronen, 2020, p. 10)

## The standard of proof:Proving attributability and proving the breach

### Milanovic suggests a 'convincing and credible' standard for attribution, yet ICJ links it to breach standards.

> “Milanovic proposes ‘convincing and credible’ as a standard of proof for attributability of a wrongful act to a state.50 However, as noted above, the ICJ has expressly linked the standard of proof for attribution with the standard of proof for the breach. The majority of commentators have followed the ICJ’s approach.51 The standard itself (applicable within each case to both issues) is, as the following discussion indicates, a sliding scale.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 10)

## The standard of proof:The existence of a scale of standards

### The ICJ's case law features multiple standards of proof, affecting clarity in legal proceedings.

> “The ICJ’s case law mentions numerous standards of proof: ‘too improbable’,52 ‘consistent with the probabilities’,53 proof ‘to the Court’s satisfaction’,54 ‘sufficient certainty’,55 ‘a degree of certainty’,56 'decisive legal proof’,57 ‘firm conclusion’,58 ‘conclusive’ evidence,59 ‘evidence that is fully conclusive’,60 ‘the most credible and probative evidence’,61 ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’,62 ‘beyond possibility of reasonable doubt’,63 ‘no reasonable doubt’,64 ‘little reasonable doubt’,65 and ‘no room for reasonable doubt’.66 Some of these terms appear synonymous (eg ‘conclusive evidence’ and ‘evidence that is fully conclusive’), especially when they appear within the same judgment; their relative strength is nonetheless difficult to ascertain. In other cases, the Court does not indicate the standard that it applies, confining itself to statements such as that ‘the burden of proof... has not been discharged’.67 In some instances it may not even be clear whether the term used by the Court designates a specific standard or simply the existence of a standard that has not been met. Such is the case when the Court states that the evidence is ‘insufficient’ to prove the allegations,68 that the applicant ‘has not provided the Court with adequate evidence’,69 or that the information before the Court ‘does not, however, suffice to establish with the requisite certainty’ the facts substantiating attributability.70” (Ronen, 2020, p. 11)

## The standard of proof:The existence of a scale of standards

### Different evidentiary standards might be necessitated by the severity of allegations in legal cases.

> “The use of these ostensibly disparate terms may not be entirely without rhyme or reason; it may be that different standards apply in different cases. The notion of a variable standard was implied as early as in the Corfu Channel case. When examining the evidence for the UK’s contention that Albania had colluded with Yugoslavia in laying the minefield, the Court stated that a ‘charge of such exceptional gravity against a State would require a degree of certainty that has not been reached here’.71 It thus implied that the standard of proof should correspond to the ‘gravity’ of the charge. Subsequent cases referred to a gravity scale as a matter of existing law,72 although neither the ‘notches’ on the scale nor the corresponding standard of proof were identified. One exception is the Bosnia Genocide case (2007), where the Court not only reiterated the doctrine73 but also required different levels of proof to different types of allegations. Even then it did not explain its choice.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 12)

## The standard of proof:The existence of a scale of standards

### Various legal domains employ distinct standards of proof, hinting at the need for a similar approach in international law.

> “It is common practice in domestic law that different standards of proof apply in different areas of law: ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ in criminal law, ‘balance of probabilities’ in civil law, etc. The different standards correspond to the different legal consequences that each body of law carries. International law pertaining to state responsibility does not divide into the same categories, but different types of internationally wrongful do carry different consequences. There may is therefore be merit in a scale that reflects these differences.74” (Ronen, 2020, p. 12)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Doctrine

### The ICJ has not defined the criteria determining the gravity of unlawful acts.

> “The ICJ has not clarified what it is that determines ‘gravity’. The gravity of charges or allegations could refer to the gravity of the norm that has allegedly been breached. While there is no general hierarchy of primary rules, international law does distinguish peremptory norms from other norms, including with regard to state responsibility. Serious breaches of peremptory norms (ie those that involve a gross or systematic failure by the responsible state to fulfil its obligations)75 create obligations for third parties of cooperation in bringing the breach to an end, and of non-recognition.76” (Ronen, 2020, p. 12)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Doctrine

### The legal response to a breach of norms varies by the severity of the violation.

> “A different distinction among norms that is also related to the legal consequences of a breach concerns the response that states are entitled to take when they are victims of a breach. According to the Tallinn Manual, for example, the severity of the potential response to the breach calls for a high standard of proof.77A different approach examines gravity by reference to the actual response. According to this approach, a state which claims to have been a victim of an attack would need to meet a lower standard of proof if it seeks to take non-forcible countermeasures than if it invokes the right to self defence, and an even lower standard when it only claims to be a victim.78” (Ronen, 2020, p. 13)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Doctrine

### Gravity may also depend on the extent of harm caused by a violation.

> “There may be other criteria for gravity, that depend on the circumstances of the specific violation, such as the extent of the harm caused by a breach. Gravity of the harm often underpins the gravity of the breach. Therefore a scale of gravity of the norm and a scale of gravity of the harm are likely to correspond. They may nonetheless diverge. The Corfu Channel case demonstrates this: the formal charge in that case was (only) the violation of the right to innocent passage, but the consequences of the violation in the circumstances were extensive death and destruction, comparable to the consequences of an illegal use of force. The differentiation between norm and harm is also relevant with regard to cyber operations that are capable of causing significant and widespread (and potentially irreparable) harm, but through violation of a norm that might not be characterised as particularly grave.79 The difficulty in determining the standard of proof by reference to extent of the harm caused is that the harm itself requires proof. Harm therefore cannot serve as an objective indicator at the outset of proceedings.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 13)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Doctrine

### The potential political consequences of a judicial declaration affect the perceived gravity of a violation.

> “Gravity can also be reflected in the potential political fallout and perception in global public opinion following a judicial declaration that a state has violated the law.80 Arguably, the greater that potential for a negative political stigma, the stricter should be the evidentiary demands for the judicial findings.81 The opprobrium attaching to a violation would in many cases derives from the character of the norm that had been violated, irrespective of the specific event.82” (Ronen, 2020, p. 13)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Practice

### The Court's Lack of Clarity on the Gravity of Charges in the Corfu Channel Case

> “In the Corfu Channel case, where the notion of gravity was introduced, the Court did not clarify the specific gravity of the charge. Following the criteria discussed above, the gravity seems to have lain in the harm that has been caused as a result of the breach, rather than in the norm itself.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 14)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Practice

### Judge Higgins Critiques the Lack of Standard of Proof Transparency in the Oil Platforms Case

> “Later case law sheds little light on the matter. In the Oil Platforms case (2003) Judge Higgins opined that ‘[e]ven if the Court does not wish to enunciate a general standard for non-criminal cases, it should in my view have decided, and been transparent about, the standard of proof required in this particular case’.83 Judge Higgins did not explain the reference to criminal cases. It may have been be related to the fact that by 2003 the Court had on its docket the Bosnia Genocide case, where allegations were made of state responsibility for conduct that also creates individual criminal responsibility. Judge Higgins did imply, in any case, that criminality could be a factor in determining the standard of proof.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 14)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Practice

### The Bosnia Genocide Case Highlights Distinctions in Standards of Proof for Different Allegations

> “The distinction between the standard of proof for proving allegations of conduct that also creates criminal responsibility and the standard of proof applicable to other allegations may indeed have been adopted in the Bosnia Genocide case. The Court distinguished the standard applicable to the crime of genocide and other acts enumerated in Article III of the Genocide Convention84 from that which is applicable to allegations of failure to prevent genocide and punish and extradite persons charged with genocide.85 However, it is not clear that the criminality of the conduct was the sole factor in the Court’s statement. The Court explicitly linked the ‘exceptional gravity’ which it associated with the Article III allegations with the Corfu Channel case’s doctrine, which did not involve criminal conduct. Article III allegations may have been distinguished from the other allegations because they concern prohibitions that are regarded as peremptory norms.86” (Ronen, 2020, p. 14)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Practice

### Judge Kooijmans Advocates for a High Standard of Proof in Use of Force Cases to Ensure Legal Compliance

> “In the Oil Platforms case (2003) Judge Kooijmans regarded the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard, commonly associated with criminal responsibility, as required to attribute use of force, noting that ‘probabilities or even near certainties do not suffice’. Judge Kooijmans did not specify why in his view ‘the use of force must be subjected to a strict legality test’.87 This could be both because the prohibition on the use of force is a peremptory norm and because the victim of the violation may be entitled to respond through use of force.88” (Ronen, 2020, p. 15)

## The standard of proof:The meaning of gravity:Practice

### Case Law Provides Limited Guidance on the Meaning of 'Gravity' in Setting Standards of Proof for Cyber Operations

> “In conclusion, the case law offers little guidance as to meaning of 'gravity’ which would govern the standard of proof. The various proposed criteria are likely to all pull in the same direction, but there may be exceptions. Cyber operations may be a case in point.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 15)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### International judicial practice lacks clarity on gravity but identifies three standards of proof.

> “While international judicial practice is silent on what constitutes ‘gravity’, it is only slightly more revealing on the standards of proof that may apply. Three main standards have been expressly invoked: proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’, ‘clear and convincing’ evidence and ‘preponderance’ of evidence.89” (Ronen, 2020, p. 15)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### The ICJ defines conclusive evidence as a necessity in exceptional gravity cases.

> “In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ found that the burden of proof regarding collusion between Albania and Yugoslavia had not been met, since the evidence was not ‘conclusive’ or led to ‘no firm conclusion’.90 Later, when discussing the admissibility and weight of indirect evidence, the Court stated that ‘proof may be drawn from inferences of fact, provided that they leave no room for reasonable doubt’.91 These statements have been interpreted to mean that ‘conclusiveness’ and ‘no reasonable doubt’ are synonymous terms. This is the common understanding following the Bosnia Genocide case (2007). In that case the Court relied on the Corfu Channel case to hold, with regard to acts enumerated in Article III of the Genocide Convention), that ‘claims against a State involving charges of exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive’.92 When implementing this standard the Court referred to facts that had not been ‘conclusively established’,93 or had ‘not been established beyond any doubt’ because they were ‘not conclusively shown’.94 President Higgins later confirmed that ‘conclusiveness’ and absence of ‘reasonable doubt’ were comparable terms.95” (Ronen, 2020, p. 15)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### The ECtHR applied the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard in significant human rights cases.

> “The ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ has also featured in other judicial proceedings. The European Commission and the European Court of Human rights (ECtHR) applied this standard in the Greek Case (1969) (alleging an administrative practice of torture)96 and in the Ireland v UK case (1978) (alleging conduct constituting torture).97 The Court also enunciated this as the applicable standard in the Varnava v Turkey case (2009) (alleging conducting amount to enforced disappearances).98 One explanation for the choice of the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard may that all cases concerned systematic violations of non-derogable rights amounting to international crimes (although not ones susceptible in practice to prosecution in an international tribunal). However the Court itself had distanced itself from this interpretation in the Nachova case (2005) when it stated that it did not intend to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard, since its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but to ensure the observance by Contracting States’ of their obligation to secure rights under the Convention.99 A different explanation may be that the Court followed the civil law system, where full persuasion of the judge is required both in criminal and in civil cases.100” (Ronen, 2020, p. 16)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### Shelton argues that the high standard of proof is essential due to the political nature of interstate complaints.

> “Shelton suggests that the ECtHR’s recourse to the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard was influenced by the fact that interstate complaints are always suspect of political motivation, and therefore merit the highest standard of proof.101 However, in the Varnava case the 'beyond reasonable doubt’ standard was applied in the individual application, and the ECtHR rejected the proposed distinction.102” (Ronen, 2020, p. 16)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### Judge Cançado Trindad notes the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard has a distinct meaning in the ECHR context.

> “According to Judge Cançado Trindad, the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard as used by the ECHR was endowed with an autonomous meaning under the European Convention on Human Rights, less stringent than the one applied in national (criminal) proceedings.103 Indeed, while the ECtHR has not qualified the standard in any manner, the Court’s case law has identified situations in which the rigour of this rule may be mitigated,104 through the use of inferences and presumptions which might not be admissible in criminal cases.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### O’Connell suggests the prominence of the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard may have been overstated.

> “O’Connell argues that the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard has lost its prominence in the ECtHR, but the Varnava case suggests that this view may have been premature. That said, the Court did not actually require proof beyond reasonable doubt in that case. The Court held that it was ‘satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case’ that alleged victims of human rights violations had come under the control of Turkey.105 Other cases in the ECtHR explicitly applied a lower standard for the burden of proof. For example, in the Pakelli case (1983) the Court was ‘satisfied’ that the requirements under ECHR art 6 had been fulfilled even though the evidence was ‘not sufficient to prove beyond all doubt’ the applicant’s indigence.106” (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### The 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard has been applied in IUSCT judgments concerning criminal acts.

> “The ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard has also featured in some judgments of the IUSCT. Notably, it concerned the proof of forgery and bribery,107 allegations of conduct amounting to criminal acts, albeit under domestic law.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Beyond reasonable doubt

### Application of the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard varies based on the nature of the allegations.

> “The cases in which the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard was applied often involved allegations of violation of peremptory norms. But not every alleged violation of a peremptory norm would necessary entail application of this standard. This is evident in the fact that judgments on the illegal use of force employ not the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard but a lower one, as discussed below.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Clear and convincing evidence

### The Trail Smelter Case established the necessity of clear and convincing evidence for state responsibility.

> “In the Trail Smelter Case (1941) the arbitral tribunal held that ‘no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in a manner as to cause injury ... to the territory of another .... when the case is of serious consequence and the injury is established by clear and convincing evidence’.108” (Ronen, 2020, p. 17)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Clear and convincing evidence

### The ICJ prefers 'clear and convincing' evidence over mere preponderance in its rulings.

> “In some cases the Court explicitly uses the ‘clear and convincing’ terminology. In Congo v Uganda (2005) it stated it has not received ‘convincing’ evidence that Ugandan forces were present in certain locations in the period under consideration.109 With regard to other cases, such as the Oil Platforms case (2003) and the Nicaragua case (1986), O’Connell infers that the ICJ favored the ‘clear and convincing’ standard from the fact that it demanded more than mere preponderance of the evidence to support claims of the United States that it acted in self-defense, but did not require the United States had to provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The Ethiopia-Eritrea Commission noted that ‘it is clear from the evidence that these incidents involved geographically limited clashes’.110” (Ronen, 2020, p. 18)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Clear and convincing evidence

### O’Connell suggests 'clear and convincing' is an emerging standard in international law for self-defense justification.

> “O’Connell claims that ‘clear and convincing’ is an emerging general standard under international law, including or especially with regard to justification of the use of force in self defence.111 In addition to judicial decisions she relies on numerous US statements given outside judicial proceedings, which consistently refer to ‘compelling’ or ‘convincing’ evidence as grounds for decisions whether to respond by force to alleged acts of terrorism.112” (Ronen, 2020, p. 18)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Clear and convincing evidence

### O’Connell and Henkin advocate a high standard of proof to prevent abuse of the right to self-defense.

> “O’Connell and Henkin furthermore advocate the ‘clear and convincing’ standard with regard to the use of force in self defence as a matter of policy, on the grounds that a high standard of proof is needed to counter the potential for abuse of the right to self defence.113 Lobel advocates the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ standard, at least in relation to a state seeking to justify the use of force in self defence (rather than in relation to determining state responsibility in judicial proceedings). He regards the lower standard as an undesirable but necessary concession. He argues that a determination of the standard must weigh the risk of harm both to the international community and to individuals from erroneous, unilateral judgments. The harm from indiscriminate use of force is immense compared with the harm of locking up a criminal. It is also irreversible, unlike deprivations of liberty.114 Lobel thus examines grativy in terms of the potential response.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 18)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Clear and convincing evidence

### The Velásquez Rodríguez case emphasizes the need for clear and convincing evidence for serious allegations.

> “In the Velásquez Rodríguez case (1988) the IACtHR reiterated that to reflect the ‘special seriousness’ of the allegations (regarding a policy of toleration of disappearances), the evidence should be ‘capable of establishing the truth of the allegations in a convincing manner’.115 This has been interpreted as a lower standard than ‘beyond reasonable doubt’.116 Similarly, the Ethiopia-Eritrea Commission held that ‘[p]articularly in light of the gravity of some of the claims advanced, the Commission will require clear and convincing evidence in support of its findings’.117 Amerasinghe nonetheless notes that there have been cases which used the ‘convincing’ standard interchangeably with ‘beyond reasonable doubt’.118 He suggests that this interchangeability also underpins the Velásquez Rodríguez case.119 Since the exact meaning of that standard ultimately depends on how each particular tribunal views the matter, arguably the formal distinctions might be largely semantic120 Shelton considers that the ‘clear and convincing’ standard is appropriate where systematic and serious violations of human rights are alleged in individual petitions.121” (Ronen, 2020, p. 19)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Preponderance of evidence

### The 'preponderance of evidence' is the common standard in international litigation, though not applied by the ICJ.

> “‘Preponderance of evidence’ generally means that there is evidence greater in weight in comparison with the evidence adduced by the other party on the basis of reasonable probability rather than possibility. Various commentators hold that the standard of proof most commonly used in international litigation is that of preponderance of evidence.122 However, ICJ case law relating to state responsibility does not apply this standard. It has been used in the IUSCT,123 and has been mentioned or proposed – but has not been the basis for ruling – in a number of separate opinions and dissents.124” (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)

## The standard of proof:The standards:Preponderance of evidence

### Higher evidentiary standards may apply to more serious violations, suggesting 'preponderance of evidence' could suit lower gravity cyber operation allegations.

> “Notably, the case law in which a specific standard was applied, namely ‘clear and convincing evidence’, concerned alleged violations of the prohibition on the use of force. Just as a higher standard is applicable in some cases of even greater gravity, it may be that the ‘preponderance of evidence’ would be deemed appropriate in cases of lower gravity.125 This may be appropriate for attribution of cyber operations that allegedly violate norms lower down the gravity scale than the use of force. Such may be the case when the allegation is only of a violation of the prohibition on non-interference or of the prohibition on violation of state sovereignty.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### Cyber operations complicate perpetrator identification.

> “The need to prove identity and conduct with regard to cyber operations presents novel evidentiary challenges, as the internet was never designed for tracking and tracing users. Perpetrators can easily obscure their true location. Isolating the origin of cyber operations is also difficult when they are routed through multiple machines in multiple locations. There is always the chance that supposed hints included within the code are intentionally misleading. These challenges make the task of establishing a forensic link between a perpetrator and an incident extremely difficult. Thus, cyber operations often take longer to detect and evaluate than traditional kinetic conduct.126” (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### Proposals suggest lowering the standard of proof for cyber operations.

> “In light of these characteristics, proposals have been put forward to relax the ordinary standard of proof so as not to make the proof of responsibility for cyber operations unfeasible. 127 Specifically when at issue is a potential response to an attack through use of force, it has been argued that the time it will realistically take to correctly identify the perpetrator will make it significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of self-defense.128” (Ronen, 2020, p. 20)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### Attribution is essential for lawful self-defense actions.

> “Some have suggested to do away with attribution altogether.129 However, attribution is not a formality. Without attribution, against whom would the conduct in self defense be directed?130” (Ronen, 2020, p. 21)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### The standard of proof safeguards against false attribution.

> “At first glance, there seems no obvious reason why the standard of proof should be lowered simply because it is more difficult to meet. The standard of proof exists not to disadvantage the claimant, but to protect the respondent against false attribution.131 That said, the very notion of ‘standard of proof’ constitutes a compromise between absolute certainty and practicality. The standards themselves reflect primarily the gravity of the breach, but they are also underpinned by some perception of what type and level of proof can be realistically demanded.132 As the type of acts that need to be proven, and the means of proving them, evolve to new realms, this perception may need adaptation; the proposition that the standards might need modification is not entirely misplaced.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 21)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### Lowering the standard of proof risks misattribution and conflict escalation.

> “There may nonetheless be other considerations. For example, adoption of categorically distinct standards assumes that cyber operations and conventional ones can be distinguished from each other. This is not the case even today. With time, the differentiation between physical space and cyberpace will become impossible. Moreover, the challenge of responding quickly in the absence of clear and unambiguous information is not unique to cyber operations. As technological capabilities advance, the perceived gap between cyber forensics and kinetic forensics may also grow smaller.133 Lowering the standard carries a risk of misattribution, which has particularly grave consequences in relation to cyber armed attacks, where a state may retaliate in self-defense. Failing to maintain strict attribution requirements also gives rise to a significant risk of escalation and conflict.134” (Ronen, 2020, p. 21)

## The standard of proof:Application to cyber operations

### Cyber operations may require adaptable legal standards based on their nature.

> “While a categorically distinct standard of proof may not be desirable or practical, the character of the operation may itself inform the standard of proof. An emerging phenomenon is cyber operations that implicate primary rules that have traditionally not received much judicial attention, such as the prohibition on intervention and the prohibition on violation of sovereignty. These norms are regarded as less grave than the prohibition on the use of force, and therefore the standard applicable to them might be lower than the ‘clear and convincing’ or ‘conclusive’ standard. Needless to say, cyber operations do not by definition fall below any gravity threshold. Indeed, they may amount to use of force under certain circumstances, in which the standard would apply. The present discussion merely highlights that cyber operations may be novel in that they bring to the adjudication arena primary norms that have not been adjudicated previously, with their adjoining burden of proof.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 22)

## Means of proof of evidence:Admissibility of  evidence

### The ICJ's liberal approach allows broad admissibility of evidence.

> “The rules of procedure of international courts and tribunals generally do not place constraints on admissibility of evidence. ICJ practice has been very liberal, with a preference to admitting all evidence and distinguishing it according to probative value and reliability. This approach was explained by ICJ Former President Rosalyn Higgins on the ground that ‘[t]he parties are entitled to expect that we will examine every single thing that they put before us, and we do’.135 The respect for state sovereignty which this approach reflects is ingrained in the ICJ’s procedure.136 It might be less determinative in the procedure of other dispute settlement mechanisms.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 22)

## Means of proof of evidence:Admissibility of  evidence

### ICJ establishes key factors for evaluating documentary evidence's probative value.

> “Alongside the liberal policy of admissibility, through the case law the ICJ has established principles on the relative probative value and reliability that it would attach to different categories of evidence.137 The factors that the Court has clarified for assessing the relevance and probative value of documentary evidence have been summarised as follows.138 • Sources: whether the sources are partisan or independent, and whether they are corroborated by other evidence.139 Interest: whether the source of the evidence has an interest in the conduct of proceedings, or is neutral and indifferent, and whether the evidence contains any admissions against the interest of the party submitting it.140 • Relation to events: whether the evidence records direct observation or hearsay. 141 • Method: the means and methodology by which the information presented has been collected. • Verification: evidence will be considered to be more valuable if it has been subject to crossexamination either during its compilation or subsequently, and if it is corroborated by other sources.142 • Contemporaneity: generally less weight attaches to evidence which was not prepared or given at a time close to the facts it purports to prove. Equally, more caution is due with respect to documents prepared specifically for the purposes of litigation.143 • Procedure: whether the evidence was correctly submitted in accordance with procedural requirements. In 2011 the Court introduced the concept of ‘legal significance’. It denied such significance (ie probative value) to documents based on of formality, authorship, inaction, attribution, and notice. This has been harshly criticized by Judge Simma.144” (Ronen, 2020, p. 23)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence

### International courts accept circumstantial evidence to address inequality of proof.

> “International courts and tribunals have been willing to accept circumstantial evidence and to rely on inferences and presumptions, so long as those lead to conclusions consistent with the facts and the contrary is not indicated by the record or is not compelled as a matter of law.145One justification for the use of indirect evidence is that it mitigates the inequality of arms which sometimes results from the preservation of the burden of proof on the party alleging a fact.146 When the required evidence is in the exclusive control of the state, and that state does not cooperate in bringing forth that evidence, the victim state would be allowed a more liberal recourse to circumstantial evidence, including inferences of fact.147” (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence

### Human rights tribunals justify indirect evidence due to power imbalances between individuals and states.

> “In human rights tribunals, an additional justifications for use of indirect evidence is the imbalance of power between the parties in cases based on individual applications. Individuals lack both the resources and the power of the defendant state.148 For example, in the Velásquez Rodríguez case the IACtHR noted that in cases of repression characterized by attempts to suppress information, circumstantial or presumptive evidence becomes especially important.149” (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Factual presumptions and inferences

### Factual presumptions allow legal parties to infer claims without direct proof.

> “A factual inference is the drawing of a factual conclusion from a fact already established. A factual presumption is an inference based on repeated practice. Factual presumptions relieve the reliant party from proving a fact it alleges but cannot prove directly, by relying on an inference from a fact that it can prove directly. When no evidence is presented against the presumption or inference, the other party is then required to disprove them.150” (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Factual presumptions and inferences

### The ICJ has utilized factual inferences in its case rulings.

> “The ICJ has made some use of inferences. It did so extensively in the Nicaragua case (1986), where the US did not participate in the proceedings and did not offer its own version of the facts.151 In the Bosnia Genocide case (2007) it opined that a pattern of conduct to be accepted as evidence of a specific intent to destroy the group in whole or in part, if that pattern is convincingly demonstrated to existand can only point to the existence of such intent.152 In contrast, in the Georgia v Russia case (2011) Judge Simma in a separate opinion strongly criticised the majority for factual using inferences that ‘undermine the Court’s responsibility to discharge its judicial function in a thorough manner by making full use of its fact-finding powers under Articles 49 to 51 of the Statute to avoid having to resort to such inferences in the first place’.153” (Ronen, 2020, p. 24)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Factual presumptions and inferences

### Human rights tribunals apply presumptions when evidence is within state control.

> “The IUSCT has made use of factual inferences.154 In the international human rights tribunals inferences and presumptions have played an important role. The ECtHR has held that where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries, death or disappearances occurring during such detention. The burden may then be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation for the disappearance.155 This is often referred to as a shift in the burden of proof, However, the presumption actually places the burden on the respondent party to provide evidence for other facts than the original allegation, rather than to prove the opposite of the fact claimed by the adversary.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 25)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Factual presumptions and inferences

### Silence by a state can be interpreted as acceptance of allegations in legal proceedings.

> “A specific inference that has been applied in courts and tribunal is the inference from silence acceptance of the veracity of factual claims when the adversary offers no denial.156 In the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case (1980) the ICJ noted the lack of denial by Iran and its silence in finding the allegations by the United States ‘well-founded’.157 In the Velásquez Rodríguez case (1988) the IACtHR held that a state’s silence or elusive response to allegations may be interpreted as acknowledgement of the allegations’ truth, so long as the contrary is not indicated by the record or is not compelled as a matter of law.158 The use of this presumption was not automatic. The Court linked its discretion whether to apply it to its ‘duty to evaluate the evidence as a whole’ and to the fact that a human rights Court is concerned not with allocating responsibility, but with protecting the rights of individuals.159 Thus the adversarial nature of the proceedings to establish the legal truth gives some way to the need to establish the factual truth. The presumption was incorporated as a mandatory provision in the IAComHR’s Rules of Procedure.160” (Ronen, 2020, p. 25)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Adverse inferences because of refusal to provide information

### Refusal to provide information may lead to adverse inferences by tribunals.

> “A party’s refusal to provide information that is in its exclusive possession may, in some instances, lead the tribunal to draw adverse inferences.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 25)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Adverse inferences because of refusal to provide information

### ICJ Statute allows courts to request documents, noting refusals but previous cases did not lead to adverse conclusions.

> “ICJ Statute Article 49 provides that the Court may call upon the parties to produce any document or to supply any explanations, and formal note shall be taken of a party’s refusal to do so. The Statute does not indicate of what the ‘note’ would consist. The opportunities to draw adverse inferences arose in Corfu Channel case when the UK refused to provide a document on grounds of naval secrecy, and in the Bosnia Genocide case. In both cases, the Court refrained from drawing adverse conclusions.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 26)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Adverse inferences because of refusal to provide information

### Bosnia's reliance on Article 49 was disregarded by the Court due to existing ample evidence.

> “In the Bosnia Genocide case Bosnia attempted to rely on Article 49 in light of Serbia’s refusal to provide full texts of certain documents.161 The Court declined to do so, stating that Bosnia has extensive documentation and other evidence available to it, especially from ICTY records, and it has made very ample use of it.162 Judge AI-Khasawneh in dissent criticised the majority for not drawing any conclusions from Serbia’s refusal.163” (Ronen, 2020, p. 26)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Adverse inferences because of refusal to provide information

### The authority to draw adverse inferences from refusals is explicit in some international contexts.

> “The power to draw adverse inferences from a refusal to provide information is explicit under instruments of some other courts and tribunals.164 Otherwise, it derives from the duty of collaboration in international adjudication.165” (Ronen, 2020, p. 26)

## Means of proof of evidence:Indirect evidence:Adverse inferences because of refusal to provide information

### Utilization of adverse inferences is rare in practice and is seen as a last resort by international tribunals.

> “Notwithstanding the power, adverse inferences from refusal to provide information have not often been utilised. This has been explained on the grounds that the main purpose of the duty to collaborate is to provide evidence, and sanctioning for failure or reasonable adverse inferences is neither the objective nor always possible. International tribunals therefore resort to steps such as making adverse inferences against a party only as a last resort and under special circumstances.166 Gattini holds that only an unjustified refusal by a party to produce documents as requested by the Court could justify adverse inferences, as only then is it a violation of the obligation to cooperate bona fide with the Court in the establishment of judicial truth,.167” (Ronen, 2020, p. 26)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Use of indirect evidence and inferences

### Indirect evidence can help establish attribution of cyber operations.

> “The proposition that the burden of proof should be alleviated by use of indirect evidence is particularly germane in proving cyber operations, a process which require access to information that is in the exclusive control of other states. Presumptions and inferences may also be applicable. Dederer and Singer, for example, suggest that when an operation has definitely been launched from a state’s computer system located within a state-owned or state-controlled facility, the victim state can be regarded as having conclusively established that the cyber operation is attributable to a state organ within the meaning of ARSIWA Article 4. This inference would be possible if the victim state proves that only public officials working in, or having access to the state facility could have initiated the cyber operation and did so in an official capacity.168 The Tallinn 2.0 Manual take an opposite view. The Manual notes that while traditionally, the use of governmental assets has constituted a nearly irrefutable indication of attribution due to the improbability of their use by persons other than state organs, when it comes to cyber operations, another state or entity may have acquired control over the infrastructure and is using it to conduct cyber operations. Therefore it is precisely the characteristic of cyber operations that render the inference misplaced.169” (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Digital evidence

### Digital evidence can be significant but is often overlooked in international law.

> “Proving cyber operations may involve the use of novel types of evidence. Given the liberal approach of courts and tribunals to admission of evidence, this novelty does not in itself seem to present particular challenges. For example, there is likely to be a significant amount of digital evidence. The use of such evidence in inter-state litigation has been almost entirely neglected by international law scholarship, with the exception of studies of the use of digital evidence before criminal tribunals.170” (Ronen, 2020, p. 27)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Digital evidence

### Digital evidence alone is insufficient to establish state responsibility for cyber operations.

> “Roscini suggests that digital evidence is unlikely to play, on its own, a decisive role in establishing state responsibility for cyber operations. It is volatile, has a short life span, and is frequently located in foreign countries. Collecting it is time consuming and requires cooperation from relevant internet service providers, which may be particularly difficult to obtain when the attack originates from other states. In any case, digital evidence will likely lead to proving of only one element in the chain of attribution, namely identification of the computer or computer system from which the cyber operation originates. It would not necessarily identify the individuals responsible for the cyber operation and would say nothing about the relationship between that person and a state.171” (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Digital evidence

### Reluctance to reveal sources of digital evidence may compromise its acceptance in court.

> “A characteristic of digital evidence is that parties may be particularly reluctant to reveal the sources and procedures through which they had obtained the evidence it has submitted. While there are no sanctions for this, the litigating party bears the risk that the evidence is excluded or given reduced weight and that the facts it claims will not be considered sufficiently proved,172 due to the inability to establish the authenticity, accuracy and completeness of the evidence.173” (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Illegally obtained evidence

### Collecting evidence for state responsibility in cyber operations may violate international norms.

> “Collection of evidence to prove state responsibility for cyber operations may involve violation of various norms: cyber espionage may constitute a violation of state sovereignty;174 international human rights and specifically the right to privacy are also likely to be implicated. This renders the question on the admissibility of illegal obtained evidence highly pertinent.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Illegally obtained evidence

### The ICJ has not explicitly excluded illegally obtained evidence in its rulings.

> “The question of admissibility could have arisen in a few cases where at issue was evidence that had been obtained illegally. The ICJ has never specifically rejected such evidence. In the Corfu Channel case the UK submitted evidence acquired, despite Albanian protest, through minesweeping operations in Albanian waters. The Court did not exclude the evidence. The reason may be that Albania did not challenge its admissibility; or it may be the general policy described above, of regarding flaws in the evidence as a factor for weighing it rather than for its exclusion.175” (Ronen, 2020, p. 28)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Illegally obtained evidence

### The rationale for inadmissibility of illegally obtained evidence differs in interstate litigation compared to domestic law.

> “According to Roscini, the rationale for the inadmissibility of illegally obtained evidence in domestic legal system, namely the need to protect a defendant against abuse of power, is inapplicable in interstate litigation, where there is formal equality between the parties. Commentators hold that evidence obtained by breach of peremptory norms should be considered inadmissibility.176 Otherwise, the probative weight of the collected evidence will also not depend on whether it was collected legally, but on the demonstration of its authenticity and accuracy. At the same time, presentation of evidence collected illegally would expose the state relying on it being called to account for its own wrongful act.177” (Ronen, 2020, p. 29)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Privileged information

### The ICJ has not recognized national security as a privilege in evidence provision.

> “Both in the Corfu Channel case and in the Bosnia Genocide case, the respondent states refused to submit evidence on grounds of national security. In the Corfu Channel case the evidence was to be produced under a Court order. In the Bosnia Genocide case the Court refused to give a similar order upon a Bosnian request. In neither case did the Court draw any adverse conclusions from the refusals (as it is empowered to do under its Statute).178 At the same time it did not say that the material was privileged. Accordingly, it is difficult to conclude that the ICJ’s procedure recognises a privilege for national security interests.179” (Ronen, 2020, p. 29)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Privileged information

### Other tribunals have enforced compliance with evidence requests despite national security claims.

> “Other tribunals have been less deferential to states’ positions and have requested information that was sensitive and confidential, and respondent states have complied with the requests, with the documents examined in camera. In Cyprus v Turkey the requested state refused to comply with the request, the EComHR reported it to the competent political body.180” (Ronen, 2020, p. 29)

## Evidentiary issues in the context of cyber operations:Privileged information

### The ICTY prohibits states from withholding evidence on national security grounds while allowing practical accommodations.

> “The ICTY took an explicit stance on the matter, holding that states are not allowed to withhold documents and other evidentiary material requested by the Tribunal on the claim of national security interests, as this would undermine the very raison d’être of the Tribunal. It did, however, propose practical arrangements to make allowance for legitimate and bona fide concerns of states. These include taking account of whether the state concerned has acted and is acting bona fide; scrutiny of the documents by a single judge of the tribunal in camera and in ex parte proceedings, and with no transcripts made. Documents that the judge eventually considers required for the proceedings may be redacted by the state providing them. The ICTY was also willing to make allowances where a state acting bona fide would consider ‘one or two particular documents’ so delicate from a national security point of view compared to their relevance to the proceedings that it would prefer not to submit them even to a judge. As a minimum, the state would be required to submit an affidavit by a responsible officer describing the documents and the precise grounds for the desire to withhold them. This affidavit would be considered in camera. If the judge is not satisfied that the reasons adduced by the state are valid and persuasive, the tribunal may make a judicial finding of non-compliance, which would bear the consequences under the tribunal’s rules.181 Similar arrangements could be adopted also in cases of invocation of national security in adjudicating responsibility for cyber operations.” (Ronen, 2020, p. 30)
