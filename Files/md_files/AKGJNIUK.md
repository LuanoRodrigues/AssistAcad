# <h1>Countermeasures against Cyber Operations: Moving forward?</h1>

## 1 Introduction

### International legal order lacks centralized enforcement authority.

> “International legal order, in contrast to national legal systems, lacks the superior authority responsible for the enforcement of legal obligations owed by its subjects.2 Enforcement is mostly decentralized and states have to rely on measures of self-help, spanning from mere retorsion (an unfriendly, but legal act) to the use of force in self-defense.3 Somewhere in between these two extremes lie countermeasures, defined by the International Law Commission (hereinafter “ILC”) as acts “that would otherwise be contrary to the international obligations of an injured State vis-à-vis the responsible State, if they were not taken by the former in response to an internationally wrongful act by the latter in order to procure cessation and reparation.”4 In other words, a state whose right has been breached (injured state) by action or omission of another state (responsible state), is allowed to take such measures which would otherwise be contrary to international law in order to force the responsible state to “procure cessation and reparation”.5” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 87)

## 1 Introduction

### State B can lawfully take countermeasures against State A's illegal interference.

> “For example, if state A interferes with electoral processes in state B to push forward a candidate it prefers, it will be in breach of the principle of non-intervention. State B as the injured state would then be in a position to take measures otherwise contrary to its obligation owed to the responsible state, for instance, it could close its airspace for aircrafts from the responsible state in breach of a mutual aviation treaty because the illegality of this act would be precluded by the fact that it has been taken as a countermeasure against predeceasing illegal act by the responsible state. However, such measure would have to be in conformity with conditions stemming from international law for countermeasures, which will be discussed in detail below, and could only be used to induce the responsible state to cease the breach of law and, if reasonable, to provide reparation. Countermeasures cannot be used to punish the responsible state.6” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 87)

## 1 Introduction

### Paragraph content is not provided.

> “This paper focuses mainly on the countermeasures in cyberspace (also “cyber countermeasures”), since a lot of questions remain unanswered as regards the application of international law in the cyber realm. In particular, the relationship between countermeasures and the principle of due diligence, the possibility of collective countermeasures, countermeasures against non-state actors operating abroad, or countermeasures crossing the threshold of the prohibited use of force. All of these issues will be addressed and hopefully, some light will be shed on them using and analyzing public statements by states and international organizations made in recent years in relation to using countermeasures in cyberspace.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 87)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace

### Countermeasures are recognized as legal justifications under international law.

> “Countermeasures constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, which has been codified in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter “ARSIWA”).7 Although the Draft Articles are of non-binding character, the criteria for the application of countermeasures set forth herein represent a generally accepted standard.8 This is evidenced by the fact that they have also been adopted almost in full in the Tallinn Manual, which provides as a general rule that “a State may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not, in response to a breach of an international legal obligation that it is owed by another State”.9 However, this does not mean that the application of this legal institute in the cyber context does not give rise to controversy.10 Nevertheless, these seem to be fading into the background and there is a gradual shift in the debate from the question of “whether” countermeasures can be applied in cyberspace to the question of “how” to apply them. This shift is demonstrated by the fact that the latest report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (hereinafter “UN GGE Report 2021”) adopted by the UN General Assembly includes the following formulation: “An affected State’s response to malicious ICT activity attributable to another State should be in accordance with its obligations under (...) international law, including those relating to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means and internationally wrongful acts.”11 It is the reference to “internationally wrongful acts” that can then be interpreted as an indirect reference to countermeasures.12” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 88)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace

### The implementation of countermeasures is bound by specific conditions to ensure security and prevent escalation.

> “However, the implementation of countermeasures is not, of course, a question of the arbitrariness of states, but can only be resorted to under a number of conditions that not only limit the general applicability of countermeasures, but also have a major impact on what specific measures can be taken.13 Respect for these conditions leads to a reduction in the risk of unplanned escalation, limits the possibilities for abuse of the countermeasures and guarantees “international stability and security”.14 The second part of the article is devoted to their analysis. The conditions are divided into groups in accordance with the ARSIWA structure, i. e. material (“requirements of the situation”) and procedural (“conditions of implementation”).15” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 89)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions

### Countermeasures require an internationally wrongful act by the responsible state.

> “The basic prerequisite that must be fulfilled in order for countermeasures to be available to the injured state is the existence of an internationally wrongful act attributable to the responsible state.16 Only in such a case, subject to the fulfilment of the other conditions analyzed below, can measures be taken which are themselves contrary to international law but whose wrongfulness is precluded precisely because they fulfil the definition of countermeasures.17” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 89)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.1 Attribution of a conduct to the responsible state

### Attribution remains a significant challenge in cyber law.

> “Attribution, i.e., establishing and proving the legal responsibility of a particular state for a cyber operation, is one of the main challenges of cyber law.18 While in the case of a conventional operation, such as the firing of a missile from the territory of one state onto the territory of another state, there is usually a lot of concrete evidence of the originator of the attack, the situation is quite different for cyber operations. Not only is it a problem to trace the specific attacker (i.e. the device from which the operation was carried out, so-called technical attribution), but even if the injured state is successful in this step, the link between the responsible state and this attacker (legal attribution) must be proven.19 Given that a significant part of cyber operations are carried out by non-state actors, this step can also be highly problematic.20 Yet legal attribution of the cyber operation to the responsible state is a prerequisite for the implementation of countermeasures.21 While technical attribution is primarily related to available evidence (IP addresses, location, etc.), legal attribution is a legal consideration based on articles 4 to 8 of ARSIWA, which regulate the rules for deriving legal responsibility of states for internationally wrongful acts. In general, states are responsible for the actions of their own authorities and armed forces, but may also be held responsible for the actions of non-state actors (e.g. private entities directed by the state), provided other conditions are met.22” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 89)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.1 Attribution of a conduct to the responsible state

### Injured states face risks of misattribution during cyber operations.

> “As the perpetrators of cyber operations often actively try to hide their identity (spoofing), or conduct operations from or through the territory of third states, injured states are at risk of misattribution.23 An example is the cyber operation carried out by North Korea against servers in South Korea in 2013, which used computers in forty countries.24 It is clear that most, if not all, of these countries had nothing to do with this cyber operation. If an injured state misidentifies a responsible state and takes countermeasures against an innocent third state based on that misattribution, it may itself be committing an internationally wrongful act. The scholarly debate then turns to the question of whether this wrongfulness is affected by conduct in good faith. According to one group of scholars, acting in good faith makes countermeasures legal even against a third state.25 Most authors, however, hold that good faith does not liberate the injured state of its legal responsibility.26 The latter view is then the official position of both the International Law Commission and the Tallinn Manual 2.0.27 The risk of misattribution is one of the reasons why countermeasures should be approached with caution, which is also emphasized in official opinions by some States, such as Brazil or the United States.28” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 90)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.1 Attribution of a conduct to the responsible state

### Current law does not require prior evidence for implementing countermeasures.

> “Another issue related to attribution is the burden of proof. Is the state implementing countermeasures obliged to provide prior evidence that the target state is indeed responsible for the malign cyber operation? Current international law does not impose such a condition.29 However, from the point of view of the legitimacy of the measures taken in the eyes of the international community, it is more than advisable that such evidence be made public, either before or after the implementation of countermeasures.30 Indeed, the UN GGE Report 2015 states that “accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated”.31 Conversely, if there is a judicial review of countermeasures, depending on the judicial authority, the injured State will be required to produce evidence (meet burden of proof) at the level of “clear and convincing evidence”.32 This issue was then aptly described by Canada in its official statement when it stated that “[a] State taking countermeasures is not obliged to provide detailed information equivalent to the level of evidence required in a judicial process to justify its cyber countermeasures; however, the State should have reasonable grounds to believe that the State that is alleged to have committed the internationally wrongful act was responsible for it”.33” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 91)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.2 Breach of international obligation

### An internationally wrongful act requires a breach of international obligation by the responsible state.

> “Internationally wrongful act is an action or omission that is attributable to the responsible state and “constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the state”.34 It thus contains three elements, namely that it is (1) an act (2) attributable to the state and (3) in breach of international law.35 The existence of an internationally wrongful act that violates a legal obligation owed to the injured state is a condition sine qua non for any countermeasure, as confirmed by the International Court of Justice (hereinafter “ICJ”) in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case.36 Since the first element does not pose a problem in practice and the second has been discussed above, it is now necessary to focus only on the third defined element, i.e. breach of international obligation by the responsible state.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 91)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.2 Breach of international obligation

### International obligations arise from both customary law and treaty law, and their violation constitutes an internationally wrongful act.

> “International obligations can stem from both customary international law (e. g. prohibition of the use of force, principle of non-intervention) and treaty law (e. g. mutual aviation treaty).37 Violation of both types of obligations constitutes an internationally wrongful act. An example of such an act is the conduct of a cyber operation against a coastal state from a ship sailing in its territorial waters, which constitutes a violation of the innocent passage regime. Failure to respect the principle of due diligence may also constitute a breach of an international obligation, which will be discussed below.38 However, the principle of sovereignty is the most susceptible to violation, as it applies to all cyber infrastructure located within the territory of a state, and therefore any cyber operation against that infrastructure may also constitute a violation of an international obligation.39” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 92)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.2 Breach of international obligation

### The injured state is responsible for assessing breaches of international obligations when determining countermeasures.

> “As already indicated above in the section dealing with the burden of proof, it is the injured state that carries out self-assessment as regard fulfillment of conditions of countermeasures. Therefore, it is also for the injured state to consider whether the responsible state has breached an international obligation owed to the injured state. If the injured state makes an erroneous judgment in this respect (i.e. if it considers the breach of international obligation to be a legal act of the other state or if it does not interfere with the rights of the injured state), it will itself bear responsibility for any breach of international law by its alleged countermeasure.40” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 92)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.3 Purpose

### Countermeasures must induce compliance with international obligations.

> “Countermeasures can only be implemented “in order to induce the responsible state to comply with its obligations under Part Two [of ARSIWA]”.41 This specifically means “to cease the internationally wrongful conduct, if it is continuing, and to provide reparation”.42 Reparation refers to the potential injury suffered by the injured state.43 The term “injury” is to be understood in the sense of Article 31 ARSIWA as “any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act”.44” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 92)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.3 Purpose

### Countermeasures aim to rectify the illegal situation, not to punish the responsible state.

> “Countermeasures are therefore not a means to punish the responsible state, but can only aim at correcting the illegal situation, providing compensation, returning to the status quo and possibly also providing guarantees from the responsible state.45 If the measures taken pursued the objective of punishing the responsible state, they would not be countermeasures and the injured state would itself have committed an internationally wrongful act.46 A related point is that countermeasures are permissible only if they can succeed in achieving permissible objectives. Otherwise, it would be mere retaliation not authorized by law.47” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 93)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.4 Unbreachable obligations

### The ILC identifies obligations unaffected by countermeasures in ARSIWA.

> “ILC listed a set of obligations which shall not be affected by the countermeasures in art. 50 of ARSIWA. These include the obligation to refrain from breaching the prohibition of threat or use of force, protection of fundamental human rights, obligations of humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals, other peremptory norms, other mutual dispute settlement procedure and the principle of inviolability of diplomatic premises.48” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 93)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.4 Unbreachable obligations

### The classification of fundamental human rights is contentious in relation to countermeasures.

> “The possible forceful countermeasures and prohibition of the use of force will be thoroughly discussed below. When it comes to fundamental human rights, there is a general consensus that not all human rights enshrined in, inter alia, international treaties fall into the category of “fundamental” rights that cannot be interfered with through countermeasures. The question of which rights should be included in this category is a matter of debate. The ILC refers to those human rights “which may not be derogated from in time of war or other public emergency”.49 Typically, these include the right to life, health or the prohibition of torture and slavery.50 Also norms of humanitarian law, captured in particular by the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols, cannot be breach by countermeasures.51 These humanitarian rules are directly reflected in the crimes defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.52 In view of these rules, a cyber operation aimed at interrupting the supply of water and electricity to a medical facility, for example, would be inadmissible.53 A right which, on the other hand, cannot be subsumed under “fundamental” rights is the right to free and democratic elections.54 At the same time, however, the above prohibition on violating fundamental human rights does not mean that countermeasures taken cannot have a negative impact on these rights, since such a strict interpretation of the prohibition on interference with these rights would preclude almost any countermeasure.55” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 94)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.4 Unbreachable obligations

### The right to privacy's classification as a fundamental right is debated in the context of countermeasures.

> “In the context of cyber operations, the obvious risk is the interference with the right to privacy. The question is whether this right can be classified as a “fundamental” right.56 The authors of the Tallinn Manual could not reach consensus on this point.57 Although the right to privacy is undoubtedly one of the most important human rights, it is a right that can be interfered with in certain cases (e.g. in criminal proceedings).58 At the same time, if we put the above-mentioned rights (life, health, etc.) and the right to privacy side by side, it is clear that the consequences of an interference with these rights are very different, both in terms of the severity of the interference with the individual’s personal life and in terms of the possibility of redress or compensation. One may therefore be inclined to conclude that the right to privacy may be infringed by countermeasures, of course to a reasonable extent (see proportionality below).” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 94)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.4 Unbreachable obligations

### Cyber operations that incite genocide violate peremptory norms and cannot be deemed legal countermeasures.

> “A similar question to that of fundamental human rights relates to “other peremptory norms”. Which rules of international law fall into this category? The word “other” obviously refers to the previous rules (art. 50 para. 1 letter a), b), c) ARSIWA), which include a number of peremptory norms. One of the “other” peremptory norms is undoubtfully the prohibition of genocide.59 It should be emphasized that even “mere” incitement is a violation of this norm. Thus, one can easily imagine a cyber operation aimed at spreading disinformation and manipulating data, the very purpose of which is to incite genocide. Such operations cannot be considered legal countermeasure.60” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 94)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.4 Unbreachable obligations

### Determining peremptory norms is crucial as their violation could invoke collective countermeasures.

> “Deciding whether a particular right or obligation falls under peremptory norms (jus cogens) is then important not only because it precludes countermeasures, but also because peremptory norms create an obligation erga omnes, i.e. towards all states, and their violation by one state could potentially allow for collective countermeasure.61 A separate section of the text below is devoted to this topic.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 95)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.5 Treaty limitations (and exclusions)

### Countermeasures can be excluded by treaties, which may take precedence over international norms.

> “The right to take countermeasures does not have the status of peremptory norms and therefore the application of this institute can be excluded by treaties.62 It can be a bilateral or multilateral treaty. Typically, it will be the exclusion of the enforcement of obligations under the treaty through countermeasures and this regime will be replaced by another mechanism.63 For example, the founding treaties of the European Union establish a specific regime for enforcing compliance with EU obligations.64 This regime takes precedence over countermeasures.65” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 95)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.6 Temporary

### Countermeasures are temporary measures intended to restore legal situations.

> “The temporal character of countermeasures follows logically from their purpose. Countermeasures are not intended to lead to the establishment of a new permanent state of affairs, but are a temporary measure taken with a view to restoring the ordinary legal situation.66 This means that countermeasures are to be terminated when they have fulfilled their purpose (“responsible State has complied with its obligations of cessation and reparation”).67 This therefore establishes the latest point in time until which countermeasures can last.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 95)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.6 Temporary

### Countermeasures can only be enacted in response to an existing wrongdoing.

> “In terms of timing, attention should also be paid to when countermeasures can be started. Unlike the right of self-defence, international law does not operate with the concept of anticipatory countermeasures.68 Thus, their implementation cannot be undertaken preventively, but can only be used in response to an already existing internationally wrongful act, as confirmed by the ICJ in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project judgment.69 This, of course, also precludes countermeasures from being used as a means of deterrence.70” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 95)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.6 Temporary

### Injured states must retain the capacity to terminate countermeasures once objectives are achieved.

> “Based on the above, it can be concluded that an injured state that proceeds with cyber countermeasures must retain the technical capacity to terminate them the moment it achieves the legitimate objective pursued. Therefore, it is not possible, for example, to launch a malicious code (virus) programmed to destroy data into the responsible state’s system as a countermeasure without the injured state having the capacity to deactivate the virus. Nor can countermeasures be used to justify pre-emptive cyber operations that violate another state’s sovereignty or another rule of international law.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 96)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.7 Reversibility

### Countermeasures in cyberspace must prioritize reversibility for adherence to international obligations.

> “The ILC has commented on the topic of reversibility of countermeasures and so did the ICJ in its case law.71 Countermeasures must be reversible, but this condition is not absolute.72 Indeed, the relevant rule of ARSIWA speaks of the need to adopt countermeasures that “as far as possible” allow “resumption of the obligation in question”.73 The ILC itself then explains the use of the phrase “as far as possible” to mean that if the injured state has a choice of several appropriate and effective countermeasures, it should choose such measures as will allow the resumption of the performance of the suspended obligation.74 In doing so, a distinction must be made between the reversibility of the measure itself (restoring respect for the international legal obligation) and the reversibility of the effects of the measure (repairing the damage caused by the countermeasures).75 The requirement of reversibility relates only to the reversibility of the measure itself.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 96)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.7 Reversibility

### The injured state is not obliged to compensate the responsible state for financial losses resulting from countermeasures.

> “Therefore, reversibility cannot be seen as meaning that the injured state should in any way compensate for the losses incurred by the responsible state as a result of the countermeasures. For example, if the injured state chooses as a countermeasure a cyber operation against the critical financial infrastructure of the responsible state, thereby temporarily disabling it, it will undoubtedly cause financial losses on the part of the responsible state, but it will not be obliged to compensate for those losses.76” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 96)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.7 Reversibility

### Countermeasures that cause irreversible harm to the responsible state are not automatically excluded from consideration.

> “By the same token, while a number of countermeasures may deprive the responsible state of the opportunity to carry out certain activities, which may harm it in an irreversible way, this does not mean that such measures are a priori excluded.77” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 96)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.8 Proportionality

### Proportionality of countermeasures must consider both quantitative and qualitative factors.

> “For proportionality ARSIWA contains a special rule: “Countermeasures must be commensurate with the injury suffered, taking into account the gravity of the internationally wrongful act and the rights in question.”78 The question of proportionality of countermeasures was also addressed by the ICJ in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros case.79 The ILC Commentary further specifies that “proportionality must be assessed taking into account not only the purely ‘quantitative’ element of the injury suffered, but also ‘qualitative’ factors such as the importance of the interest protected by the rule infringed and the seriousness of the breach”.80 In doing so, it is necessary to take into account not only the breached right of the injured stated, but also the right of the responsible state do which the countermeasure will be affected.81 Injury in this context does not necessarily refer to any material damage, but is the very violation of the right of the injured state.82 In other words, proportionality in the context of countermeasures must be assessed in relation to the injury caused, and the injury caused by the countermeasures must not significantly exceed the injury caused by the conduct of the responsible state.83” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 97)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.8 Proportionality

### case basis and does not imply reciprocity.

> “The aspect of proportionality is very abstract. Proportionality has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.84 However, the key point is that proportionality in no way implies reciprocity in the sense of using the same means or targeting against the same right.85 Thus, for example, a restriction on the right of innocent passage in the form of a naval blockade may be responded to by a cyber operation directed against the sovereignty of the responsible state and vice versa.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 97)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.8 Proportionality

### defense, focusing on the injury caused.

> “It should further be emphasized that the proportionality of countermeasures is a concept distinct from proportionality in the right of self-defense.86 In the case of countermeasures, the comparative criterion is not the necessity of the measure to achieve the objective pursued (cessation and reparation), but proportionality in relation to the injury caused.87 Thus, whereas in self-defense the consequences of the measures taken may cause significantly greater harm than that caused by the armed attack which activated the right of self-defense, if this is necessary to prevent a further armed attack, in countermeasures the condition of proportionality is more stringent and may lead to the situation that, although the injured state would have the means available to achieve the objective pursued, it will not be able to use them because the injury caused by them will be disproportionate in relation to the injury suffered.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 98)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.8 Proportionality

### Cyber countermeasures pose risks of unintentional overreach and require careful consideration.

> “Similarly, proportionality of countermeasures should be distinguished from the concept of proportionality in humanitarian law.88 It is impossible to fully estimate and control impact of cyber countermeasures on the responsible state (and possibly also third states).89 By comparison, if as a countermeasure the airspace of an injured state is closed to aircrafts registered in a responsible state, the consequences of such a measure (number of flights affected, economic impact,...) can be estimated quite accurately. On the other hand, if malware is used as a countermeasure and released into the responsible state’s network with the aim of removing important data, it is often not possible to estimate the extent to which the data will be damaged and whether unplanned spread of the malware beyond the target facilities will occur and thus lead to a more significant interference with the rights of the responsible state, given the limited level of control and planning. From the above, it is clear that cyber countermeasures entail a significant risk of unintentional overreach and their use requires a high degree of prudence on the part of the injured state.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 98)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.1 Material conditions:2.1.9 Necessity

### Countermeasures require necessity linked to purpose and proportionality.

> “Necessity is closely linked to the purpose and the proportionality of countermeasures. Countermeasures are available only if they are necessary to achieve the purpose of cessation and reparation.90 In order to conclude that countermeasures are indeed necessary, the injured State must comply with Article 52 of ARSIWA, which contains the procedural conditions for their application. This means in particular to make a “prior demand” that the responsible state ends the breach of international obligation and an offer to negotiate.91 Only if, even in response to this demand, the responsible state does not put an end to the unlawful situation, does it open the way for countermeasures. However, these procedural conditions can be omitted in the case of so-callled urgent countermeasures (see below).92” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 98)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.2 Procedural conditions

### Countermeasures require compliance with procedural conditions for legality.

> “So far we have been dealing with material conditions. However, countermeasures are also constrained by several procedural requirements, by which we must understand the concrete steps in relation to the responsible state that must precede countermeasures. These are (1) an obligation to request cessation of the internationally wrongful act and/or provide reparation93 and (2) “to notify the responsible state of any decision to take countermeasures and [3] offer to negotiate with that state”.94 Compliance with these conditions is a prerequisite for the legality of subsequent countermeasures.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 99)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.2 Procedural conditions

### Urgent countermeasures can sometimes bypass notification requirements to protect state rights.

> “While the necessity to request the responsible state to terminate the unlawful situation must be insisted upon even in the context of cyber countermeasures (especially for reasons of possible “spoofing”, i.e. masking the real originator),95 the other two conditions (to notify, to negotiate) can exceptionally, according to the prevailing opinion,96 be waived with reference to so-called urgent countermeasures if it is “necessary to preserve [the injured state’s] rights”.97 These “rights” include both the rights violated and the right to take countermeasures.98 The main reason why prior notification to the responsible state of planned cyber countermeasures may be problematic is that the responsible state could subsequently take measures that would reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of such cyber countermeasures altogether.99 Conversely, one cannot agree with the view of Katharine Hinkle, according to whom the case for urgent countermeasures is also supported by the fact that “were the perpetrating state to receive notice [...] it could easily ‘immunize’ itself [...] by ending the cyber-assault”.100 Indeed, the author overlooks that the possibility of ending the wrongful act by the responsible state is the very reason why the state is notified. As noted above, this procedural condition is a corollary of the material condition of necessity.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 99)

## 2 Countermeasures in cyberspace:2.2 Procedural conditions

### Not all states agree on the necessity of prior notification for urgent countermeasures in cyberspace.

> “On the other hand, however, it cannot be overlooked that not all states accept the view that urgent countermeasures can be undertaken without prior notification. Canada for example considers that procedural aspects of countermeasures, including notification, need “to be further defined through state practice given the unique nature of cyberspace”.101 However, the prevailing view, even among states (France,102 Israel,103 Italy,104 Netherlands,105 Norway,106 Sweden,107 United States108 or United Kingdom109) is that urgent countermeasures without prior notification can be taken, particularly in cyberspace. At the same time, however, these states stress that this is an exception to the general notification obligation, which remains an established procedural condition of countermeasures. These procedural conditions balance the “self-appreciation” of the fulfilment of the material conditions by the injured state,110 reduce the risk of unplanned escalation and prevent misattribution.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 100)

## 3 Contentious issues

### The focus shifts to contentious issues related to countermeasures.

> “While the first part of the text was devoted to countermeasures in general, the conditions of their admissibility and the relationship between this legal institute and cyberspace, the second part will focus on the contentious issues associated with countermeasures. These are the link between countermeasures and the principle of due diligence, countermeasures and the use of force and finally the question of collective countermeasures.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 100)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.1 Countermeasures and due diligence

### Countermeasures require legal attribution of cyber conduct to a state.

> “It has already been mentioned that one of the main practical obstacles to countermeasures is the requirement to legally attribute the conduct (which breaches the international law) to a particular state. Unless this requirement is fulfilled, there is no space to launch countermeasures.111 This means that even if an injured state has sufficient evidence that a cyber operation is being conducted from the territory of a concreted state, it may not be able to infer the legal responsibility of that state. However, this very situation may open the door for countermeasures for breach of the due diligence principle.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 101)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.1 Countermeasures and due diligence

### Due diligence obliges states not to allow misuse of their territory for wrongful acts.

> “Due diligence means that each state has an obligation “not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states”.112 However, it must be stressed that the existence of this rule in customary international law is controversial and the practice of states is fragmented in this respect.113 It is not the subject of this article, however, to examine the existence of this rule and, since it has been incorporated into the text of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (rule 7 or 6), it will continue to be assumed that states do have such an obligation under international law.114” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 101)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.1 Countermeasures and due diligence

### Territorial states must act to prevent known cyber operations but are not liable if incapable.

> “Applied in cyberspace, then, the obligation of due diligence implies the obligation of the territorial state (the state from whose territory the cyber operation is carried out) to prevent the execution of that operation if it becomes aware of it (or should have become aware of it).115 This is not a obligation of prevention, but an obligation to act, so there is no need to take any precautionary measures or to monitor one’s own cyber infrastructure.116 An example is when a terrorist organization misuses cyber infrastructure on the territory of a state to attack another state and the attacked state informs the territorial state of the attack. The state is then obliged to take action, within its capabilities, against the terrorist activity. The principle of due diligence does not require that the intervention be effective, but it must be within the capabilities (especially technical capabilities) of the territorial state (“take all feasible measures”).117 A territorial state that does not have sufficient technical capability to stop a cyber operation cannot therefore be responsible for a breach of the principle of due diligence.118 If a territorial state does not act in accordance with due diligence, even though it has the technical capacity, it is itself in breach of international law (committing an internationally wrongful act) and thus runs the risk of countermeasures being used against it.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 102)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.1 Countermeasures and due diligence

### Injured states may counter territorial states or directly intervene against cyber operations.

> “In such a situation, the injured state has two options how to approach countermeasures. The first way is to use countermeasures against the territorial state (its authorities) and thus force it to take action against a terrorist cyber operation.119 The second, and arguably more effective remedy, is direct action against a terrorist operation on the territory of the territorial state.120 The second option will in fact constitute a violation of the territorial state’s sovereignty, but the illegality of this action will be precluded precisely by the fact that it will be a countermeasure. Particularly in the case of direct intervention, then, care must be taken to ensure that the threshold of the use of force or armed attack is not crossed (see below).” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 102)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.1 Countermeasures and due diligence

### Countermeasures must be proportional to the breach of due diligence, not to the cyber operation damage.

> “In this context, the rule of proportionality should be recalled and emphasized. As explained, countermeasures have to be proportionate to the injury suffered. In the case of a breach of the principle of due diligence, it is the breach of due diligence (“the failure to take appropriate measures”) and not the (cyber or other) operation itself that is the injury.121 Therefore, the countermeasure taken must be proportionate to the breach of due diligence and not to the consequences of the operation itself.122 This will often mean that the injured state will not have available a sufficiently effective countermeasures because such measures would be disproportionate. In such a situation, it may be appropriate to consider other measures on the basis of, for example, plea of necessity, other circumstances precluding wrongfulness.123” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 102)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Countermeasures risk crossing the threshold of force.

> “Article 50(1)(a) of ARSIWA provides that “Countermeasures shall not affect the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force” as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.124 Yet the possibility of countermeasures crossing the threshold of the use of force remains an open question.125 In particular, the fact that the right of self-defense, otherwise one of the few exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force, is only available to states when an “armed attack” occurs opens up space for this debate.126 Armed attacks are cases of serious violation of the prohibition on the use of force.127 Thus, there are acts that, while constituting a violation of the prohibition of the use of force, do not rise to the level of an armed attack.128 Even so, they are of course violations of international law, which opens the door to countermeasures. And it is here that the question arises whether these specific violations of the prohibition of the use of force below the armed attack threshold could be defended against by countermeasures of the same intensity (i. e., use of force but below the armed attack threshold).129” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 103)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Determining the intensity of cyber operations is problematic.

> “In this context, it should be also pointed out that it is problematic to determine which cyber operations reach the intensity of use of force or armed attack.130 Doubts exist in particular in the case of operations against critical infrastructure.131 A related problem is the limited ability to estimate the actual impact of a cyber operation, which may thus cross the threshold of not only use of force but also armed attack accidentally. 132” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 103)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Prevailing view limits countermeasures to less potent uses of force.

> “The prevailing view is that even against these less potent uses of force below the threshold of an armed attack, countermeasures of equal intensity cannot be used. This view follows not only from ARSIWA but also from the case law of the ICJ and is held by most experts.133 The main argument of the proponents of the opposite approach, then, is that if the injured state were to be victimized by a use of force (cyber or not) below the armed attack threshold, it could not afford to defend itself in a similar manner, although it is generally entitled to a proportionate response.134 In support of this position, these authors often refer to the separate opinion of Judge Simma in the Oil Platforms Case, which they interpret in favour of forcible countermeasures.135” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 103)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Restrictive approach against forcible countermeasures is more convincing.

> “While one can understand the arguments for both approaches, the more restrictive approach of not allowing forcible countermeasures seems more convincing.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 104)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Legal arguments favor opponents of forcible countermeasures.

> “In legal terms, the arguments on the side of the opponents of forcible countermeasures are generally stronger. This is not only the aforementioned ICJ case law and the enshrinement of the rule in ARSIWA, but in particular the prohibition on the use of force in the UN Charter must be taken into account. As a peremptory norm of international law, arguably one of the most important norms, which can be derogated from only exceptionally on the basis of the right of self-defense or with the consent of the UN Security Council, it deserves the highest degree of caution when establishing exceptions to it (restrictive approach). The proponents of forcible countermeasures have put forward completely insufficient arguments from this perspective. Although Judge Simma is undoubtedly one of the greatest authorities on international law, his one dissenting opinion cannot be equated with the opinions of the ICJ, ILC and the UN Charter.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 104)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Pragmatic concerns about escalatory risks exist with forcible countermeasures.

> “There are also purely pragmatic arguments against forcible countermeasures. In particular, the risk of escalation.136 It is not possible to clearly define which minor act already fulfils the characteristics of an armed attack.137 This problem becomes even more pronounced in the cyber context (for example, it is not clear whether the mere destruction of data can constitute a use of force or not).138 Allowing the use of force as a countermeasure in response to such ambiguously classified actions may lead to a more intense counter-reaction by the responsible state, and it is not difficult to imagine a gradation to the level of armed attack and subsequent armed conflict.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 104)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Uniform state positions oppose justifying force through countermeasures.

> “Finally, the recent practice of states in the form of official national positions on applicability of international law in cyberspace is quite uniform. Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom and even Russia have opposed the possibility of justifying any use of force on the basis of countermeasures.139 These are overwhelmingly post-Tallinn Manual 2.0 opinions, and if a minority of experts in this publication lean towards the possibility of forcible countermeasures, it seems safe to conclude that this possibility is indeed ruled out, taking into account this subsequent state practice.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 104)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.2 Forcible countermeasures

### Forcible countermeasures are deemed out of the question in cyberspace.

> “On the basis of all these arguments, it can therefore be concluded that forcible countermeasures are completely out of the question, and unless there is a fundamental change in state practice, which does not seem likely, this debate can be considered essentially closed, at least in cyberspace.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 105)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.3 Collective countermeasures

### The status of collective countermeasures in international law is unclear and controversial.

> “While the right to collective self-defense is enshrined directly in the UN Charter,140 the status of a similar rule for countermeasures in international law is unclear and controversial.141 Although examples of collective countermeasures have appeared throughout history, the ILC refers to them as “controversial” and “embryonic”.142 Yet, this issue is significant in the context of cyber operations, as many states do not possess sufficient technical capacity to be able to implement effective cyber countermeasures on their own.143 At the same time, there is a relatively well-developed international cooperation in the field of cyber operations (e.g. NATO Rapid Reaction Team)144 and it is therefore necessary to examine what are the limits of cooperation between states, whether third states can assist the injured state in implementing countermeasures or even implement it fully on its behalf.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 105)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.3 Collective countermeasures

### injured states can implement countermeasures for injured states.

> “There are several perspectives on collective countermeasures, which are clearly summarised in the commentary to rule 24 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0. According to the final version of this rule “only an injured state may engage in countermeasures”.145 However, the commentary reveals the complexity of the problem. Several experts took the position that a non-injured state may implement countermeasures on behalf of an injured state on the request of that state.146 The majority, however, was opposed.147 Even more fragmented then was the debate on the possibility of mere assistance by the injured state.148 The structure of the debate is similar in the broader context. Some authors strictly reject collective countermeasures,149 while others see limited scope for their implementation.150” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 105)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.3 Collective countermeasures

### Schmitt and Watts argue that collective cyber countermeasures are lawful despite variations in state practice.

> “Schmitt and Watts thoroughly analyzed the issue of cyber countermeasures in 2021 and concluded that “collective cyber countermeasures ... are lawful.” They support this conclusion by noting that there is no clear prohibition of collective countermeasures in international law, international law generally tends towards a “collectivist approach”, the specific nature of cyberspace requires a greater degree of tolerance of countermeasures, and allowing collective countermeasures is fully consistent with the “object and purpose of the rule of countermeasures”.151 However, this conclusion still seems too strong compared to recent state practice.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 106)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.3 Collective countermeasures

### Estonia explicitly recognizes the legality of collective countermeasures, while other states have mixed positions.

> “Estonia is the only country that explicitly and unequivocally takes the position that collective countermeasures are legal.152 New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Poland are less explicit, but still in favour of collective countermeasures.153 On the other hand, France takes a completely negative position and Canada considers that there is not yet sufficient “state practice and opinion juris” for collective countermeasures.154” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 106)

## 3 Contentious issues:3.3 Collective countermeasures

### Current trends indicate increased tolerance for collective cyber countermeasures within international law.

> “On the basis of all the above, it can be concluded that Catherine Lotrionte’s conclusion expressed in 2018, that the issue “has yet to be resolved, leaving open the further development of the law through state practice and opinion juris and the possibility for collective, or third-party, cyber countermeasures” remains valid.155 At the same time, however, it must be acknowledged that both expert debate and state practice are moving towards an increasing tolerance of collective countermeasures, at least in cyberspace. Unless this trend changes, we can expect this new dimension of countermeasures in customary international law to stabilize in the coming years.156” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 106)

## Conclusion

### Countermeasures in international law are restricted by specific conditions.

> “Coutnermeasures constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness that may allow the injured State to effectively protect its own rights. However, the application of this concept of international law is limited by a number of material and procedural conditions that must be insisted upon.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 107)

## Conclusion

### The article highlights emerging trends in cyber countermeasures.

> “The aim of this article was to explore the possibilities of applying countermeasures in cyberspace and in particular to take into account recent state practice and development in scholarly debate. It is clear that this institute has received considerable attention from both states and scholars. This paper described some of the apparent trends relating to the application of countermeasures in cyberspace.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 107)

## Conclusion

### Attributing cyber operations to responsible states presents significant challenges.

> “In general, it can be stated that there can no longer be any doubt that countermeasures are also applicable in cyberspace, but in this context one of the main obstacles to their application remains the need to attribute the malign conduct (cyber operation) to the responsible state. Compliance with the proportionality requirement in the case of cyber countermeasures may also be a specific challenge due to the limited predictability of the consequences of such a cyber operation and its controllability. Regarding procedural conditions, it is necessary to highlight in particular the growing support for urgent countermeasures not requiring prior notification of the responsible state.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 107)

## Conclusion

### Due diligence violations can facilitate countermeasures against non-state actors.

> “In the second part of the article, attention was paid to the contentious issues associated with countermeasures. The principle of due diligence, respectively its violation by a territorial state, can open the door to countermeasures targeting not only that state, but also directly against non-state actors operating from its territory. It is precisely through the violation of due diligence that it is possible to circumvent the condition of attributability of the state’s actions (in relation to malign cyber operations), which can be quite crucial for the injured state.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 107)

## Conclusion

### Growing support for collective countermeasures may influence international law.

> “The last segment was dedicated to collective countermeasures. The possibility of their implementation remains controversial, but in recent years there has been growing support for them both in academia and in state practice. Unless this trend changes, collective countermeasures may soon become a stable part of international law.” (Spáčil, 2023, p. 108)
