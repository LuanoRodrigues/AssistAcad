Schmitt ed., 2013) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL] (defining cyber operations as \"the employment of cyber capabilities with the primary purpose of achieving objectives in or by the use of cyberspace\"). Cyber operations include cyber attacks and cyber exploitation. Cyber attacks are those cyber operations, whether in offense or in defense, intended to alter, delete, corrupt, or deny access to computer data or software for the purposes of (a) propaganda or deception; (b) partly or totally disrupting the functioning of the targeted computer, computer system, or network with any related computer-operated physical infrastructure; and/or (c) producing physical damage extrinsic to the computer, computer system, or network. Cyber exploitation refers to those operations that access other computers, computer systems, or networks, without the authorization of their owners or exceeding the limits of the authorization in order to obtain information, but without affecting the functionality of the accessed system or amending/deleting the data resident therein. For a discussion of these definitions, see MARCO ROSCINI, CYBER OPERATIONS AND THE USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW 10-18 (2014)."}
