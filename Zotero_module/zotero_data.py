Each element should be identified and discussed in relation to the content of the document. Provide explanations for the selected research type(s) directly in your analysis, along with citations that exemplify or can be interpreted as representing these research types. Similarly, outline the research problem directly before delving into the research questions and hypotheses, ensuring each is supported by direct references from the text. Here is how to structure your findings in an HTML format: <div> <h3>Research Type:</h3> <ul> <li>Exploration</li> <li>Description</li> <li>Evaluation</li> </ul> <p>[Provide an explanation for the selected research type(s) based on the document's content.]</p> <blockquote>'[Citation that can be interpreted as the research type.]'</blockquote> <h3>Study Objectives</h3> <ul> <li>[Objective 1: Specific objective of the study]</li> <li>[Objective 2: Another specific objective of the study]</li> <!-- Add more objectives as necessary --> </ul> <h3>Research Problem</h3> <ul> <li>[The main problem the research aims to solve or the 'problematique' of the research]</li> </ul> <h4>Research Questions</h4> <ul> <li>Question 1: [Specific research question]</li> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this question.]'</blockquote> <h5>Hypotheses</h5> <li>Hypothesis 1: [Specific hypothesis related to Question 1]</li> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this hypothesis.]'</blockquote> <!-- Repeat the pattern for additional questions and hypotheses --> </ul> </div> This format ensures a detailed and structured analysis, clearly presenting the study's foundational elements with direct references from the document.",
        "<h2>1.2 Key Terms Definitions</h2>": "Guidelines:\nPrepare an HTML document that defines key terms as outlined by the author in the attached PDF document, incorporating direct quotes for these definitions. Each term's explanation should be followed by a citation in the proper author, year, page format. This structured approach is designed to enhance the clarity and accuracy of the terminology presentation. ### Example HTML Structure for Correctly Formatted Key Terms Definitions: ```html <div> <h3>Key Terms Defined by the Author</h3> <h4>Adverse Cyber Operation</h4> <blockquote>“Accordingly, an adverse cyber operation is the employment of cyber capabilities with the purpose of causing harm in or by the use of cyberspace.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> </div> ``` Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual page numbers where these quotes can be found in the document. This structure is devised to ensure a detailed and accessible presentation of key terms with direct quotes from the document, correctly formatted to include author, year, and page number for precise referencing.",
