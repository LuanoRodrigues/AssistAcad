        "<h2>1.2 Key Terms Definitions</h2>": f"Guidelines:\nPrepare an HTML document that defines key terms as outlined by the author in the attached PDF document, incorporating direct quotes for these definitions. Each term's explanation should be followed by a citation in the proper author, year, page format. This structured approach is designed to enhance the clarity and accuracy of the terminology presentation. ### Example HTML Structure for Correctly Formatted Key Terms Definitions: ```html <div> <h3>Key Terms Defined by the Author</h3> <h4>Adverse Cyber Operation</h4> <blockquote>“Accordingly, an adverse cyber operation is the employment of cyber capabilities with the purpose of causing harm in or by the use of cyberspace.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, p. XX)</blockquote> </div> ``` Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual page numbers where these quotes can be found in the document.

        "<h2>2.4 Author References</h2>": f"Guidelines:\nTo analyze the attached PDF document,focusing exclusively on the significant references made within, specifically from authors (not companies or entities). Your analysis should be structured into two primary sections with the following detailed tasks and presented in the given HTML format: 1. **Footnotes Examination:** Carefully go through all footnotes to identify key citations from authors. For each significant author citation, you are to: - Determine its relevance by matching the citation number with its context in the text. - For each cited author, use an HTML `<h5>` tag for the bibliographic reference. - Provide a context block detailing the significance of the citation within the document, followed by a direct quote or summary. Immediately after the context, include the direct citation from our document, precisely indicating the author's name, year, and page. Ensure this analysis includes more than five author citations for depth. 2. **Author-Year Style References:** Search for and analyze any references made in the author-year style within the text. If absent, explicitly note 'NA' in this section. Here's an HTML template for your output, emphasizing author contributions and direct citations within the analysis context: ```html <div> <h3>Principal Authors Referenced in the Research</h3> <h4>Footnotes Style</h4> <div> <h5>Marco Roscini (2015)</h5> <p>'Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations,' <em>Texas International Law Journal</em>, 50(2), 233-256.</p> <blockquote> Context: Roscini's insights are leveraged to delve into the evidence complexities in cyber operation state responsibility cases.
