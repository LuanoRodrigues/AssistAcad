Each element should be identified and discussed in relation to the content of the document. Provide explanations for the selected research type(s) directly in your analysis, along with citations that exemplify or can be interpreted as representing these research types. Similarly, outline the research problem directly before delving into the research questions and hypotheses, ensuring each is supported by direct references from the text. Here is how to structure your findings in an HTML format: <h3>Study Objectives</h3>  <li>[Specific objective of the study]</li> <li>[Another specific objective of the study]</li> <!-- Add more objectives as necessary -->  <h3>Research Problem</h3> <li>[The main problem the research aims to solve or the 'problematique' of the research]</li> <h3>Research Questions</h3> <h4>Question 1: [Specific research question]</h4> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this question.]'</blockquote> <h3>Hypotheses</h3> <h4>Hypothesis 1: [Specific hypothesis related to the previous question]</h4> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this hypothesis.]'</blockquote><h4>Assumption 1: [Specific assumption related to the previous question]</h4> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this assumption.]'</blockquote>  This format ensures a detailed and structured analysis, clearly presenting the study's foundational elements with direct references from the document. split your response in two: one exactly as instructed and the next prompt I will ask you additional research question number 2 along with eveything after eg. assumption, hypothesis...
