This includes statements followed by a number or a number in brackets/parentheses (e.g., 'international relations theories such as realism and neoliberalism are mainstream¹' or 'international relations theories such as realism and neoliberalism are mainstream (1)'). Check if the same number corresponds to a statement preceded by the same number (e.g., '1. John S Davis II and others, ‘Stateless Attribution: Toward International Accountability in Cyberspace’ (RAND Corporation 2017) 21.'). If a sentence is preceded by a number and this number is found following a sentence, it means this is an in-text citation and a corresponding footnote. Identify APA citation style too like (author, year) and its variations. The pattern is statement+ (author,year) or any mention to an author. Focus in getting the following:\n. 1. Authors: References with footnote or in (author, year) citation style, focusing exclusively on authors (not companies or entities). 2. Entities: References in various formats, focusing exclusively on entities such as organizations and governmental bodies. 3. Legal Cases: Any reference to a legal case.

You are tasked with evaluating the student's assignment on exploratory data analysis (EDA) concerning air quality and citizen health. Your feedback should be detailed, specific, directly tied to the student's submission, not exceed 250 words, and match the style from the provided feedback examples document. Follow the structured feedback format below, ensuring to cite relevant parts of the assignment. Avoid generic comments and focus on the content provided. Know that the first document is the student assignment entitled anonymous. Read the later line by line before providing feedback. the second  is the Assignment Feedback Summary document containing positive feedback and recommendations which serves as a reference for you.

**Assignment Expectations and Feedback Points:**

**What was asked:**
- Undertake exploratory data analysis (EDA) with a broad topic: briefing the mayor on the relationship between air quality and citizen health to lead a global policy knowledge community.
- Report key findings and considerations for the mayor, including key aspects of how the EDA generated those findings.
- Include a discussion of how London compares to other cities around the world.
- Discuss how air quality and health interact and differ between cities with different characteristics (e.g., population size, exercise levels, or modal split).

**Guidelines for Specific Feedback:**
- Focus on the student's responses to the key questions and the assignment rubric.
- If the student does not explore the mayor’s stated interest in air quality and citizen health or comparison with other cities or regions, note this and advise them to always be guided by the intended uses of their work. Where not feasible, they should clarify why.

**Intended Learning Reinforcement:**
- Understand the iterative approach of exploratory analysis.
- Recognize the role of multiple data types/sources and/or methods in eliciting ‘information’ from ‘data’.
- Demonstrate use of analytic methods introduced throughout the course.
- Understand the importance of clearly labeling analysis and figures and reporting sources/types of uncertainty.
- Appreciate the significance of individual judgment in appraising the relevance of the reported analysis.
- Use visualization to effectively communicate analytic insights.

**Feedback Structure:**

<h1> Feedback:[total marking score here]</h1>
**Positive Feedback and Recommendations:**
- Use the "Assignment Feedback Summary" document to provide specific positive feedback and recommendations.
- Select appropriate points from the summary document to integrate into your feedback based on the student's work.
- Ensure the positive feedback highlights strengths related to the assignment guidelines and the recommendations are actionable and clear.

Each element should be identified and discussed in relation to the content of the document. Provide explanations for the selected research type(s) directly in your analysis, along with citations that exemplify or can be interpreted as representing these research types. Similarly, outline the research problem directly before delving into the research questions and hypotheses, ensuring each is supported by direct references from the text. Here is how to structure your findings in an HTML format: <div> <h3>Research Type:</h3> <ul> <li>Exploration</li> <li>Description</li> <li>Evaluation</li> </ul> <p>[Provide an explanation for the selected research type(s) based on the document's content.]</p> <blockquote>'[Citation that can be interpreted as the research type.]'</blockquote> <h3>Study Objectives</h3>  <h4>[Specific objective of the study]</h4> <h4>[Another specific objective of the study]</h4> <!-- Add more objectives as necessary -->  <h3>Research Problem</h3> <h4>[The main problem the research aims to solve or the 'problematique' of the research]</h4> <h3>Research Questions</h3> <h4>Question 1: [Specific research question]</h4> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this question.]'</blockquote> <h4>Hypotheses</h4> <h5>Hypothesis 1: [Specific hypothesis related to Question 1]</h5> <blockquote>'[Direct citation from the text supporting this hypothesis.]'</blockquote> <!-- Repeat the pattern for additional questions and hypotheses -->  </div> This format ensures a detailed and structured analysis, clearly presenting the study's foundational elements with direct references from the document.{note}",
        "<h2>1.2 Key Terms Definitions</h2>": f"Guidelines:\nPrepare an HTML document that defines key terms as outlined by the author in the attached PDF document, incorporating direct quotes for these definitions. Each term's explanation should be followed by a citation in the proper author, year, page format. This structured approach is designed to enhance the clarity and accuracy of the terminology presentation. ### Example HTML Structure for Correctly Formatted Key Terms Definitions: ```html <div> <h3>Key Terms Defined by the Author</h3> <h4>Adverse Cyber Operation</h4> <blockquote>“Accordingly, an adverse cyber operation is the employment of cyber capabilities with the purpose of causing harm in or by the use of cyberspace.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> <h4>Causality</h4> <blockquote>“Causality is a purely factual issue and asks whether a cyber operation can be traced to a particular computer system and even more importantly to a particular person, group of persons, or entity.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> <h4>Attribution</h4> <blockquote>“In contrast, attribution of the conduct of a particular person, group of persons, or entity to a particular State is primarily a normative issue.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> <h4>Standard of Proof</h4> <blockquote>“The standard of proof denotes the degree of probability that must be achieved for the trier of facts to determine the factual allegation is correct.” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> <h4>Active Defense</h4> <blockquote>“Indeed some scholars conclude that countermeasures against adverse cyber operations may take the form of so-called ‘active defenses’ or ‘active cyber defenses,’ which are ‘in-kind response(s) ... against the attacker’s system.’” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> <h4>Due Diligence</h4> <blockquote>“...with regard to adverse cyber operations causality, attribution, and evidentiary issues are also and decisively informed by the exercise of due diligence (or lack thereof) by the State of origin...” (Aravindakshan, 2021, page number)</blockquote> </div> ``` Note: Replace 'XX' with the actual page numbers where these quotes can be found in the document.
