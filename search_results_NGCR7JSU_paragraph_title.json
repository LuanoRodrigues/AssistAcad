The fifty-six-page indictment alleges violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, and computer damage. The indictment also includes charges of economic espionage and trade secret theft. Other indictments have followed. For example, in 2017, a federal grand jury indicted two Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers for directing a hack that compromised 500 million Yahoo accounts. And in early 2020, a federal grand jury indicted four members of China's PLA for the 2017 hack of consumer credit reporting agency Equifax--a breach that compromised the personal information of 145 million U.S. victims (USDOJ, 2020).\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 106)", "\u201cThe United States has used its improved capabilities to make a number of public attributions in recent years. Public attributions by the U.S. government take one of four forms: (1) criminal indictments; (2) economic sanctions; (3) technical alerts; and (4) official statements or press releases. If a public attribution is not made it does not mean that attribution has not taken place. For example, attribution can take place through various forms of retaliation including unattributed attacks. Table 1 highlights some recent cyber-attacks and the type of threat, impact on the victims, and how the victim state chose to attribute the attack. It is important to note that to date no cyber threat or attack has been treated as an act of war despite the seriousness and the extent of the damage. As we will see in the next section the decision to treat an attack as a criminal act depends largely on the ability to prove the case in a court of a law based on widely disparate legal systems around the world.\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 104)", "\u201cThe problem, then, is not in identifying the source of an attack. The challenge is in convincing other states that a source has correctly been identified. A state that wishes to employ countermeasures needs to convince other states of the accuracy of its attribution in order to establish the legitimacy of its attack. This issue may arise for two main reasons: (1) attribution may be based on data collected through state espionage or intelligencegathering efforts that states may wish to keep secret; and (2) when states have plausible factual bases for attributing an attack, they may not want to disclose such evidence, since cyber attackers could learn from those mistakes and avoid leaving the same fingerprints in the future (Tran, 2019)\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 106)", "\u201cThe second part of any legal analysis of attribution requires an understanding of the right of a victim state to take countermeasures against a state sponsored attack (Banks, 2019). If a state is victimized by an internationally wrongful act below the use of force threshold, the \u201cState may be entitled to take countermeasures, whether cyber in nature or not\u201d (Tallinn at 111). Countermeasures are responses that otherwise would violate international law, designed to prevent a responsible state from continuing its unlawful cyber intervention\u201d (Tallinn at 111).\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 104)", "\u201cLegal scholars have also noted the need for accountability at the international level when one country is wrongfully attacked by another (Kuntz, 2013). For example, the United States\u2019 Cyber Economic Espionage Accountability Act expresses the sense of Congress that cyber economic espionage should be a priority issue in all economic and diplomatic discussions with the People's Republic of China, with the Russian Federation and other countries determined to encourage, tolerate, or conduct such cyber economic espionage (USDOJ, 2014). Scholars recognize that States must develop accountable attribution mechanisms for international law to have practical value in the cyber sphere (Banks, 2019).\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 107)", "\u201cImportantly, the United States has not taken a standardized approach to attribution\u2014either in the timing of attribution, the mode, the type, or the extent of evidence supporting the attribution, the confidence level, or whether attribution is followed by other punitive measures (Romanosky and Boudreaux, 2020). For example, the 2017 attribution of WannaCry and the 2018 attribution of NotPetya involved coordinated statements with international partners; however, in the Equifax cyber-attack, it was the private company that worked with the UK and Canadian regulators to determine appropriate next steps. Leveraging the capabilities of the private sector is a significant strategy that has been used by the United States and other countries.\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 104)", "\u201cAs the most advanced cyber states recognize the risks of cyber escalation, those states have good reason to become more transparent about attribution in service of the mutual restraint that could be gained by sharing attribution information. But to date, state concerns about revealing intelligence sources and methods counsel against transparency. (Banks, 2019)\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 106) (Greiman, 2021, p. 106)", "\u201cCyber attribution is a topic covered quite extensively in the literature however, the legal requirements of attribution are clearly lacking due to the failure of a universal consensus on the laws, regulations and standards that are applicable when attributing a cyber-attack to a state-sponsored entity. As shown in figure 1, this paper explores the relationship between the law of attribution, the evidence required to prove attribution, and the responses that nation states have chosen when faced with decisions that require careful evaluation of the interests faced by the victim nation including economic, social, political, and national security interests. The research comprises a review and comparative analysis of the international law governing attribution, the applicable rules of evidence, and the analysis of recent literature including government and private sector studies that analyze state responses to cyber-attacks.\u201d (Greiman, 2021, p. 103)"], "paragraph_blockquote": ["<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\" data-annotation=\"%7B%22attachmentURI%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FLJJ6ILJJ%22%2C%22pageLabel%22%3A%22106%22%2C%22position%22%3A%7B%22pageIndex%22%3A4%2C%22rects%22%3A%5B%5B72.024%2C696.3699999999999%2C523.2164720399996%2C706.3299999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C684.1299999999999%2C522.7637800799998%2C694.0899999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C672.0099999999999%2C523.1887234799999%2C681.9699999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C659.7699999999999%2C523.22337416%2C669.7299999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C647.5299999999999%2C522.7638000000002%2C657.4899999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C635.4099999999999%2C522.96625692%2C645.3699999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C623.1699999999998%2C522.9530399999999%2C633.1299999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C610.9299999999998%2C523.0746018%2C620.8899999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C598.6599999999999%2C523.21264%2C608.6199999999999%5D%2C%5B72.024%2C586.5399999999998%2C239.68350008000004%2C596.4999999999999%5D%5D%7D%2C%22citationItem%22%3A%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F9047943%2Fitems%2FNGCR7JSU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22106%22%7D%7D\">\u201cThe first public attribution by the U.S. Department of Justice came in the form of an indictment in 2014, when a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five members of China's PLA Unit 61398, for hacking and conspiring to hack companies, including Westinghouse and U.S. Steel, in order to steal intellectual property (USDOJ, 2014).
